<div class="parispanel"> 



<p><strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Understanding that we must proceed with a cautious, slow return to a full and active life on our beautiful campus, the Fall 2020 semester will begin as scheduled on Monday, August 24, 2020, and will end on Saturday, December 12, 2020. During the semester, we will observe current state guidance on occupancy limits, physical distancing, safety, hygiene, and related mitigation measures. Prior to Thanksgiving, students have options for their academic experience through </span><a href="http://www.marywood.edu/covid19"><b>Marywood&rsquo;s HyBridge Education Model</b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. However, all coursework, including finals, will be held</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> totally online between Thanksgiving and the end of the semester </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">(approximately a two-week period). When students leave campus for Thanksgiving Break, they will not return until the beginning of the spring semester in January 2021.</span></strong></p>

<p><strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Marywood&rsquo;s academic team has devised a distinctive, versatile approach to instruction:&nbsp;</span><a href="http://www.marywood.edu/covid19"><b>Marywood&rsquo;s HyBridge Education Model</b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This is a blended model of learning that takes a flexible approach to preserve the safety of students and faculty and deliver a high high-quality educational experience. To provide a consistent learning experience for all students, all course content will be available online. However, students will have the option of choosing how they participate in class. Options include controlled, limited in-person settings that follow safety guidelines, remote instruction, or a combination of the two. This flexible approach allows students to build their own educational experience while preserving their safety.</span></strong></p>

<p><strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">We have been working to determine the methodology for the re-entry of students into the residence halls for the 2020 fall semester. All residence halls will be sanitized according to ACHA (The American College Health Association) and CDC regulations over the summer. We have accounted for spacing and movement and have planned to offer primarily single room occupancy to all students until the rooms are filled. Typically, all freshmen and sophomores who reside beyond 50 miles of Marywood are required to live on campus. This requirement will be relaxed, if necessary, for sophomores for this year and only for this year. When rooms are filled, students interested in living on campus will be placed on a waiting list. Please understand that these temporary measures are being put into place to comply with best practices and government guidelines for safety. Once we are allowed to operate in an unrestricted manner, these measures will be adjusted. A survey/intent form will be sent via email to those students who lived on campus in spring 2020 and to commuter students who previously expressed interest in living on campus. Following that, additional information about residence life, signing up for rooms, consideration for graded reimbursement in the event of an altered schedule, and safety will be sent to all students requesting housing.</span></strong></p>

Most clinical programs are utilizing telehealth options to complete field and internship experiences. Field experiences, such as practicums and student teaching, will follow Pennsylvania Department of Education guidelines. In light of COVID-19 and the closure of K-12 schools, these guidelines currently offer a modified path to meet PDE requirements for field experiences.&nbsp; We anticipate that PDE will offer further guidance on how students may fulfil its field experience requirements during the 2020-2021 academic year. The School of Education continues to be in close communication with PDE as it plans for the upcoming academic year.</span></strong></p>

We appreciate your patience and understanding in this unprecedented time. Once a final procedure is in place, the University will notify you and will begin the credit/reimbursement process.

<div class="parispanel"> 



<p><b><i></i></b></p>
<p><b><i>Certification and Allocations:</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> On April 16, 2020, Marywood signed and returned to the Department of Education the Certification and Agreement and the assurance that the institution has used, or intends to use, no less than 50 percent of the funds received under Section 18004(a)(1) of the CARES Act to provide Emergency Financial Aid Grants to students. Marywood University received $2,020,450 from the CARES Act. Fifty percent (50%) of those funds or $1,010,225, was allocated for Emergency Financial Grants to Students. These funds were received on May 7, 2020.&nbsp; As of May 15, 2020, $836,900 Emergency Financial Aid grants were allocated to students.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><i>Eligibility of Students/Disbursement of Funds:</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> At Marywood, there are 2,282 students eligible to participate in programs under Section 484 in Title IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965 and thus eligible to receive Emergency Financial Aid Grants to students under Section 18004(a)(1) of the CARES Act. As of May 15, 2020, there have been 985 students who have received an Emergency Financial Aid Grant.</span></p>
<p><b><i>Methods of Determination/Guidance to Students:</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> To determine which students received allocations of Emergency Financial Aid Grants, as well as how much they received, under Section 18004(a)(1) of the CARES Act, Marywood devised and used formulas based on need (according to financial aid records) and the cost of attendance. Students were told that the funds from the Emergency Financial Aid Grants were allocated to cover expenses related to the disruption of campus operations due to coronavirus, including eligible expenses under a student&rsquo;s cost of attendance, such as food, housing, course materials, technology, health care, and child care. They were also asked to indicate how they generally intended to use their allocation to offset those expenses.</span></p>
