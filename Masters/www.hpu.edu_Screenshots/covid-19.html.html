<h3>HPU 7/2 Update on Fall 2020</h3>
<p>Aloha HPU&#160;&#8216;Ohana,</p>
<p>Included with this message is a<span>&#160;</span><a href="https://forms.hpu.edu/view.php?id=982059">brief questionnaire</a><span>&#160;</span>that all students must complete before July 10.&#160;</p>
<p>We appreciate your patience as opportunities continue to arise that will help bring about the start of the HPU Fall 2020 semester. Hawai&#8216;i&#8217;s COVID situation remains mild. We continue to believe that once our students are all here, they will be in a very safe place as we move together through the fall, and beyond.&#160;</p>
<p>As we shared in our most recent message, students and any accompanying family members who will travel to Honolulu from outside of Hawai&#8216;i may now obtain negative PCR test results three days before arrival in Hawai&#8216;i and avoid the state&#8217;s mandatory 14-day quarantine.&#160; We are working diligently with government officials to create an alternative option, and will let you know as soon as we have any additional details to share.&#160;</p>
<p>Please remember that if no COVID-19 test is taken, and with a negative result, students and their accompanying family members must follow the same 14-day quarantine period and protocol as other visitors and local residents. This means you would need to arrive in Hawai&#8216;i by August 10, with arrangements to quarantine, in order to be cleared by the first day of classes on August 24.&#160;</p>
<p>In the meantime, we expect to have news to share with you, perhaps as early as next week, about a special discount program specifically for university students traveling to and from Hawai&#8216;i that will be in place through the end of the year.&#160;</p>
<p>Campus-wide preparations for a safe and socially distanced experience are nearly complete. We have shared a good bit about our classrooms and study areas, but I also want to emphasize that our campus housing will meet all CDC, State of Hawai&#8216;i and City and County of Honolulu guidelines.&#160;&#160;</p>
<p>Among the modifications we&#8217;ve put into place at both our Aloha Tower Marketplace and Hawai&#8216;i Loa Campus are:&#160;</p>
<ul>
<li>reduced density in the dorms,</li>
<li>reconfigured rooms and furniture,</li>
<li>plexiglass shields where appropriate, such as in some of our bathroom counters, and</li>
<li>other measures to comply with CDC and government guidelines.</li>
</ul>
<p>We are also instituting enhanced cleaning and sanitization measures in our dorms and common areas, as well as across all of our facilities. In addition, we will be instituting daily temperature checks and health screenings for students, faculty and staff.&#160;</p>
<p>We will approach fall with our Hawaiian value, pono, with each of us promising to follow the directives and guidelines that are all aimed at helping us ride out the pandemic together.&#160;</p>
<p>We will continue to update you as we prepare for the start of the semester and, as always, we welcome your questions.&#160;</p>

<h3>HPU 6/26 Update on Fall 2020</h3>
<p><br/>Aloha HPU Students,</p>
<p>We have been busy preparing for the Fall semester, and we can't wait to welcome you back to our beautiful campus! For those of you who are returning, our classrooms will look a little bit different as we adjust our in-person activities to meet new health and safety standards. For example, individual desks have been spread out to ensure appropriate social distancing; faculty will be meeting with fewer students at a time to provide intentional and meaningful in-person instruction; and, in some cases, the scheduling of individual courses has been adjusted to accommodate a more flexible class schedule.</p>
<p>Along those lines, classes that were originally scheduled for Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, will now meet on Mondays and Wednesdays for a slightly longer time period. In addition, we have lengthened the time between classes from 15 minutes to 30 minutes to give you more time to get to your next location, and we have added a few additional sections of classes at our downtown and Hawai&#8217;i Loa campus locations.</p>
<p>Starting Tuesday, June 30, you will able to see these changes in your&#160;<a href="http://my.hpu.edu/">MyHPU</a>&#160;portal. We will also soon post a print version of the master fall schedule on the&#160;<a href="https://www.hpu.edu/registrar/index.html">HPU website</a>&#160;to assist you if you would like an easier way to explore additional course options.&#160;</p>
<p>In addition, our advising staff and College faculty and administrators will be on standby ready to assist you if you have questions about the new schedule or if you need to make additions or other changes to accommodate your specific needs:</p>
<p>&#183;&#160;<strong>NEW STUDENTS</strong>&#160;(first-year and transfer) should contact our advising office to&#160;<a href="https://www.hpu.edu/academic-advising/index.html">make an appointment.</a>&#160;You can also&#160;<a href="mailto:advising@hpu.edu%20">email</a>&#160;or call 808.544.1198 with any questions. Please note: First-year students who have been placed in MATH 1105, WRI 1000, or WRI 1050 should be sure to complete&#160;<a href="https://www.hpu.edu/cas/testing/placement-testing.html">placement testing</a>&#160;as soon as possible to ensure accurate placement in required Math and Writing courses.</p>
<p>&#183;&#160;<strong>CURRENT AND RETURNING STUDENTS</strong>&#160;should contact their regular Faculty Advisor or their College administrator identified below:</p>
<p>o College of Business:&#160;<a href="mailto:adatta@hpu.edu">Asoke Datta, Assistant Dean</a><br/>o College of Health and Society:&#160;<a href="mailto:jsmitten@hpu.edu">Jayne Smitten, Associate Dean</a><br/>o College of Liberal Arts:&#160;<a href="mailto:lleach@hpu.edu">Laurie Leach, Associate Dean</a><br/>o College of Natural and Computational Sciences:&#160;<a href="mailto:cjones@hpu.edu">Carolyn Jones, Associate Dean</a><br/>o College of Professional Studies:&#160;<a href="mailto:yvance@hpu.edu">Yvonne Vance, Assistant Dean&#160;</a></p>
<p>Also, further details about travel options for new and returning students are just about finalized, and we are excited to share those details with you early next week. Please stay tuned!<br/><br/></p>

<h3>HPU 6/24 Update on Fall 2020</h3>
<p>Aloha HPU &#8216;Ohana,<br/><br/>We have some good news that should begin to ease many minds about travel to campus in August.<br/><br/>Governor David Ige today announced a pre-travel, COVID-19 testing protocol that will enable our out of state students and their family members wishing to accompany them to avoid the strict 14-day quarantine that has been in effect since March 26. Under this new program, starting August 1, travelers who obtain a negative FDA-approved PCR test for COVID-19 from a CLIA-certified laboratory before arriving in Hawaii will be able to avoid the mandatory quarantine.<br/><br/>This development, in and of itself, is a major step in the ongoing efforts to facilitate our return to our in-person, on-campus Fall 2020 semester. We also hope to announce some other steps that could provide additional options for those students and their families who are unable to obtain a test prior to arriving in Hawai&#8216;i.<br/><br/>HPU is additionally looking at a discounted testing partnership with a nationwide pharmacy or testing lab, as well as other ways to offset any expense our students and families may incur in obtaining COVID-19 tests. We will continue to share any and all updates with you as our state and local governments continue in their efforts to manage the response to the pandemic.<br/><br/>Our local students here in Hawai&#8216;i should continue with their plans to arrive on campus for the start of the semester.<br/><br/>For our mainland and international students, the state&#8217;s new advance-test program will reduce the risk of introducing more COVID-19 cases in Hawai&#8216;i, as well as transmission during travel. In addition, it will ease one&#8217;s transition upon arrival in the islands. The vigilance here in Hawai&#8216;i has helped to keep the COVID-19 rates of incidence, hospitalization, and deaths the lowest in the entire nation. We can truly say that Hawai&#8216;i is the safest place in the nation during this pandemic, and we will work together to ensure that our campus culture is in step with the statewide commitments to staying safe and healthy.<br/><br/>We will continue to share with you the many steps we have taken to provide social distancing and hygienic sanitization across campus. Furthermore, we are working on a program to test at the outset all students and staff living on campus. And, we will be announcing soon our new orientation program and fall activities schedule. We are excited to create an excellent university experience together.<br/><br/>Please watch for more messages in the coming days and weeks and, again, I hope today&#8217;s development helps many of you in your planning.</p>
<p>Mahalo,</p>
<p>John Y. Gotanda</p>
<p>President</p>

<h3>FRIDAY, JUNE 19, 2020<br/>HPU 6/19 UPDATE ON FALL 2020</h3>
<p>Aloha HPU &#8216;Ohana,</p>
<p>Here in Hawai&#8216;i, we have experienced a steady progression of reopenings, signaling a careful return to normal activities. Beaches, parks, restaurants, shopping, and now inter-island travel, are all open again. Hawai&#8216;i&#8217;s COVID-19 infection numbers are the lowest in the country, and we expect the strong, statewide management to continue. Importantly, we met with City and County of Honolulu Mayor Kirk Caldwell and he approved our resumption of in-person instruction, paving the way for our fall semester to begin on August 24.<br/><br/>We are very much aware that you have many questions, particularly those of you who must arrange travel to Hawai&#8216;i.<br/><br/>I want you to know that State of Hawai&#8216;i officials have been working on guidelines that will allow for the lifting of or exemptions to the 14-day mandatory quarantine for out-of-state travelers. At the same time, we have joined with other universities in Hawai&#8216;i in asking Governor David Ige for modified requirements for university students should the travel quarantine, which is set to expire at the end of July, be further extended. We hope to receive word from state officials next week, and we will reach out to you immediately. <br/><br/>We also will be following up with regular communications from now until the start of Fall semester to help you to prepare for the new features of the HPU experience as we continue our journey, together, through the pandemic. Coming messages will include details of facilities modifications like socially distanced classrooms, dining, residential and study spaces; our updated class schedule; new health screening protocols and new requirements, like the use of face coverings; plus details of some of the ways we will modify student life activities to provide the opportunities that enrich the HPU experience.<br/><br/>The health and safety of our entire &#8216;ohana is our top priority. It&#8217;s still beautiful, peaceful, and sunny here in Honolulu, and we can&#8217;t wait for the start of Fall.<br/><br/>Mahalo,<br/><br/>John Y. Gotanda<br/>President</p>

<h3>WEDNESDAY, MAY 20, 2020;<br/>HPU campus preparations update</h3>
<p>Aloha Students,</p>
<p>We are moving forward with preparations for an in-person, on-campus 2020-21 academic year, beginning this August. HPU employees began their gradual return from telework this week, and we continue to receive encouraging updates from local and state governments as public activities are being phased back in. Of course, social distancing is going to be with us, but there may be no better place on earth to experience year-round sunshine and a wonderful breeze than right here in Honolulu.</p>
<p>I want to give you an update on some of the ways we will be ready for you in August. We will continue to communicate with you in the coming weeks, and I would ask that you share these updates with family members, especially parents.</p>
<p><strong><u>Campus Spaces will be Safe</u></strong></p>
<p>&#8226; The university has conducted a space study and will implement a plan for fall semester that ensures social distancing within our classes and labs, with at least six feet between people.</p>
<p>&#8226; We will also modify some large meeting areas to create additional, open classroom space. Our Facilities team is already working on preparing our class and study spaces with amply distanced seating.</p>
<p>&#8226; We will continue the social distancing measures in our dining, housing, and other common-space facilities, and we are repurposing other spaces for additional dining, recreational and student uses.</p>
<p>&#8226; The university has also put in place personal hygiene and facilities-disinfecting protocols, and cloth masks are required in public.</p>
<p>&#8226; We expect campus will become much more active over the coming month. HPU is considered an essential business by the city and state.</p>
<p><strong><u>Hawai&#8217;i is Relatively Healthy</u></strong></p>
<p>&#8226; We are pleased that Hawaii is considered one of the healthiest states in the nation, with only 640 COVID-19 cases. As a result, we are now seeing a gradual lifting of stay-at-home restrictions, and fully anticipate the resumption of in-person instruction on August 24.</p>
<p><strong><u>Travel&#8212;When to Arrive</u></strong></p>
<p>&#8226; We do anticipate that travel restrictions will also be relaxed, particularly if there is not a significant jump in COVID-19 cases in the coming weeks. While we expect the eventual removal of the current State of Hawai&#8216;i 14-day quarantine period for anyone traveling to Oahu, we are making arrangements, just in case, to comply with any orders that may be in place in August.</p>
<p>&#8226; Details will be finalized and shared in upcoming messages as we work to make our dorms and other residential facilities available for student move-in as early as August 10, if they choose to do so. HPU will not charge any additional fees for early occupancy prior to the start of classes.&#160;</p>
<p>&#8226; While Hawai&#8216;i&#8217;s continued positive health reports and government actions to reopen the State&#8217;s economy point to the lifting of the quarantine by August, it also may be possible to be exempted from the full duration of any quarantine that may exist if we can arrange for voluntary COVID-19 testing immediately upon arrival. We are working with government officials and medical providers on bringing that program to fruition.</p>
<p>We are so excited to see a return to normal on the horizon, and we are very much looking forward to seeing you on campus. Lots of details are still coming together and, again, we will keep you updated and hope you will stay in touch and let us help you with any other questions.</p>
<p>Mahalo,</p>

<h3>Tuesday, May 5, 2020<br/>HPU will be ready for fall</h3>
<p>Aloha HPU Students,<br/>We&#8217;ve made it through a semester no one could have imagined, and I want to tell you, once again, that I am proud of you and the entire HPU &#8216;Ohana for the many ways we&#8217;ve stuck together and prevailed under very challenging circumstances.<br/> <br/>I write today to confirm our plan to be in-person, on-campus when we open our fall semester on August 24. Hawaii continues to prove itself to be one of the healthiest places in the world, with only a little over 600 COVID-19 cases to date and nearly the lowest per capita rate of COVID-19 in the United States. At HPU, our highest priorities are the health and safety of our students and our community. To that end, we will have in place for the fall enhanced social distancing in our facilities, including in all of our classrooms, reduced density in our dorms, new health screenings, and enhanced cleaning protocols.<br/> <br/>We recognize that, in light of the pandemic, the financial situations of many students and families may have changed. If that is the case, please submit your updated <a href="https://studentaid.gov/">FAFSA</a> applications, and submit your <a href="https://forms.hpu.edu/view.php?id=877862">CARES Act - Economic Impact Survey</a> if you haven&#8217;t done so yet. Our financial aid office is standing by to help address any questions or concerns you may have. Please contact them at <a href="mailto:financialaid@hpu.edu">financialaid@hpu.edu</a>.</p>
<p><br/>We will keep you updated in the coming weeks. We are planning a great 2020-21 academic year in one of the most beautiful and safest places on earth. I look forward to welcoming you back to campus soon.<br/> <br/>Mahalo,<br/><br/>John Gotanda<br/>President</p>
<hr/><hr/>
<h3>FRIDAY, APRIL 24, 2020<br/>UPDATE ON CAMPUS OPERATIONS</h3>
<p>Aloha HPU Students,</p>
<p>Mahalo for the many ways you have shown your commitment to your studies and to finishing the semester under these unprecedented circumstances. To our graduating students, congratulations! We will be sending you off with incredible pride, some sadness over the modified ways we must celebrate your commencement, and with great confidence that you will make your marks on the world in the wake of this unexpected experience.</p>

<p>You may have heard that Mayor of the City and County of Honolulu, Kirk Caldwell, has extended through May the order that residents stay in their homes, as we continue to turn the tide on the spread of COVID-19.

<h3>Tuesday, APRIL 7, 2020<br/>sUMMER ONLINE PROGRAMS</h3>
<p>Dear HPU Students,&#160;</p>
<p>I hope that this note finds you and your families and friends well, as we all do our part to help combat the spread of COVID-19 through sheltering-in-place. Additionally, I trust you are adjusting to the shift to online instruction well. If you are experiencing challenges, your HPU faculty and staff &#8216;ohana&#160;are here for you. We provide services including&#160;<a href="https://www.hpu.edu/health-services/counseling.html">counseling and behavioral health services</a>&#160;via a phone appointment,&#160;free virtual&#160;<a href="mailto:tutoring@my.hpu.edu">tutoring</a>&#160;and&#160;<a href="mailto:access@hpu.edu">academic coaching,</a>&#160;and online&#160;<a href="mailto:advising@hpu.edu">academic advising</a>.&#160;And if you have not had a chance to check out some of the &#8220;Virtual HPU&#8221; activities,&#160;<a href="http://www.hpu.edu/calendar">www.hpu.edu/calendar</a>,&#160;I encourage you to do so.</p>
<p>As it is still unclear about the timing of returning to our normal routines and environment, HPU has decided to go ahead with<strong>&#160;delivering the full 14-week summer semester and the shorter summer&#160;7A&#160;and 7B&#160;terms&#160;online,</strong>&#160;<a href="http://www.hpu.edu/summer-courses">www.hpu.edu/summer-courses</a>,&#160;because of the COVID-19 pandemic; VA students will still be certified as resident status.</p>
<p>If you are planning to stay in the residence halls over the summer, we have put together a&#160;<strong>summer housing/meal plan/tuition package for current students.&#160;</strong>It represents a significant discount and would replace any institutional aid already awarded to you. The Pell Grant and other federal financial aid would still apply.</p>
<p>There are various rooming options &#8211;&#160;loft&#160;single (first-come, first-served basis),&#160;loft&#160;double, and&#160;loft&#160;quad -- and included is a&#160;7- or&#160;10-meal plan with&#160;flex dollars.</p>
<p>We posted the details of the special offer at&#160;<a href="http://www.hpu.edu/summer-courses">www.hpu.edu/summer-courses</a>.</p>
<p>If you have questions about this special housing, meal plan, and tuition package, feel free to reach out to&#160;us at&#160;<a href="mailto:housing@hpu.edu">housing@hpu.edu</a>.&#160;The&#160;Housing and Residence Life&#160;staff and I are happy to assist you.</p>
<p>My faculty and staff colleagues&#160;and I&#160;are committed to you and your academic journey at HPU and in&#160;Hawai&#8216;i. We wish you nothing but success.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>

<h3>Tuesday, MARCH 24, 2020<br/>confirmed case of covid-19</h3>
<p>Aloha HPU &#699;Ohana,</p>
<p>We were informed recently that an individual at HPU tested positive for COVID-19. It has been 12 days since the individual had contact with students and 11 days since contact with faculty or staff. Most people on campus would not be expected to be at risk. The Hawai&#699;i State Department of Health will be reaching out to persons who had close contact with the affected individual (defined as within six feet for a prolonged period of time).</p>
<p>We are taking every precaution to ensure the safety of our HPU &#699;ohana. Within minutes of receiving the news of diagnosis, we began working closely with the Department of Health, following all their recommended protocols, including having isolated the impacted areas and retained a company that specializes in sanitizing such areas to CDC guidelines.</p>
<p>&#160;Out of respect for medical privacy rights, we are not at liberty to disclose any personal information of the affected individual, other than the individual is recovering quickly, reporting good spirits and strong improvements.</p>
<p>&#160;We will keep you apprised of developments. In the meantime, please continue to do all you can to keep yourself and your loved ones healthy &#8212; observe social distancing, practice thorough hygiene and follow everyday prevention. All of these resources are available to our HPU &#699;ohana via the <a href="https://www.hpu.edu/about-us/news-and-events/news/2020/03/student-message-coronavirus.html">university&#8217;s website</a> and our state&#8217;s informational site at <a href="https://hawaiicovid19.com/">hawaiicovid19.com</a>.</p>
<p>Symptoms of COVID-19 may include fever, cough, and difficulty breathing and can appear 2-14 days after exposure. If you develop symptoms and are concerned about COVID-19 infection, call ahead and discuss with your health care provider. If you have symptoms and were contacted by HDOH regarding exposure to this individual, please inform your healthcare provider of your potential exposure.&#160;</p>
<p>We remain steadfast in our commitment to providing a safe and enriching educational environment and thank you for your ongoing support of and commitment to our HPU &#699;ohana and entire community.</p>
<p>Mahalo.</p>

<h3>THURSDAY, MARCH 19, 2020<br/>CAMPUS FACILITIES UPDATES<br/><br/></h3>
<p>Aloha Students, Faculty and Staff,</p>
<p>I am writing with a number of important updates.&#160;</p>
<p>Beginning Friday, we will move our social-distancing measures to the next level in two very important facilities:&#160;</p>
<ul>
<li>Pier Nine&#160;and the Hawaii Loa Dining Commons&#160;will shift to take-out only service. It will remain open to our students, closed to the public, and Pier Nine will close at 9 p.m.&#160;each night, HLC dining at 8:30 p.m. most nights.&#160;</li>
<li>The eSports Arena is now closed until April 3.</li>
</ul>
<p>Our Student Services Center at Waterfront Plaza remains open, and we will limit the number of people in the common area. Through signage and personal directions, students may need to wait in the outdoor seating areas before entering the center.</p>
<p>HPU&#8217;s military base classes have also shifted to online. Our base offices remain open with social distancing.</p>
<p>Our Library and Learning Commons continue to be open to the HPU community, but not the public generally, and they are subject to social distancing measures.</p>
<p>Finally, with our ATM business neighbors temporarily closed, we want to proactively increase the security services that we provide. Beginning next week, we will temporarily close off some of the areas around ATM to the general public. These areas will remain accessible to the HPU community.</p>
<p>Your health and safety are of paramount importance.&#160;We will continue to keep you informed of developments. Thank you again for all that you are doing to make this week&#8217;s transition to online instruction and effective social distancing come about as smoothly as possible.</p>
<p>Mahalo,</p>
<p>John Gotanda<br/>President</p>
<hr/><hr/>
<h3>WEDNESDAY, MARCH 18, 2020<br/><br/></h3>
<p>Aloha Students,</p>
<p>We know that the past several days have been challenging for you, and we commend you for your perseverance. As we resume instruction today in an online environment, please check Blackboard regularly, along with your HPU email account so that you can receive regular updates from your professors.&#160;</p>
<p>As you are seeing, we have restructured many common areas throughout our facilities to promote social distancing. We have modified some hours of operation, and you may notice that some of our staff members have begun to telework.&#160;</p>
<p>As we celebrated this first year of our expanded downtown campus back in August, we could not have imagined that we would be where we are at this moment. And we won&#8217;t forget these days, but they will pass.&#160;</p>
<p>We want to encourage you to look ahead to a more certain future, so we have opened registration early. You may begin selecting courses for next Fall and Winter now.&#160;<a data-auth="NotApplicable" href="mailto:advising@hpu.edu" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Advising Center staff</a>&#160;are ready to assist students with either an in-person or online appointment, and faculty advisors are also available electronically to meet with juniors, seniors, and graduate students.&#160;</p>
<p>In addition, our Center for Academic Success remains open for in-person and online sessions. Please&#160;<a data-auth="NotApplicable" href="mailto:https://www.hpu.edu/cas/contact.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">contact the staff there directly</a>&#160;to make an appointment for testing and tutoring services.&#160;</p>
<p>The Learning Commons, Waterfront, and Atherton Libraries&#160;<a data-auth="NotApplicable" href="https://www.hpu.edu/libraries/about/library-hours.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">remain open for students</a>, although please note that in some campus areas, capacity at any one time may be limited to accommodate appropriate social (physical) distancing requirements.&#160;</p>
<p>Despite the unfolding pandemic, our commitment to your education remains strong. Our faculty are ready to help you successfully finish the term,&#160;<a data-auth="NotApplicable" href="https://www.hpu.edu/health-services/counseling.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">counselors</a>&#160;are available to talk, and the rest of the student services team is also on stand-by, ready to assist. To that end, if you encounter any difficulties during or after the transition to online instruction, please&#160;<a data-auth="NotApplicable" href="mailto:provost@hpu.edu" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">let us know</a>&#160;right away. Please also encourage your family to stay in touch and to consult our&#160;<a data-auth="NotApplicable" href="https://www.hpu.edu/about-us/news-and-events/news/2020/03/student-message-coronavirus.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">COVID-19 resource page</a>&#160;so that we can answer questions about conditions on campus or in the state of Hawaii.&#160;</p>
<p>Your well-being remains our highest priority, and we look forward to staying in touch in the coming weeks.</p>
<p>Aloha,</p>
<p>John Gotanda<br/>President&#160;</p>

<h3>THURSDAY, MARCH 12, 2020, 9 PM<br/>Update Spring Classes</h3>
<p>Aloha Students,</p>
<p>As you are aware, the COVID-19 situation is developing very quickly. While at this time there is no confirmed case of COVID-19 within the HPU &#8216;ohana or on our campuses, in light of evolving events, heightened anxiety and tremendous uncertainty,&#160;<strong>STARTING ON MARCH 18, 2020, WE WILL BE MOVING ALL CLASSES TO AN ON-LINE FORMAT FOR THE DURATION OF THE SEMESTER. WITH THIS ON-LINE FORMAT, YOU WILL HAVE AN OPTION TO REMAIN ON CAMPUS OR RETURN HOME AND FINISH THE TERM.</strong></p>
<p>The faculty have been thoughtfully preparing for this scenario, and these proactive measures will enable you to complete the semester in a timely manner and ensure that you remain on track for graduation.</p>
<p><strong>CLASSES ON MONDAY AND TUESDAY WILL BE SUSPENDED</strong>&#160;to facilitate the transition and will resume on Wednesday in an on-line format. Faculty will communicate to students their revised course expectations and details for online delivery by Wednesday.</p>
<p>In addition to the on-line instruction, faculty will be available online during regularly scheduled class times and office hours to answer questions and provide advising and guidance. Learning accommodations will continue to apply and faculty are prepared to assist students in that implementation.&#160;</p>
<p>Our faculty are deeply committed to student learning and are looking forward to acknowledging and celebrating student successes at the end of the term.</p>
<p><strong>MILITARY CAMPUS PROGRAMS WILL REMAIN OPERATIONAL AS SCHEDULED UNTIL FURTHER NOTICE.</strong></p>
<p><strong>HPU IS NOT CLOSING FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE SPRING SEMESTER.</strong>&#160;You may continue to live in the residence halls and utilize our facilities and services:</p>
<ul>
<li>All university services, including residences, dining services, academic support services (library, learning commons, computer resources), counseling, and other campus services, including the health clinics, will remain open.</li>
<li>Student employment in work study programs may continue if students wish to do so.</li>
<li>IT support will continue to be available with extended hours to assist you.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>TRAVEL AND EXTRA-CURRICULAR ACTIVITIES. </strong>We have previously announced restrictions on University-sponsored travel, including a prohibition on international travel. In addition, all athletics and co- and extra-curricular activities are suspended for the remainder of the academic year.</p>
<p><strong>SPRING COMMENCEMENT CEREMONY. </strong>We look forward to celebrating with our graduating students at a meaningful ceremony this coming May; those details will be provided at a later time.</p>
<p>We recognize that this message will not answer everyone&#8217;s questions. We will be holding small group sessions tomorrow afternoon to answer individual questions and concerns at the previously scheduled times. Additional clarification will be provided in the days to come.</p>
<p>While we very much regret the disruption this situation causes you and your families, your safety and well being are our highest priority. We are honored that you have chosen to be a part of the HPU community. We are grateful for each of you, and all that you do to make this a special &#8216;ohana.&#160;</p>
<p>Mahalo,</p>
<p>John Gotanda<br/>President</p>

<h3>THURSDAY, MARCH 12, 2020, 4:15 PM&#160;<br/>Friday, March 13 Student Forums: COVID-19 Updates<br/><br/></h3>
<p>Aloha Students,</p>
<p>I want to follow up on my message to you yesterday with an invitation to get together, in person, Friday afternoon (March 13). I&#8217;d like to discuss where we stand in our university-wide response to the coronavirus and, most importantly, hear what&#8217;s on your mind.</p>
<p>Your health and safety are our greatest concerns as we work through this situation. I&#8217;ve also been hearing from a number of your parents and other family members. I want to continue to encourage you to keep in touch and to share with your families the official university information that you receive.</p>
<p>For our discussion tomorrow, we will hold sessions of 45 minutes each, and ask that you sign up in advance for one of the times that fits your schedule. We will limit the number of students in each session to help us keep appropriate social distance as one of our now-ongoing precautions. We will alternate rooms so that after each session, the room that we just used can be cleaned.&#160;</p>
<p>Joining me for each discussion will be Provost Jennifer Walsh and Dean of Students Marites McKee. We will go over our current guidance to campus and talk about various scenarios.&#160;</p>
<p>The meetings will alternate between MPR #2 and MPR #3. Please use the links below to register and attend a discussion tomorrow.</p>
<p><a href="https://forms.gle/cMTrjY2hgqYEakoq9">1 p.m. MPR #2</a></p>

<hr/><hr/>
<h3>WEDNESDAY, MARCH 11, 2020<br/><br/></h3>
<p>Aloha Students,</p>
<p>Mahalo for all of your hard work and for helping to make this a memorable year, particularly with our new facilities at Waterfront Plaza.</p>
<p>Of course, these past weeks have brought challenges as we are all working to understand the spread of COVID-19. Your health&#8212;your physical and mental well-being&#8212;is our highest priority. We continue to monitor the virus-related directives from the federal, state and local governments. We&#8217;ve restricted university-sponsored travel, and we&#8217;ve asked you to let us know if and when you plan to travel. We&#8217;ve taken many other steps to help you stay healthy, including more frequent cleaning and disinfecting schedules in all of our public places, limited access to our Pier 9 dining facility to students only, making sanitizer readily available across our campus, to name a few.&#160;</p>
<p>Within our HPU campus community of students, faculty and staff members, there are no cases of COVID-19, nor has there been any report of symptoms that have warranted testing for the coronavirus. If you have a fever, a cough, or feel sick in any other way, please let your professor know and stay in your room or at home until you feel better. Don&#8217;t go to class sick.&#160;</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve observed other universities take differing approaches as they&#8217;ve addressed the threat of the illness. Here at HPU, the administration, faculty, and staff have been working to plan for many possible scenarios related to the virus. If we determine that it&#8217;s necessary to move to online-only classes, we will be able to do this very quickly. This will not mean that HPU is closed and, in fact, it will likely be the case that the best thing you can do is to stay in your current housing and dine on campus. In addition, even if we move to online-only classes for a short time, we will keep essential student services open, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Housing and Dining Services</li>
<li>Registrar and Financial Aid</li>
<li>Advising</li>
<li>Counseling Services and Health Center</li>
<li>Library and Learning Commons</li>
<li>Career Development Center</li>
<li>College and Department Offices</li>
</ul>
<p>Some of you have expressed concern that HPU might one day surprise you and send you packing. We will not do that. While no one knows how long it will take before the spread of COVID-19 subsides, it will subside and there will be an end to the current outbreak. So, you can count on the university making it as smooth as possible for you to complete this semester, and then we will look forward to welcoming you back to campus for summer or fall.&#160;</p>
<p>The university will be taking some further preventative measures. There will be no university group travel for the rest of this semester unless there is a change in the recommendation from the Hawai&#8216;i Department of Health. We will also forego events that involve large gatherings of 100 or more people. We will continue, at this point, to plan on a traditional commencement ceremony in May at Aloha Tower. If our plans are forced to change, we will work together to develop a meaningful alternative way to celebrate. And, unfortunately, the NCAA announced today that all of its basketball tournaments will be played with a very limited number of fans in attendance. This week brings our first chance to host the regional NCAA Women&#8217;s Basketball tournament with our #1-seed Sharks in the Shark Tank. I hope we all will find many other ways to let our great student athletes know that we are cheering them on toward a national championship.&#160;</p>
<p>For the time being, we will email you regular updates so that you can begin each day with the latest information. In addition, we are working on a plan to talk with you and your parents and families by video, sometime in the coming week. I&#8217;ll announce details shortly and ask that you please help spread the word back home and let your folks know that we want to answer any questions that they may have. In the meantime, we will update you regularly.</p>
<p>HPU is a great university, and that&#8217;s in larger part thanks to each of you. Again, there will be an end to the virus outbreak. We will work together to handle the challenges of today, and we won&#8217;t lose sight of all the great tomorrows that lie ahead.</p>

<h3>WEDNESDAY, MARCH 4, 2020<br/>New HPU Requirement: Report Travel to Countries with COVID-19 Level 2 or Above Advisory from the CDC</h3>
<p>Dear Students,<br/><br/>Because of the increasing reports of confirmed COVID-19 cases in several foreign countries, HPU has instituted a new requirement for all faculty, staff, and students who have visited (within the last 14 days) or are planning to visit any country with a <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/index.html">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) level 2 or higher travel advisory</a> for COVID-19 transmission: YOU MUST ADVISE THE UNIVERSITY OF YOUR TRAVEL PRIOR TO RETURNING TO CAMPUS, AND MAY NOT RETURN TO CAMPUS UNLESS APPROVED TO DO SO BY THE UNIVERSITY. These countries and regions currently include China (level 3), Japan (level 2), Italy (level 3), South Korea (level 3), and Iran (level 3). HPU&#8217;s decision to require this notification follows the CDC workplace-related exposure guidelines. Please contact our Director of the Office of International Student and Scholars Bernard Chong, iss@hpu.edu or 808-544-1480, in advance of returning to HPU, informing him of your recent past travel or future travel plans.<br/><br/>While it is important to note there are no cases of COVID-19 in Hawai&#8216;i and the state does have testing capabilities, HPU continues to monitor federal-level reports on COVID-19. HPU also follows the latest directives and updates from key state and local sources and the WASC Senior College and University Commission, our accrediting body. We will carefully consider the Hawai&#8216;i Department of Health guidance for schools and universities to determine any operational changes for HPU. Over the past several weeks, teams of faculty and staff have developed policies, procedures, and plans to ensure the health and safety of our community.<br/><br/>Please practice the simple steps we can all follow to help minimize the spread of germs and sickness, including colds and the flu:<br/><br/>&#8226; Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after using the restroom, before eating, and after blowing your nose, coughing or sneezing, and if your hands are visibly dirty. If soap and water are not readily available, use a hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol.<br/><br/>&#8226; Clean frequently touched surfaces and objects daily e.g., tables, countertops, light switches, doorknobs, and cabinet handles, using cleaning agents normally used in these areas.<br/><br/>&#8226; Stay home if you are sick with flu-like symptoms, such as a fever and a cough and notify your professors and workplace supervisor of your status.<br/><br/>In addition to concerns for our physical health, we recognize COVID-19 has created psychological and emotional distress for many of us. The HPU Counseling and Behavioral Health Center staff is available to help and support you with trained and licensed psychologists and therapists. Please call 808-687-7076 for an appointment.<br/><br/>We ask for your cooperation to stay alert of the rapidly evolving COVID-19 situation but to avoid over-alarm. We will continue to keep you updated about ongoing efforts to provide a healthy and safe environment for our HPU &#8216;ohana.</p>

<h3>WEDNESDAY, FEB. 26, 2020<br/>Spring Break: Travel Advisory</h3>
<p>Aloha Students,</p>
<p>While there are no reported cases of the coronavirus (COVID-19) in Hawai&#8216;i, the University continues to monitor government health agencies&#8217; directives about the spread of the virus and potential impacts on University operations.</p>
<p>As you prepare for spring break and then the rest of the semester, please keep in mind the following if you are traveling:&#160;</p>
<ul>
<li>You should not travel to mainland China. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has issued a Level 3 warning to avoid all nonessential travel to mainland China. See all government travel advisories at<a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel"> this website</a>.&#160;</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The countries or regions you might be planning to visit could implement restrictions with no notice, even while you are outside of the U.S. Flight cancellations, quarantine, and restricted re-entry into the U.S. are all possibilities that you should consider if you travel to one of these countries or regions.&#160;</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Restrictions may escalate from current advisories. The other countries or regions on the government list of advisories and warnings include Hong Kong, Iran, Italy, Japan, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand and Vietnam.&#160;</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Consider purchasing travel insurance in case of a disruption to your plans.&#160;</li>
</ul>
<p>If you have any questions about foreign travel, please feel free to contact the HPU <a href="https://www.hpu.edu/oiss/index.html">Office of International Students and Scholars</a> (808-356-5299 or <a href="mailto:iss@hpu.edu">iss@hpu.edu</a>) Our staff there will help you, even with concerns about personal travel, and it&#8217;s a good idea to let them know of your plans in case the University can help with any problems you might encounter while traveling.&#160;</p>
<p>Our residence halls and dining will remain open during spring break.&#160;</p>
<p>And, one final bit of advice:&#160;talk with your families about the daily news, be sure they know how you&#8217;re doing, and continue to let us know of your questions and concerns.</p>
<p>Mahalo,</p>
<p>Marites McKee<br/>Dean of Students<br/><br/></p>

<h3>FRIDAY, JAN. 31, 2020<br/>Summary of an update to Students, Faculty, Staff</h3>
<p>While there are no reported cases of the coronavirus in Hawai&#8216;i, the University continues to monitor government health agencies&#8217; directives about the spread of this novel (new) respiratory virus.</p>
<p>Earlier today, the United States declared the coronavirus a public health emergency, while noting that the risk of infection for Americans is currently low and this and other actions are designed to keep that risk low. The<a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/China.html"> State Department</a> has issued a Level 4 alert, warning not to travel to China. The<a href="https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019"> World Health Organization</a> and the<a href="https://health.hawaii.gov/docd/advisories/novel-coronavirus-2019/"> Hawai&#8216;i Department of Health</a> websites provide public health information and guidance.</p>
<p>As it is flu season, individuals are asked to follow standard health precautions to avoid the spread of illness, including the washing of hands regularly. If people are sick with flu-like symptoms such as fever or a cough, please do not come to work or school, and if needed, a doctor&#8217;s note will validate absences.</p>
<p>As a health-care resource for students, the University offers a third-party provider health clinic on campus at Aloha Tower Marketplace. The campus health clinic does administer the flu vaccination, charging a fee for this service. HPU will be scheduling a day in the coming weeks where we administer the flu shots without charge for students living in university housing. Further details on this will be forthcoming. For details and hours of operation of the student health clinic, and additional health-care resources, click<a href="https://www.hpu.edu/health-services/hospitals-clinics.html"> here</a>. HPU will likewise host an on-site flu shot clinic for full-time faculty and staff in a Downtown campus location. More details will be forwarded on a later date.</p>
<p>Key facts to consider:</p>
<ul>
<li>There are no cases of the coronavirus in Hawai&#8216;i.</li>
<li>There are no HPU study abroad or other university-sponsored programs in China.</li>
<li>HPU has suspended university-sponsored travel to China.&#160;</li>
<li>Honolulu is 5,356 miles away from Wuhan, China; comparatively, New York is 4,957 miles from Honolulu.</li>
<li>As a precaution, the Honolulu airport is among the 20 large international airports nationwide with CDC coronavirus screening on site.&#160;</li>
</ul>
<hr/><hr/>
<h3>MONDAY, JAN. 27, 2020&#160;<br/>Summary of an update to Students, Faculty, Staff</h3>
<p>With news each day of the spread of the new respiratory virus, coronavirus, the University is monitoring the situation and will continue to stay on top of advice and directives from the federal, state, and local levels. Among the sites HPU is watching for updates are the<a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/traveladvisories/traveladvisories.html/"> State Department</a>,<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/index.html"> CDC</a>, and the<a href="https://health.hawaii.gov/"> Hawai&#8216;i Department of Health</a>.&#160;</p>
<p>The U.S. Centers for Disease Control have issued a Level 3 alert, meaning travel directly to Wuhan is to be avoided. Also, the U.S. State Department has issued a Level 2 alert, meaning increased caution should be exercised with any consideration of travel to China.</p>
<p>There are no reported cases of coronavirus in Hawai&#8216;i. Still, HPU remains diligent and proactive as it watches the spread of this illness.</p>
<p>There are no HPU study abroad programs in China or other university-sponsored travel programs in China at this time. University-sponsored travel to Wuhan is prohibited, and HPU will approve limited travel to other regions of China on a case-by-case basis.</p>
