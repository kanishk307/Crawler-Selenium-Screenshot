		<p><strong>Longwood has moved classes and assignments to a fully online format through the end of the semester, including exams.</strong> Students should continue coursework and work with professors directly about this transition.</p>
<p>On April 16, President Reveley <a href="/news/2020/longwood-announces-leadership-team/">announced a cross-university team of university leaders and experts</a> to look at all aspects of campus life to help prepare Longwood to safely re-open for in-person learning in the upcoming fall semester.&nbsp;Reveley and&nbsp;Hampden-Sydney President Larry Stimpert underscored this focus in an <a href="/news/2020/why-our-colleges-can-and-must-reopen-this-fall/">April 27 op-ed in the Richmond Times-Dispatch</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Longwood’s campus is only open to students with extenuating circumstances. </strong>Students have been instructed to return home for the remainder of the semester.</p>
<p><strong>Commencement will be held Oct. 9 and 10. </strong>We’ll announce more details in the weeks ahead.</p>

<h3>Academics</h3>
<p class="question">Are classes still meeting?</p>
<p>Longwood has moved classes and assignments to a fully online format through the end of the semester, including exams. Professors are working with students to deliver classes in a fully online format. For details about individual classes and assignments, contact your professor.</p>
<p class="question">What can I expect from online classes?</p>
<p>Just because you are working online, you are still in school and will be required to complete assigned work by set deadlines. Professors are working to deliver class content to students through a variety of methods and working with students to navigate any issues faced with online learning.</p>
<p>Depending on the way your faculty organize their online classes, you:</p>
<ul>
<li>may be required to be online with your class, small groups, or your instructor at the same time (also called synchronous instruction).</li>
<li>will still be required to submit assignments by required due dates.</li>
<li>will be required to stay up-to-date on coursework, rather than being able to work whenever you want.</li>
</ul>
<p class="question">How much time should I be spending on my classes?</p>
<p>In a typical in-person class, for every hour you spend in class, you should be spending another two hours outside of class on work. With a move to online instruction, the total amount of expected work should remain the same, but the types of interaction will be different. Your instructors will determine how class meeting times will be changed in the online environment so that the total amount of time spent on the class remains the same.</p>
<p class="question">Where do I find my coursework?</p>
<p>Your professor will be in touch with you on how to access coursework. Most content will be available on your course’s Canvas site. If you have not been in touch with your instructor and do not see your class in Canvas, please contact your instructor immediately.</p>
<p class="question">I’m having issues with my online classes. What should I do?</p>
<p>First, talk to your professor. We understand that everyone is in a different situation right now, and we’re here to help. Whether it’s lack of reliable internet, lack of access to equipment, or any other issue, we want to provide the support you need to successfully complete this semester. The Digital Education Collaborative office (434-395-4332 or <a href="mailto:dec@longwood.edu">dec@longwood.edu</a>) and Help Desk (434-395-4357 or <a href="mailto:helpdesk@longwood.edu">helpdesk@longwood.edu</a>) are good starting points for helping navigate some of these issues.</p>
<p>There are a few strategies for dealing with spotty internet access that may help:</p>
<ul>
<li>If they offer recordings of their live sessions, ask if you are allowed to watch those at a later time. This will take less bandwidth.</li>
<li>When using any web conferencing software, it is good to consider that it takes less bandwidth to receive video than to send it. One suggestion is to not send your own video, mute your camera and only your name or the photo connected to your profile will show.</li>
<li>Try to not watch the sessions live, but to watch the recording of the class later, if this is offered. This requires less bandwidth as well.</li>
<li>Attend live sessions via cellphone using the appropriate app.</li>
</ul>
<p class="question">What if I need a specific piece of equipment like a laptop to participate in my coursework, but I don’t have it?</p>
<p>We can help. You can check out a laptop from the Digital Education Collaborative or Greenwood Library. iPads are available from the DEC as well. We have a limited supply of webcams, but have ordered more that will be available soon.</p>
<p>Both the DEC and the Greenwood Library have other equipment you may need. Contact the DEC at&nbsp;<a href="mailto:dec@longwood.edu">dec@longwood.edu</a> or 434-395-4332. Contact the library at&nbsp;<a href="mailto:ask@longwood.libanswers.com">ask@longwood.libanswers.com</a> or 434-395-2433.</p>
<p class="question">What if I have questions about accommodations related to my documented disability?</p>
<p>The Office of Disability Resources is open from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. every day. To contact them, call 434-395-2391, email <a href="mailto:disabilityresources@longwood.edu">disabilityresources@longwood.edu</a>, or get in touch with director Dana Miller-Kieran at <a href="mailto:millerkierandm@longwood.edu">millerkierandm@longwood.edu</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="question">Can I still get help from the Writing Center or the Quantitative Reasoning Center?</p>
<p>The Writing Center is conducting virtual sessions. You can sign up for a virtual appointment at <a href="https://longwood.mywconline.com/">https://longwood.mywconline.com/</a>. The Quantitative Reasoning Center has virtual tutoring hours using Zoom. Updated information about this is on their blog at <a href="https://blogs.longwood.edu/qrcenter/">https://blogs.longwood.edu/qrcenter/</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="question">Is the IT Help Desk still open?</p>
<p>The Help Desk is open and ready to help you with issues like passwords, Lancer Net, or hardware and software questions. Visit their <a href="http://www.longwood.edu/usersupport/">website</a>&nbsp;or call 434-395-4357.</p>
<p class="question">Can I still use all the library resources and get help from a librarian?</p>
<p>The <a href="https://libguides.longwood.edu/">Greenwood Library</a> remains open and has librarians on call to help you.&nbsp;Please see <a href="#campusoperations">amended hours below</a>.</p>
<p class="question">What is the DEC?</p>
<p>The <a href="/dec/">Digital Education Collaborative (DEC)</a> is an office on campus that supports distance and online instruction for both students and faculty.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="question">What if I don’t see the Canvas site for my course?</p>
<p>Contact your instructor first to ensure the course is published. If the course is published and you still can’t see it, or if you are unable to get in touch with your instructor, please reach out to the DEC at&nbsp;<a href="mailto:dec@longwood.edu">dec@longwood.edu</a> or 434-395-4332.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="question">What is Zoom, and do I need it?</p>
<p>Zoom is a video conferencing tool that allows groups of people to meet in real-time. Faculty may meet with their class using Zoom or another video conferencing tool like WebEx or Canvas Conferences.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p class="question">How do I join a Zoom meeting?</p>
<p>In most cases, joining a Zoom meeting is as easy as clicking a link on your computer or dialing a phone number, both of which would have been sent to you by the host (your instructor). We recommend you download the Zoom app, which is free for Android and iOS.</p>
<p class="question">Do I need a Zoom account to join a Zoom meeting?</p>
<p>No, students don’t need accounts and don’t need to download additional programs. <a href="https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/201362193-Joining-a-Meeting">Learn more about joining a Zoom meeting</a>.

<p class="question">What is Panopto, and do I need it?</p>
<p>Panopto is a screen recording and presentation software that faculty and students can use to present information and give course examples not in real-time. You can use Panopto to record voice over PowerPoints or share examples on your computer desktop. If your instructor has assigned you to complete a Panopto recording, you should see a link to Panopto in the left hand navigation menu on Canvas.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="question">What is Honorlock?</p>
<p>Honorlock is a test integrity system that provides cheating deterrents for online tests, quizzes and assignments through identity verification, a browser guard, proctoring, mobile device detection, and seek and destroy technology for similar questions on the web. Your Honorlock experience may be different from one class to another or even one quiz to another. Be sure to read the instructions provided by your instructor.

<h3><a name="grading"></a>Grading</h3>
<p class="question">What are the grading options for undergraduate courses that moved online for the spring 2020 semester?</p>
<p>There are two options.&nbsp; Students can choose to remain with the standard A-F grading scale.&nbsp; Students also have the option to choose an alternate pass/fail scale for any of their current undergraduate spring courses that were moved online because of COVID-19. This scale awards students the grades:</p>
<ul>
<li>PV (C- and better)</li>
<li>DV (D+, D, D-)</li>
<li>FV (failing)</li>
</ul>
<p class="question">Will all spring classes automatically switch to the alternate pass/fail grading scale?</p>
<p>No. You must choose which classes you want graded on the alternate pass/fail scale.</p>
<p class="question">What are some reasons I might want to choose the alternate pass/fail grading scale?</p>
<p>Reasons will vary based on personal situations.&nbsp; If you are concerned that you don’t learn as well with distance learning as you would with face-to-face learning, particularly in a certain course, or if you have limited access to the internet, or if new family or work obligations now take up a significant amount of time, this may be an option to consider.</p>
<p class="question">What are some reasons I might NOT want to choose the alternate pass/fail grading scale?</p>
<p>You may want to keep the standard A-F grading scale if you have program or course requirements that are higher than a C-.&nbsp; If you are considering graduate school or if your financial aid requires a certain number of graded credit hours, you may want to keep the standard A-F grading scale.&nbsp; You may also want to keep the A-F grading scale because you want those courses in your GPA, or for other personal reasons.</p>
<p class="question">How should I decide if it makes sense for me to choose the alternate pass/fail grading scale for any of my courses?</p>
<p>You should consult with your academic advisor. For example, if you are in a program that requires grades above a C-, your advisor can help explain whether it is feasible for you to take those courses with the alternate pass/fail grading scale and whether they will count for future coursework.</p>
<p class="question">If I choose to take the alternate pass/fail grading option for a class, does that lock in my current grade?</p>
<p>No. You are expected to finish your assigned work for the semester in all courses, and your course grade will be based on the entire semester’s work.</p>
<p class="question">Will choosing this option for a class affect my financial aid?</p>
<p>If you are receiving financial aid, you should consult with financial aid staff about what effect, if any, either withdrawing or choosing the alternate pass/fail grading option may have.</p>
<p class="question">Is there a limit to how many courses I can choose to be graded on the alternate pass/fail scale?</p>
<p>No, you may choose any number or all of your classes to be graded on the alternate pass/fail scale.</p>
<p class="question">I’m a student athlete. Will choosing the alternate pass/fail grading scale affect my eligibility?</p>
<p>You should consult with athletics academic support staff about how your decisions could affect eligibility or aid.</p>
<p class="question">When is the deadline to make this decision?</p>
<p>You should weigh your options carefully and in close consultation with your academic advisor, based on your major or minor program requirements and future plans. Many pre-professional programs and graduate schools in particular will want to see the usual A-F grades. This is not a decision to rush into, which is why you have several weeks to think about it and consult with faculty and staff. The deadline to opt into the alternate pass/fail grading scale with your advisor’s sign-off is Friday, April 24 at 5 p.m.</p>
<p class="question">I want to have a class graded on the alternate pass/fail grading scale. What do I need to do?</p>
<p>You must fill out a pdf form (available on the Registrar&rsquo;s site) and submit it to your academic advisor. Your academic advisor will grant approval electronically and submit the form for you. This process must be completed by 5 p.m. on Friday, April 24.</p>
<p class="question">If I want my classes to continue to be graded on the typical A-F scale, what do I need to do?</p>
<p>Nothing. If you don’t choose the alternate option, your classes will continue to be graded on the typical A-F scale.</p>
<p class="question">How will this affect my GPA?</p>
<ul>
<li>If you took intersession courses, those are still factored into your Spring 2020 semester GPA.</li>
<li>Any courses that you choose to leave graded in the typical A-F scale will be factored into your Spring 2020 semester GPA.</li>
<li>If you choose a class to be graded in the alternate pass/fail scale, it will not be factored into your Spring 2020 semester GPA.</li>
</ul>
<p class="question">Do all courses have this option?</p>
<p>The alternate pass/fail grading scale is only available for undergraduate classes that began as a face-to-face class and moved fully online because of COVID-19.</p>
<p class="question">If I choose this option for one or some of my classes, can I still make the Dean’s or President’s List?</p>
<p>The President’s and Dean’s Lists recognize students based on the semester’s GPA.</p>
<ul>
<li>To be on the President’s List, a student must have completed at least 12 semester hours and earned a 4.0 for those hours.</li>
<li>To be on the Dean’s List, a student must have completed at least 12 semester hours and earned between a 3.5 and 3.999 for those hours and have no grades below C-.</li>
</ul>
<p>Students who change one or more courses to the alternate pass/fail grading option should be aware of the possibility that they would not be eligible for either list because those grades would not be factored into the semester GPA.</p>
<p class="question">If I am on probation now or have been readmitted after suspension, will choosing the Pass/Fail option affect my standing?</p>
<p>Students currently on academic probation or who have been readmitted after suspension and who convert all courses to the alternate pass/fail grading scale must earn no more than one grade of DV or FV to be in good standing for the semester.</p>
<p class="question">Will the alternate pass/fail grading scale help me avoid academic probation or suspension?</p>
<p>Probation and suspension may still occur during the spring semester and will follow the same definitions. Students currently in good standing who decide to change all courses to the alternate pass/fail grading scale and who receive all FVs will be placed on academic probation for the next semester.</p>
<p class="question">When is the final day of undergraduate classes?</p>
<p>Wednesday, April 29.</p>
<p class="question">When do final exams begin?</p>
<p>Friday, May 1.<br><br></p>
<h3><a name="residencelife"></a>Residence Life</h3>
<p class="question">Can I stay in my Longwood housing?</p>
<p>We have required all students to move out of on-campus or Longwood-managed off-campus housing by Friday, March 27.</p>
<p class="question">I am unable to return home. What do I need to do to be able to stay in Longwood housing this semester?</p>

If you have other circumstances, please email <a href="mailto:questions@longwood.edu">questions@longwood.edu</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="question">Will I be refunded for my parking pass?</p>
<p>If you are a continuing student with a valid parking pass for the Spring 2020 semester, you will have a $50 credit applied to your account in July. If you are graduating and had a valid parking pass for the Spring 2020 semester, your July refund check will increase by $50. If you have remaining charges on your student account, they will be deducted from the July refund. If you have questions, please email <a href="mailto:questions@longwood.edu">questions@longwood.edu</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="question">I’m feeling sick. What should I do?</p>
<p>This is the time of year many people become ill from the flu or other seasonal viruses. The CDC lists&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/about/symptoms.html">symptoms of coronavirus</a>&nbsp;as cough, fever, and shortness of breath. If you have these symptoms, you should call the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.longwood.edu/health/">University Health Center</a>&nbsp;at 434-395-2102 and they can help you assess whether you need treatment or rest.</p>
<p>The University Health Center is open from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m., Monday-Friday. If you have a medical issue outside these hours, follow the guidance outlined on the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.longwood.edu/health/">University Health Center website</a>.</p>

<h3><a name="caresact"></a>CARES Act</h3>
<p class="question">Who will receive a CARES Act grant?</p>
<p>All Longwood undergraduate students who had a valid FAFSA on file before April 30 and have incurred some expense related to Covid-19 will receive a CARES Act grant. Each student will receive a grant of $618.87. Those funds will be either direct-deposited or mailed by check by June 1.</p>
<p class="question">How much money was distributed to students?</p>
<p>Longwood received $1,610,289 from the CARES Act to support students, every penny of which was distributed to students.</p>
<p class="question">How was the grant amount determined?</p>
<p>The CARES Act earmarked a portion of the funding provided to each university for student relief. Longwood divided that money evenly among students who met both federal and institutional eligibility requirements.</p>
<p class="question">When will the money be in my account?</p>
<p>If you will receive a CARES Act grant and you have direct deposit set up, the money will be deposited into your account by June 1. If you do not have direct deposit, you may set it up by May 19 in order for the money to be directly deposited in your account. If you don’t have direct deposit, you will receive a check that will be mailed by June 1.</p>
<p class="question">Do I have to prove that I had expenses related to Covid-19 to receive the funds?</p>
<p>The CARES Act grant is for students who have had expenses related to the disruption of campus operations due to coronavirus--this includes housing and dining plans, travel expenses, technology, or additional food expenses. The University will not request proof of these expenses. Instead, by accepting the funding you confirm you had an extra expense.</p>
<p class="question">Is the grant money taxable?</p>
<p>No, the grant is not includible in your gross income.</p>

<h2><a name="facultystaff"></a>Information for Faculty &amp; Staff</h2>
<p class="question">What does this latest announcement on March 19 about classes going online for the remainder of the semester mean for employees?</p>
<p>The guidance regarding telework, leave and other matters given last week when in-person classes moved to fully-online continues to apply. The University will be in further communication with employees next week.</p>
<p class="question">Should faculty and staff continue reporting to work?</p>
<p>We are committed to keeping our campus open for students who need to stay, and the vice presidents are working closely with employees to do so.</p>
<p>However, pursuant to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.governor.virginia.gov/newsroom/all-releases/2020/march/headline-853537-en.html">guidance issued by Gov. Northam</a> for state agencies to encourage telework, we are directing vice presidents to work with staff to determine eligibility and ability to telework.</p>
<p class="question">Who determines if I’m eligible for telework?</p>
<p>The vice president in your area will determine which employees are eligible for telework.</p>
<p class="question">My job can be accomplished via telework but I have limited or no access to the internet at home. What should I do?</p>
<p>Guidance will be provided by the Vice President of your area.</p>
<p class="question">My job can be done via telework, but I want to continue to work from campus. Is that acceptable?</p>
<p>The governor’s office is encouraging those who can telework to do so. The campus remains open, however, and faculty and staff have access to their work spaces.</p>
<p class="question">My job can be accomplished via telework but I don’t have a work laptop? What should I do?</p>
<p>Guidance will be provided by the Vice President of your area.&nbsp;Please work with your supervisor to ensure you have access to the resources you need.</p>
<p class="question">I am in a group deemed high risk by the CDC and cannot telework, what do I do?</p>
<p>Contact HR at <a href="mailto:hrCovid19@longwood.edu">hrCovid19@longwood.edu</a>.</p>
<p class="question">My job cannot be done via telework and I have health concerns about coming onto campus. What do I do?</p>
<p>Contact HR at&nbsp;<a href="mailto:hrCovid19@longwood.edu">hrCovid19@longwood.edu</a>.</p>
<p class="question">My job cannot be done via telework but I don’t have childcare. What do I do?</p>
<p>Contact HR at&nbsp;<a href="mailto:hrCovid19@longwood.edu">hrCovid19@longwood.edu</a>.</p>
<p class="question">On campus, what does social distancing mean for faculty and staff?</p>
<p>You are encouraged to meet by phone or teleconferencing as possible.</p>
<p>Governor Northam is directing state agencies, through the Department of Human Resource Management, to limit in-person meetings and non-essential, work-related gatherings.</p>
<p class="question">I supervise student workers. Do I need to be on campus if they want to work?</p>
<p>Because classes are fully online for the remainder of the semester, we have advised student workers that they should not report for work.</p>
<p class="question">How do I work with students to send forms to the Registrar's Office?</p>
<p>In order to be responsive to Longwood’s current operating plan the Registrar’s Office will be accepting forms via email. The following process needs to be followed:</p>
<ul>
<li>Students have been instructed to fill out forms completely. Most are fillable forms and can be saved to their computer.</li>
<li>If the form requires signatures from an advisor or department chair, the student will send the form to the appropriate signer (advisor or department chair) via their live.longwood.edu email for approval. The advisor or department chair will then be responsible for sending their approval with the completed form to <a href="mailto:registrar@longwood.edu">registrar@longwood.edu</a>.</li>
<li>Please be aware some forms may need a secondary approval. For example if the student has a minor, the Application for Degree will need the advisor’s signature as well as the department chair’s signature for the minor. In these cases, after the first approval is obtained that advisor or department chair will need to send it to the next approver. Once all applicable approvals are obtained, the form and all email approvals need to be emailed to <a href="mailto:registrar@longwood.edu">registrar@longwood.edu</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Please let us know if you have any questions regarding this process at <a href="mailto:registrar@longwood.edu">registrar@longwood.edu</a>.​</p>
<p class="question">Are midterm grading estimates still due at the same time?</p>
