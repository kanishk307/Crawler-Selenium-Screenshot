<p>Sul Ross will maintain this page to answer frequently asked questions and provide the most up-to-date information and guidance.</p>
<p>University business must continue as we still have essential tasks to complete.Â  Supervisors should be flexible with work schedules and leave for the remainder of the 2020 spring semester and practice social distancing within offices.Â  The University is closed to the public beginning March 17 but will still allow some employees to work on campus to ensure access to necessary equipment and technology.Â  All University buildings are closed to the public and only authorized personnel will have access. Supervisors will analyze job functions to determine whether some jobs may be performed remotely. For offices whose staff are working remotely, please make sure to forward your office calls to the appropriate cell number or plan to check your messages frequently.</p>
<p>The following are frequently asked questions from faculty, staff, and students.Â  If you have additional questions specific to your department or division, please contact your supervisor or division head.</p>
<p>If you have a question about SRSUâs response to the COVID-19 outbreak, we want to hear them.Â  You can submit your questions through this form:</p>

Other than essential employees, all Sul Ross faculty and staff should continue to work remotely, for now. During this extended closure, divisions heads and supervisors will work on plans to bring employees back to campus.</p>
<p><strong>Phase II</strong>Â âÂ <strong><em>Emergency Operations</em>Â will end on June 1</strong>Â <strong>and the University will initiate a return-to-campus process.</strong>Â At this time, employees not approved for working remotely will begin to physically return to campus for regular business operations. Employees working under a telecommute agreement may continue to work remotely unless otherwise instructed by supervisors. Some university buildings will be open to the public or will allow for authorized visitors only. Offices will limit the number of visitors permitted, to practice social distancing. Division heads and supervisors will develop protocols that address the number of visitors that offices may safely admit.</p>
<p><strong>Phase III</strong>Â âÂ <strong>On July 1, the University will enter its final phase and will begin ânormalâ operations.</strong>Â All buildings will be open to the public and the majority of university employees will return to campus for regular business operations. Division heads and supervisors will remain in close contact to monitor safe working conditions.</p>

You may visit with your supervisor to determine if a building key can be issued to you.  While working on campus, you should have your office door closed and locked with a sign indicating that the office is closed to visitors and contact numbers to reach office staff in that department.  Again, the building will be closed to the public, but other employees working in the building may need to reach other departments for assistance.</p>

Supervisors in collaboration with division heads are reviewing essential business operations that must continue during this unprecedented time. Some employees may work on campus with little to no physical public engagement to promote social distancing. Some employees will work remotely based on their job duties. Others will receive emergency leave due to the nature of their positions that do not allow work from home. The Universityâs goal is to follow CDC guidelines and limit large number of employees from returning to campus. Additionally, supervisors are asked to use video or teleconferencing to engage with employees as needed.

<p>At Sul Ross this means that the President is authorized to allow emergency leave until further notice while we actively work to find solutions to continue our higher education mission. We will continue to monitor the actions by the state of Texas and provide new information as it becomes available. Our primary goal continues to be that our employees are paid on time and do not use personal leave at this time.</p>

policy.\u00a0 Effective March 6, 2020, the list serve mentioned above will only be used for messages by university offices to send communications necessary for normal business operations.\u00a0 These

Some offices require specific equipment or technology that will require certain employees to work from campus.  Those offices should practice social distancing and take all precautions to keep unauthorized personnel out of the workplace.  Some employees will be eligible to work remotely and in consultation with supervisors will be given appropriate and available equipment to perform work remotely.  University employees will have access to buildings but most doors will be locked to the public.  If you do not have a key to enter the building, you may need to call UDPS or SWTJC PD for assistance.  You may visit with your supervisor to determine if a building key can be issued to you.  While working on campus, you should have your office door closed and locked with a sign indicating that the office is closed to visitors and contact numbers to reach office staff in that department.  Again, the building will be closed to the public, but other employees working in the building may need to reach other departments for assistance.<\/p>\n"}},{"@type":"Question","name":"How is the University promoting remote work?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"<p>Supervisors are strongly encouraged to show flexibility with work schedules including but not limited to flexible hours and when needed offer remote work from home and support for employees with children or elderly family members at home. Supervisors in collaboration with division heads are reviewing essential business operations that must continue during this unprecedented time. Some employees may work on campus with little to no physical public engagement to promote social distancing. Some employees will work remotely based on their job duties. Others will receive emergency leave due to the nature of their positions that do not allow work from home. The University\u2019s goal is to follow CDC guidelines and limit large number of employees from returning to campus. Additionally, supervisors are asked to use video or teleconferencing to engage with employees as needed.
