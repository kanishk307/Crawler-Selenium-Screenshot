                        <p>After months of remote academic instruction and institutional operation, teams of
                           students, faculty and staff have worked to develop a comprehensive plan to prepare
                           East Stroudsburg University for your return to a COVID-ready environment. Remember
                           that you play a vital role in making the fall semester a positive experience for all
                           on campus!
                        </p>
                        
                        
                        <p>East Stroudsburg University has made a significant financial and personnel investment
                           in the development of a plan intended to keep everyone in our campus community safe,
                           healthy, and engaged as we continue to battle the invisible yet dangerous pandemic.
                           Two specific campus teams that are guiding our efforts are the Academic Continuity
                           Team (ACT), led by our Provost, Joanne Z. Bruno, J.D., and the Integration and Communication
                           Task Force, led by ESU’s Director of Environmental Health and Safety, Nathan Black.
                           Together, these groups comprised of students, staff representing AFSCME, SCUPA and
                           managers, administrators and faculty representing APSCUF, UWCC, Senate and Chair’s
                           Council, have developed plans to re-open ESU that are now available to you for review
                           below.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>The guide is a fluid document and follows guidelines from the Centers for Disease
                           Control (CDC), the Pennsylvania Department of Health (DOH), the Pennsylvania Department
                           of Education (PDE) and the Pennsylvania State System of Higher Education (PASSHE).
                           Please be sure that you visit the site from time to time for updates. While the Guide
                           focuses on our return to campus, the document also includes contingency planning should
                           we be forced to return to fully remote instruction and services. For now, here is
                           a snapshot of what you can expect when you arrive on campus:
                        </p>
                        
                        <ul>
                           
                           <li>Moving In - Students scheduled to move into ESU’s residence hall will do so during
                              the week of August 24. Instructions on how our staff will conduct move-in will be
                              shared with you in early August. Classes will begin on Monday, August 31 at 8 a.m.
                              We intend to follow our current academic calendar for Fall 2020 but are prepared to
                              change academic instruction quickly if necessary.
                           </li>
                           
                           <li>Pathways to Learning - Courses will be delivered in a variety of ways we are calling
                              “Flex Fall,” which will enable faculty to adapt their fall course delivery to include
                              hybrid delivery (some face-to-face combined with online instruction) as well as preparing
                              for a fully remote delivery in the case of large classes (excess of 60 students) and
                              for contingency purposes. Face-to-face instruction will look different. Additional
                              details are shared in the Guide.
                           </li>
                           
                           <li>Dining Options - Dining areas are being reconfigured to allow distancing during on-site
                              dining. There will also be to-go options available.
                           </li>
                           
                           <li>Masks and Social Distancing - Students, faculty and staff will be required to wear
                              a mask and maintain social distancing in the classrooms, common areas, and public
                              spaces to the extent possible. An ESU mask will be issued to every employee and student
                              at the start of the fall semester.
                           </li>
                           
                           <li>Staying Healthy - Cleaning of all public spaces and common areas will be addressed
                              periodically throughout the day to keep everyone safe. Hand sanitizing stations and
                              plastic shielding will be installed in key academic areas and offices around campus,
                              and appropriate signage is in place to remind everyone of traffic flow and other guidelines
                              within all buildings. If anyone within our campus community presents with COVID symptoms,
                              they will need to be tested immediately. Plans are in place to quarantine those who
                              test positive and we are also investigating ways to do contact tracing.
                           </li>
                           
                        </ul>
                        
                        <p>To be successful this fall, it will be critical that ALL members of our campus community
                           – students, faculty, and staff – continue to follow CDC guidelines to: wear a mask;
                           maintain a social distance of six feet whenever possible, and clean all high-touch
                           areas that you come in contact with on a regular basis.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>Policies and procedures for those who do not adhere to University health and safety
                           requirements associated with COVID will be in place to ensure we keep our campus,
                           our community and one another safe.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>Lastly, as announced at the start of the spring semester, I’ll be retiring as your
                           president effective July 31, 2020, but I leave the campus and your future in the trusted
                           hands of Interim President Ken Long and other members of ESU’s senior leadership team.
                           I hope that all of you will continue to enjoy these beautiful summer days and come
                           back to ESU this fall ready to face any challenge that comes your way.
                        </p>

                     supply two reusable, washable cloth face masks to every student and employee. If you
                     already have masks you are encouraged to continue to use them, and be sure to follow
                     the CDC guidance on washing and sanitizing masks. Additional masks will be available

                     halls, such as Abelloff and Beers, will be reduced to 30% of normal capacity to allow
                     for distancing yet allowing larger classes to have in-person instruction. A reduction
                     in the frequency of in-person class meetings and implementing blended course delivery

                              <p>As experiential learning assignments are specific to one’s major, it is important
                                 for students to remain in close contact with their academic advisor, department chairperson,
                                 and college dean. It is anticipated that as we are in the Commonwealth’s Green Phase,
                                 experiential learning, including internships, externships, clinicals, labs, etc. will
                                 be able to continue face-to-face through the fall 2020 semester as long as social-distancing
                                 and masking are observed.

                                 In order to provide a smooth transition to campus, we will have sign-up times for
                                 students to move into their assigned on-campus residential facility from August 26
                                 to August 28 for new students, and from August 26 through August 30 for continuing
                                 students. This will allow for social distancing and additional cleaning protocols
                                 to occur.&nbsp; You will receive information by July 13 regarding move-in details via email,
