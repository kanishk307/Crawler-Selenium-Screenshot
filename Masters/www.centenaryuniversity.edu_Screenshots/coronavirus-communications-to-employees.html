<p>Dear Colleagues,</p>
<p>Humans are built for socializing.  Research (mostly from cell phone data) is showing that many are starting to experience “social distancing fatigue”.  The golf courses and parks open as of Saturday (whewhoo) will certainly be crowded.  Stay safe, keep sanitizing, and wash hands often.</p>

<p><strong>April 28, 2020: Email from President Murphy to all faculty and staff:</strong></p>
<p>To our Cyclone Strong community,</p>
<p>We all have a role, and a responsibility, in ensuring the health of Centenary University. Our exemplary educational experience is enhanced by fostering students that align with Centenary’s mission, especially those from different backgrounds. This has been a financial stress for many in our community. Fortunately, Centenary qualified for the Small Business Administration Payroll Protection Plan which will help us in the future. Additionally, Centenary is a beneficiary of the CARES Act that Congress of the United States passed. This means that Centenary is going to be able to make emergency funds available to our students. On top of these plans Centenary is also making credit adjustments for room and board.</p>
<p>COVID19 has altered everything we do in our daily life. Centenary’s faculty, staff and administration have responded with commendable, amazing enthusiasm to enable our students to finish this semester with the progress they anticipated and more importantly for our seniors, graduation! I hope you will join us for our Virtual Commencement on May 9.</p>
<p>As we move beyond Commencement, I want you to know that Centenary University has plans of reopening our campus by the customary August start dates with what new rules and practices that are deemed necessary by our Governor.  We will have alternate plans in place for a scenario in which much or all learning will be conducted remotely if that is the directive from the Governor.</p>
<p>Please visit our <a href="https://www.centenaryuniversity.edu/coronavirus-communications/">Latest Updates</a> for more information.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Dr. Bruce Murphy<br />
<em>President</em></p>

<p><strong>April 22, 2020: Email from VP Kerry Mullins to all students:</strong></p>
<p>Dear Cyclones,</p>
<p>As Governor Murphy said recently; we are here for each other by not being near each other. We in Student Life want you to know that we are here for you despite not being near you.</p>
<p>First I want to say thank you to you and your families. None of us anticipated this would be the conclusion to our 2019-2020 academic year. I am so impressed by your resilience during these uncertain times. I am moved by the way our student leaders and faculty and staff have stepped up to assist their fellow cyclones and serve others.</p>
<p>Secondly, I want to share some updates as we work to successfully celebrate your accomplishments, conclude our academic year, and start looking ahead to next year.</p>
<p>We are pleased to announce some virtual year end celebrations:</p>
<ul>
<li>Virtual leadership awards- Student Life is excited to announce that we will be hosting this year’s annual Leadership Award Ceremony virtually!

<li>Work is underway to assist our incoming class including virtual advising days and pre-orientation programs as well as Educational Opportunity Program online summer program.</li>
</ul>
<p>Lastly please know that you are the most important part of our efforts as we continue to work tirelessly to plan and prepare for how we navigate this situation together and I ask for your continued patience and understanding.  Please keep yourselves and your loved ones safe and well and if you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact Student Life at x4291.</p>

<p><strong>April 21, 2020: Email from VP Amy D&#8217;Olivo to all faculty:</strong></p>
<p>Good Evening,</p>
<p>April showers bring May flowers (let’s hope so).  Over the past month I have tried to strike the right balance in my updates sharing information that is at times important or concerning or encouraging.  COVID-19 continues to challenge us in so many ways- professionally, financially, psychologically, emotionally- hope you and your families are adapting.  The CU family also has to adapt. We have challenges to overcome for sure but creative thinking, sound money management, patience, and cooperation will keep CU strong.  Stay vigilant and be well.</p>
<p>Few items today—</p>
<ul>
<li>Exec Staff monitors communication regularly from NJ Secretary of Higher Ed, Governor, local health officials.  We are doing what is expected on all fronts.</li>
<li>Students in residence – about 65% of our students have cleared out their dorms to date.  Nearly 322 students confirmed dorms for next year.</li>
<li>Pat yourselves on the back—received an email from a Faculty member today that reads, “I have been talking to many students, and two in the past two days have mentioned how seamlessly Centenary transitioned to online.”  Students went on to compare CU with two other local institutions indicating that they are “still struggling to ‘get it right’” (students have siblings at these other schools).  Nice work all.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Last call for pics- if you would like your pic included in virtual commencement, please send a photo of yourself, in regalia if appropriate, to the following email address <u>ASAP</u> <a href="mailto:Commencement@centenaryuniversity.edu">Commencement@centenaryuniversity.edu</a></li>
<li>Latin honors- honors (Suma, Magna Cum Laude) are awarded after all courses are completed and final grades are posted.   Students earning these honors this year will receive a medal, an additional page for their program that includes honors, and a Dean’s List Certificate after all grades are posted.   For those that completed in December, honors are noted in the program already and they received their medals with their regalia.</li>
<li>Covid-19 considerations for academic standing, probation, dismissal<strong>&#8211; </strong>members of ARB (Academic Review Board) worked together to make some slight modifications to our policies in response to COVID-19 including:
<ul>
<li>Students who did not meet the minimum requirements to be in Good Academic Standing during the 2020SP semester will <u>still be</u> placed on Academic Probation (AP) but the student can appeal. If (or when) a student believes he/she is on AP due to circumstances surrounding Covid-19 (or concerning, involving, related to Covid-19), he/she can appeal to the Senior Director of Academic Success in writing within 10 days of being notified of their status on AP. In all appeals, student course grades prior to the University shifting to fully online/remote instruction will be considered.</li>
<li>Students who are on Academic Probation during the 2020SP semester will not be dismissed, if certain criteria were met prior to the move to remote instruction:
<ul>
<li>The student had not received any negative progress reports.</li>
<li>The grades reported by faculty indicate that the student was achieving the grades needed to be removed from AP.</li>
<li>The student was meeting regularly with a Success Specialist.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Any dismissal can be appealed through the Academic Review Board.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Videos- in the process of selecting our winners.  Stay tuned.</li>
<li>Budget requests- thank you to those who have responded already to my email requesting info from budget managers.  For those that have not, please do so by Friday.</li>

<p><strong>April 13, 2020: Email from VP Amy D&#8217;Olivo to all faculty:</strong></p>
<p>Good Evening,</p>
<p>The weather today added an additional layer of stress for many. While sunny in some places now, several lost trees and power earlier.  Be extra careful if you are out and about.</p>
<p>Few updates/requests</p>
<ul>
<li>Please ensure that your students have properly declared their major (or double major), including designating <strong>any</strong> respective minor(s).  Here’s the link to <a href="https://secure.centenaryuniversity.edu/change_of_major_form.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">change majors/minors</a>.</li>
<li>Leave of absences (LOA) or course withdrawals resulting from extenuating circumstances- please be aware that <u>we continue</u> to work (nothing new here &#8211; we always have) with students who may have to take a LOA or withdraw from courses as a result of an extenuating circumstance.  If you have a student seeking information about this, please refer them to Nicole Corley <a href="mailto:Nicole.Corley01@CentenaryUniversity.edu">Nicole.Corley01@CentenaryUniversity.edu</a> who will work with Lindsay Galasso to determine next steps.</li>
<li>Adjunct faculty Joe Pizzo recently had a poem published in the NJCTE English Journal. He also serves as a reviewer for the journal. The link to his poem &#8220;<a href="https://digitalcommons.montclair.edu/nj-english-journal/vol9/iss1/25/">What if the Arts Were Taken Away?</a>&#8220;</li>
<li>Honors Program update- 14 confirmed acceptances</li>
<li>Admitted Students Day page launches April 20</li>
<li>Commencement- attached is a communication shared with graduating students late last week.  The ceremony is coming together.  Students have received a communication from MarchingOrder, the vendor we are using.  The email from MarchingOrder may have ended up in their spam or junk folder. Please encourage students to look for the message and participate by completing the form.</li>

<p><strong>April 9, 2020: Email from VP Kerry Mullins &amp; VP Amy D&#8217;Olivo to Class of &#8217;20:</strong></p>
<p>Dear Class of 2020,</p>
<p>We are writing to follow-up on President Murphy’s announcement of our virtual Commencement. We have heard from some of you who applauded the virtual commencement ceremony, thanking us for honoring this day by not delaying.  Conversely, some are disappointed with the decision hoping instead for an on-ground option.</p>
<p>Commencement is the biggest event for our university. It is the culmination of the efforts of you, your peers, family, friends, faculty and staff. It is our proudest moment of the entire academic year. Commencement is also a time of festivities and celebrations. It is both the conferral of degrees and the celebration that makes Commencement so important.</p>
<p>Given the pandemic, we are not able to host Commencement as we have done in the past BUT we will honor, acknowledge, and celebrate every graduate virtually on May 9 as planned via a virtual ceremony.  Recognizing that the on-ground celebration is also a very important rite of passage, once the Governor lifts the stay at home order and ban of large gatherings, the administration along with student representation will work together to develop an on-ground event that celebrates your accomplishments and commemorates this milestone in your life.</p>
<p>No other graduating class in our proud 150+ year history has graduated virtually nor in the middle of a pandemic. As horrific as this situation is, this is a historical moment for you and your family and not one that you want to regret when you are older and sharing your story with your children and grandchildren. For this reason, we are asking you to participate in the virtual ceremony, the to-be-determined on-ground event, and if you are able, in the Spring 2021 ceremony. Yes, you are invited and encouraged to commence not once, not twice, but three times.</p>
<p>Lastly, we would be remiss if we did not recognize your Student Government Association especially Shelly Goldstein and Derek Elliott who have been representing you well and working with the administration throughout this process. There will be more communication regarding Commencement and other important decisions forthcoming, and we will continue to work with Shelly and Derek to ensure that you, the students, remain the focus of our efforts and work.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Dean Mullins &amp; Dr. D’Olivo</p>

<p><strong>April 6, 2020: Email from VP Amy D&#8217;Olivo to all faculty:</strong></p>
<p>Dear Colleagues,</p>
<p>What a beautiful day. Sunshine = Vitamin D.  Get out and enjoy when possible.  Please, be extra careful this week and next as we head into what many are calling the peak of this crisis.</p>
<p>Number of things to remind, update…</p>
<ul>
<li>Coming to campus: only employees deemed essential should be on campus regularly.  Each time someone comes into a building, additional cleaning and sanitization is required.  Please continue to alert me and security when you are coming to campus indicating where you need to go, time you are arriving, and how long you will be.  Thank you again for your cooperation.</li>
<li>Commencement Ceremony: plans for the virtual ceremony are underway.   If you are asked to provide any information pertaining to Commencement, please respond as quickly as possible.  Deadlines are very tight.</li>
</ul>
<p>Starting this year, we will have our traditional valedictorian as well as a transfer valedictorian.  We added the transfer because our traditional criteria almost always preclude transfers.</p>
<ul>
<li>Grades: for those teaching classes, please post all grades to date so that students have a real sense of how they are doing in your courses.  Please continue to work with students to the best of your ability should they have real challenges precluding them from completing work, submitting on-time, or delivering the best quality assignments.  If you have students unable to participate in classes due to lack of internet or equipment, please alert Lindsay Galasso.  Lindsay is working with others to provide suggestions and resources.</li>
<li>Zoom: NYC schools have banned the use of Zoom because of the recent security breaches.  In fact, members of our own CU community have had sessions interrupted by highly inappropriate images, words, etc. Please use Teams when possible.</li>
<li>Admissions Videos—we are inviting each of you (individually) to shoot and submit a one-minute video to be used by Admissions.  Please include the following:
<ul>
<li>Name and title: Hi, I am _______, Professor of or member of _____</li>
<li>Why student should choose Centenary (3-5 reasons). If faculty, 3-5 considerations that set our program apart</li>
<li>I can’t wait to see you in the Fall</li>
<li>90 seconds at most.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><u>Send to Amy and Corrine by April 10<sup>th</sup></u><sup>.  </sup> There will be PRIZES for <em>best overall video</em>, <em>most creative video</em>, <em>best content</em>, and <em>most professional</em>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Regarding summer classes and financial aid&#8211; “Financial aid for the summer term is generally limited to Federal Pell Grant, Federal Subsidized and Unsubsidized Direct Loans, Federal Parent Loan (PLUS), Federal Graduate Plus Loan and private loans. For most aid programs you must be enrolled for at least six credits in total during summer 2020 (Exceptions may include federal Pell Grant or private loans). The Financial Aid office will review less than 6 credits enrolled students and provide Pell if eligible.”  Please have students email or call the Financial Aid Office if they have questions about aid over the summer.</li>

<p><strong>April 3, 2020: Email to Campus Community regarding Commencement 2020:</strong></p>
<p>Dear Members of the Class of 2020,</p>
<p>I&#8217;m proud of the way you&#8217;ve accepted the challenge to complete your Centenary education online and graduate on time. All prospective graduates who satisfy their degree requirements will earn their degrees as planned on Saturday, May 9th, in a virtual commencement ceremony. We&#8217;re developing this ceremony with the input of your student leaders to make this a meaningful event for the Class of 2020. Hear more about our virtual commencement in the attached video.</p>
<p>We also understand your disappointment with the cancellation of Senior Week, so we&#8217;re working with student leadership to plan a reception to celebrate the achievements of the Class of 2020 on campus when the state-mandated quarantine is lifted.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m looking forward to the day when we can gather on campus safely and I can congratulate you in person as a proud graduate of Centenary University.</p>

<p><strong>March 31, 2020: Email from VP Amy D&#8217;Olivo to all faculty:</strong></p>
<p>Good Evening Colleagues,</p>
<p>Gloomy few days but Thursday looks like lots of sunshine.  Few updates today….</p>
<ul>
<li>Believe you all received the Coronavirus protocol message sent from Theresa Lord-Stout. Please do read it.  Adjunct faculty &#8211; please note the message was forwarded from me.</li>
<li>Registration going well.</li>
<li>Commencement &#8211; message from President forthcoming.</li>
<li>Reminder &#8211; anyone teaching a course may find themselves unable to complete the course for any number of reasons (this happens in face-to-face environment too).  Thinking about your courses—would someone be able to come into your course and teach it out OR could students complete essentially “on their own”?    This is something to think about.</li>
<li>Appreciate all the great updates on classes and activities.  Love to see some pics for those willing to share.</li>
</ul>
<p>Continue to stay vigilant about handwashing, sanitizing, and social distancing.  Together we can and will flatten the curve.</p>

<p><strong>March 30, 2020: Email from Health Services to Campus Community:</strong></p>
<p>Dear Centenary Community,</p>
<p>In response to concerns about COVID-19 expressed by faculty and staff, the Centenary University Health Office would like to share the following information and guidance with you:</p>
<ul>
<li>Centenary University was extremely fortunate with the timing of our Spring Break in conjunction with the surge of COVID-19 cases in New Jersey.  Most of our students and faculty have not been on campus since March 6<sup>th</sup>.  COVID-19 cases in New Jersey have spiked this past week.  Therefore, should any of our students or faculty since been diagnosed this past week or in the future, the risk to others in the Centenary community has already been minimized since we have exceeded the 14 day isolation period recommended by the CDC.  In addition, most staff have not been on campus since 3/12.  Today being 3/30, they have also exceeded the 14 day contagious period.</li>
<li>Although we have minimized our exposure to each other by working remotely from home,  there will undoubtedly still be an increase in the numbers of reported positive cases over the next few weeks.  This is because we all now have <strong>community exposures outside of campus contacts</strong>.</li>
<li>All positive cases are tracked and followed by the County Health Department in which the affected individual resides.  These professionals will follow-up with each newly diagnosed case, and all close contacts of that person.  Therefore, faculty or staff who may become aware of a student who has tested positive for COVID-19 can be assured that these cases will be tracked and monitored by the Department of Health and the student’s primary care provider.  Although faculty and staff are not required to report any known student cases, they may always contact Centenary University Health Services with any specific concerns they may have.  We are happy to follow-up with students who may need additional information or support.  Please know that issues regarding patient confidentiality (HIPAA) do not apply during times of pandemics.</li>
<li>Should employees of Centenary University (including faculty, staff or contracted workers) be diagnosed positive for COVID-19, they should contact their work supervisor as soon as possible to advise of their illness, and to receive instructions from HR regarding sick time benefits etc.  In addition these employees can expect a call from their county Health Department.</li>
<li>Please refer to <a href="https://s18945.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Protocol-For-Confirmed-Positive.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this algorithm</a> for additional guidance for managing any Centenary University Confirmed Positive COVID-19 cases.</li>
</ul>
<p>In closing, we implore your cooperation in any and all of our State and Federal mandates and recommendations.  As a community, we can help each other and all those we love.  The Centenary University Health Office and Human Resources Department are here to answer any questions or concerns you may have.  Please do not hesitate to reach out if we can be of any assistance to you.</p>
<p>Warm regards,</p>
<p>Theresa Lord-Stout<br />
<em>Director of Health Services</em></p>

<p><strong>March 30, 2020: Email from VP Amy D&#8217;Olivo to all faculty</strong></p>
<p>Good Evening Colleagues,</p>
<p>Quiet day overall.  Few updates&#8211;</p>
<ul>
<li>Registration – Nothing major to report from today.   Thank you for the strong advising work with students.  It is clearly making a difference.</li>
<li>Advising policy reminders – Michelle Meyer will be sending an email with advising reminders.</li>
<li>I have received several responses to my request for creative assignments, unique approaches etc.  Please continue to share.</li>
<li>Some departments have held virtual conversation hours for faculty and staff.  Love the idea.  Happy to host one for this group but given we are so large, smaller sessions might be preferred.</li>
<li>Reminder &#8211; only essential personnel should be on campus for extended periods of time.  If you must come in to complete a task or pick up materials, remember to alert security (they are logging activity).</li>
<li>Commencement, Hooding, Gala &#8211; hoping to have some decisions tomorrow.  Will share as soon as I have more information.</li>

<p><strong>March 27, 2020: Email from President Murphy to all faculty, staff, and students</strong></p>
<p>Dear Campus Community,</p>
<p>We’ve all faced tremendous challenges in the past couple of weeks. During this time, I’m so impressed with the way you’ve stayed true to Centenary University’s core values—especially our commitment to serving the community. Now, more than ever, they need our help.</p>
<p>Cyclones are finding unique ways to ensure that people are well cared for during this crisis:</p>
<ul>
<li>Recognizing that hunger never takes a break—especially during a pandemic—Student Life partnered with our food service provider, Sodexo, to provide 100 bagged lunches to Norwescap Food Bank based in Phillipsburg, NJ, for needy area residents. All meals were prepared while practicing social distancing and Assistant Dean for Student Life Tiffany Kushner volunteered to make the delivery to Norwescap.</li>
<li>Director of Health Services Theresa Lord-Stout donated all of our extra personal protective equipment normally used in our labs, Health Center, and Facilities to Hackettstown Hospital. The hospital was extremely grateful to receive 8,200 pairs of gloves, a case of gowns, and 150 face masks. The donation was made in partnership with National Management Resources, our contracted facilities company.</li>
<li>Our Sports and Entertainment Management students are planning to host a virtual Call of Duty tournament to raise funds for a local middle school student who is currently battling Ewing sarcoma.</li>
<li>Community Engagement Coordinator Rachel Danitz and Associate Professor of History Dr. Noah Haiduc-Dale, along with our students, are planning a virtual Relay for Life to support the American Cancer Society.</li>
</ul>
<p>These efforts, and so many others, make me truly proud to be president of Centenary University. Moving forward, I’ll continue to keep you updated on ways our University is remaining Cyclone Strong during this crisis.</p>
<p>Be well!</p>
<p>Dr. Bruce Murphy<br />
<em>President</em></p>

<p>Before I share the update, I would like to take a moment to acknowledge each of you and our students.  The circumstances have demanded more from all of us.  Our professional and personal lives are colliding, pressure to learn new technologies is mounting, day-to-day life has been drastically altered, and yet, under these extraordinary circumstances, we are being asked to be good teachers, effective tutors, good students, provide academic and emotional support, engage as informed advisors, be compassionate caregivers, be strong partners, and act as decent human beings.  With so much pressure, we all need to find ways to cope.  Take care of yourselves.  Here is a link to a video that might provide a good laugh <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCe5PaeAeew">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCe5PaeAeew</a> .  Also, attached please find the EAP (<a href="https://s18945.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Unum-EAP.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Employee Assistance Program</a>) flyer should you feel you need some additional support.</p>
<p>All and all, the semester is progressing nicely.  April 1<sup>st</sup> is just around the corner with the last day of class, May 1, only a month away.  Many end-of-semester activities are underway.  Nancy and Catherine have been active this week gathering and sharing information.</p>
<p>Here are few updates&#8211;</p>
<ul>
<li>Please talk with students and assure them that while the University is not making widespread changes to our grading practices, Centenary faculty continue to be attentive to the whole student, working with each individually to address any unique challenges.  Also, please be aware that students have been, and continue to be, allowed to access their dorm rooms if they need to get books, materials, etc.</li>
<li>Caring relationships between faculty and students/staff and students matter significantly.  Please continue to make every effort to connect in meaningful ways with your students.</li>
<li>Registration starts Monday. We are raising the threshold on the outstanding balance to assist students.  Holds will be placed if a student has a balance of 5,000 or more (currently 2,500).   A message will be sent to students as well.</li>
<li>Academic Awards ceremony &#8211; We are getting ready for spring academic awards.  Catherine and Nancy will be reaching out to gather information from each department.  The Academic Awards Ceremony scheduled for April 23 will be virtual.  Please submit the requested items (see email from Catherine/Nancy<strong>) <span style="text-decoration: underline;">no</span><u> later than</u> </strong>Friday, April 3.</li>
<li>Student evaluations – April 13-26 student evals will be available.  Student evaluations provide both formative and summative information.  Student comments provide valuable feedback to instructors.  When used as an evaluative tool, extra attention will be paid to the comparison between this semester and previous semesters recognizing the impact of this extraordinary semester prompted by Covid-19.  A specific question has been added to the bank regarding the mid-semester change of delivery method to differentiate the student experience if appropriate (again nearly 105 of our courses were already in the online blended format).</li>
<li>Peer observations- Catherine sent an email yesterday regarding peer observations.</li>
<li>Chair elections &#8211; Because the reorganization will likely be delayed, those departments with chairs up for reelection this year should go ahead and hold the election as per the Constitution <u>with the understanding</u> that if the department is impacted by the reorg (e.g., combined with another department, moved within a school), new elections will likely be required.   An option for the departments needing to elect this year&#8211; elect someone for a one-year term and see what the reorganization brings.</li>
<li>Teacher of the year &#8211; survey available (Catherine sent via email earlier this week)</li>
<li>Reorganization—I am still waiting to hear from a few programs.  Will update you as soon as I gather all input.</li>

<p>Good Afternoon,</p>
<p>Making some progress on a long standing list of academic “to dos”.  Hope others are finding productive time for long standing items between students, family, and the need for some fresh air.</p>
<p>Few updates—</p>
<div class="vimeo-responsive-container"><iframe  width="640" height="640" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" data-src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/400740682" class="lazyload" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="></iframe></div>
<ul>
<li>Video above worth watching. Lots of good info about Coronavirus.</li>
<li>Only key and essential employees are to be on campus until further notice. Please refrain from coming to campus other than to get something you require to do your job.  <u>Please let security know you are coming as they are keeping a log of campus activity</u>.</li>
<li>Grading considerations- some of you are already aware of a broader dialogue (outside of CU mostly) about changes to grading policies such as a move to pass/fail or <em>choose your own adventure</em> (my words) in response to the national shift to online/remote education.</li>
</ul>
<p>I met with chairs and members of academic support staff today to get some input.  Please <a href="https://s18945.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Pass-Fail-Considerations-.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this document</a>.</p>
<p>CU is not considering alternations to grading policies, but faculty have my support and encouragement to work with students on a case-by-case basis. Faculty can, for example, issue a grade with the understanding it can be adjusted after a student completes an assignment OR an incomplete can be given to a student whose computer stopped working.   If you are looking for guidance on a specific student or situation, consider talking with Academic Success staff as they often have insights about individual student challenges, the department chair, or me.</p>
<ul>
<li>Commencement, Hooding, Gala- still under discussion.</li>
<li>March 30 first day of Priority Registration.  Many of you are reporting one on one meetings with students have been very productive but time consuming.  Consider small group sessions.</li>
</ul>
<p>Be well.</p>
<p>Kind Regards,<br />

<p><strong>March 24, 2020: Email from VP Amy D&#8217;Olivo to all faculty</strong></p>
<p>Good Afternoon Colleagues,</p>
<p>Seems like many are settling into the routine of working, teaching, and learning from home.  A few updates from today….</p>
<ul>
<li>Executive Staff met today to discuss Commencement and the Gala. No final decisions have been made. Thanks for your patience as we determine the best way to handle these major events.</li>
<li>A colleague got me thinking…. anyone teaching a course may find themselves unable to complete the course for any number of reasons (this happens in face-to-face environment too).  Thinking about your courses—would someone be able to come into your course and teach it out OR could students complete essentially “on their own”?    This is something to think about.  Are there things you can do to prepare your “course” for ease of completion if needed?</li>
<li>Some student feedback- students have expressed a desire for more direct communication in their courses in the form of face-to-face (virtual face-to-face) engagement.  Consider adding synchronous course sessions, small group sessions or individual meetings with students.</li>
<li>Outreach to students who are not engaging continues.  ASAC and Student Life staff are contacting faculty directly to assist.  Thank you to those utilizing Pharos.</li>
<li>The Coronavirus Communication page has been updated and streamlined.</li>
</ul>
<p>I have received some great feedback on the advice/thoughts/ideas document shared yesterday. Thank you to those who contributed.</p>
<p>Kind Regards,<br />

<p>Dear Cyclones,</p>
<p>I am writing to give you an update regarding Centenary’s response to COVID-19 and to let you know that we realize that this situation is difficult for all, and we are continuously thinking about you and your families during these times of uncertainty. This is especially true for our seniors, whom we have watched work hard in the classroom and on the fields and courts over the last four years. You have dedicated so much to your studies, to your personal growth and to our community. We are looking at all options to celebrate all of your accomplishments, dedication and hard work and will be in touch soon regarding the plans for Commencement.</p>
<p>As President Murphy has shared on several occasions, the well-being of our students and our community is of the utmost concern therefore since January, we have been monitoring closely the COVID-19 situation as it unfolds around the world and took appropriate action including activating our emergency response plan and implementing a pandemic assessment team. President Murphy has shared many of the steps we have taken to prepare and respond for a scenario like this. To that end I would like to highlight the efforts undertaken by Student Life to support you during this time including:</p>
<p><strong>Health Services:</strong></p>

<li>Part 2 of our approach is the residents that have left campus who would like to return to pick up items.  Residence Life will be following up with a timeframe and plan for the move out process but have assured that your items are safe and secured during this time.

</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><em>With regards to the room and board refund question; As President Murphy stated, Centenary must act responsibly to avoid inadvertently forfeiting any financial relief coming from the public sector, our insurance carriers, or our vendor contracts by making premature decisions. As a result, while we have begun to review the issue of refunds for room and board, a decision on refunds or a refund process will not be made until later in the semester. </em><strong> </strong></p>

</ul>
<p><strong>Parent Communication:</strong></p>
<p>Parents and family members play an important role in your support, especially during these difficult times. Parents and families should have received several emails regarding the university’s response to COVID-19. If they have not received these updates and would like to receive future updates, I ask that they please send an email with their student’s name and their preferred email address to <a href="mailto:Nicole.Corley01@CentenaryUniversity.edu">Nicole.Corley01@CentenaryUniversity.edu</a>. They can also access past communications to parents and families that are available on our webpage <a href="https://www.centenaryuniversity.edu/coronavirus-communications/">https://www.centenaryuniversity.edu/coronavirus-communications/</a></p>

<p>Lastly, we want to remind you to stay healthy by following precautions and monitoring your health including:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Avoid close contact with others</em><strong> (</strong>particularly by those who are sick) and practice social distancing: staying 6 feet apart from one another, avoiding direct contact through touch (e.g. shaking hands, sharing items or congregating in large venues)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><em>Stay home when you are sick.</em><strong><br />
</strong>If possible, stay home from work, school, and errands when you are sick. This will help prevent spreading your illness to others.</li>
<li><em>Cover your mouth and nose.</em><strong><br />
</strong>Cover your mouth and nose with a tissue when coughing or sneezing. It may prevent those around you from getting sick.</li>
<li><em>Clean your hands.</em><strong><br />
</strong>Washing your hands often will help protect you from germs. If soap and water are not available, use an alcohol-based hand rub.</li>
<li><em>Avoid touching your eyes, nose or mouth</em><strong>.<br />
</strong>Germs are often spread when a person touches something that is contaminated with germs and then touches his or her eyes, nose, or mouth.</li>
<li><em>Practice other good health habits.</em><strong><br />
</strong>Clean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces at home, work or school, especially when someone is ill. Get plenty of sleep, be physically active, manage your stress, drink plenty of fluids, and eat nutritious food.</li>
</ul>
<p>As we continue to navigate this situation together, we thank you for your patience and understanding. We ask that you please check your email daily as well as the university webpage for additional information. If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me at <a href="mailto:Kerry.mullins@centenaryunviersity.edu">Kerry.Mullins@centenaryunviersity.edu</a>.</p>
<p>Take care and be well.</p>

<p><strong>March 22, 2020: Email from President Murphy to all faculty, staff, students and parents</strong></p>
<p>Dear Campus Community,</p>
<p>In accordance with Governor Murphy’s <a href="https://covid19.nj.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">executive order</a> issued yesterday, I am writing to let you know that Centenary University has complied with all requirements as we keep the safety of our community at the forefront of our efforts. All of our classes have moved to online and most of our residential students are living off campus. We have developed a plan to triage and manage the few students who remain on campus should they become ill. Residence Life and Security staff have received training on our triage plan and have been educated on the proper use of personal protective equipment. We are maintaining support of our community so please refer to an <a href="https://www.centenaryuniversity.edu/coronavirus-communications/">updated page</a> on our website that outlines all of the support services in place to address the COVID-19 and most importantly support our community during this time.</p>
<p>Effective immediately, all employees not designated <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Key &amp; Essential</strong></span> will be asked to work remotely until further notice. Let me emphasize that all jobs at Centenary are important but some have been so categorized to meet this emergency. If you are unclear about your status, check with your supervisor.</p>
<p>Additionally, we received notice today that one of our contractors has tested positive for COVID-19. The individual is receiving appropriate medical care in a quarantined environment. We are disinfecting any area that the contractor may have come in contact with. Additionally any person that had close contact with this individual has been asked to self-quarantine for the next 14 days.</p>
<p>We continue to monitor this rapidly evolving pandemic. We remain collaborative with the Warren County Department of Health, and vigilant on updates from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the New Jersey Department of Health. In closing, we thank the members of our Centenary family for your cooperation and support of our efforts to keep our community safe and we wish you and your families good health.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Dr. Bruce Murphy<br />
<em>President</em></p>

<p><strong>March 22, 2020: Email from VP Amy D&#8217;Olivo to all faculty</strong></p>
<p>Good Evening,<br />
National, state, and local efforts to flatten the curve continue. This weekend, Governor Murphy restricted activity of NJ residents even further. This newest order has prompted a few changes here at CU as well&#8212;-</p>
<p>• All non-essential employees will work remotely. This means that nearly all CU staff will be working remotely. If you must come to campus, remember buildings are locked so bring a key or reach out to security to let you in.<br />
• University libraries and computer labs must close.<br />
• Some students were electively riding at the Equine Center, but this too has been discontinued.</p>
<p>For those that have alerted me to “missing” students, ASAC and Student Life staff are attempting to communicate with each. Additionally, a message has been posted (or will be) to our social media platforms reminding students that ALL students should be engaged with their instructors and Moodle.</p>
<p>Our community is responding well, growing stronger despite the situation. Thank you for your continued patience, flexibility and support of our students and one another. Please take advantage of the many resources available to assist with courses, meetings, advising, and for your own mental and physical health needs.</p>
<p>Here if I can be of any assistance or address questions.</p>
<p>Kind Regards,<br />

<p><strong>March 20, 2020: Email from Director of Athletics to all student athletes</strong></p>
<p>Dear Centenary Student-Athletes,</p>
<p>As of today, the CSAC Board of Presidents has agreed to cancel all athletic activity for the remainder of the spring 2020 semester. This decision was made in reaction to the COVID-19 pandemic and in accordance to the decisions made by most of the other NCAA conferences.</p>
<p>This decision does not come without consequences. Losing an entire sport season can be detrimental to the growth and experience of all of you. The NCAA is offering a waiver for spring sport athletes to gain another year of eligibility. More information will come on how we will process this waiver, should you choose to accept it.</p>
<p>For the Cyclone family, I ask that you take this situation seriously. We are in uncharted territory and managing life day to day. Please consult with all <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/">CDC guidelines</a> to monitor your health and safety.</p>
<p>As a student-athlete, I ask that you continue to manage your academics daily. You are expected to fulfill all the classroom requirements through your on-line learning. If you need assistance, please contact a University administrator or your coach. We will assist in any way possible.</p>
<p>For the seniors, I want to say <strong>THANK YOU</strong> for your patience and understanding through these last few weeks. Your dedication to the department has not gone unnoticed. The effort that you demonstrated in my short two-years as Athletics Director has set the tone for the future. Your programs are better because of your leadership.</p>
<p>I will be sending more emails about upcoming events and other information weekly. Take this time to focus on your schoolwork and find ways to be productive in your sport while practicing social distancing. These next few weeks will be an indicator of how our programs will compete next season.</p>
<p>Please feel free to contact me with any questions. Staff and coaches will have limited time on-campus, so email or phone are the best methods of communication. Continue to make sound decisions and remember to stay safe.</p>
<p>Stay Golden and Cyclone Strong,</p>
<p>Travis A. Spencer<br />

<p><strong>March 20, 2020: Email from Dr. Bruce Murphy to all Centenary students</strong></p>
<p>Dear Centenary Students and Families,</p>
<p>It’s been an unprecedented week at Centenary University and at campuses around the country. As we adjust to completing the semester online, I know that you have many questions.</p>
<p><strong>Right now, our singular focus at Centenary is keeping our students and staff safe, while doing everything that needs to be done to ensure that all students complete the semester, and that those scheduled to graduate receive their degrees on time.</strong></p>
<p>Many complex issues have arisen regarding the impact of COVID-19 on higher education. Among the most pressing are some very important financial questions, including various hardships faced by many of our own students and staff.</p>
<p><strong>In addressing these financial concerns, Centenary must act responsibly to avoid inadvertently forfeiting any financial relief coming from the public sector, our insurance carriers, or our vendor contracts by making premature decisions. As a result, while we have begun to review the issue of refunds for room and board, a decision on refunds or a refund process will not be made until later in the semester.</strong></p>
<p>Please be assured that Centenary is working round-the-clock to address your concerns, while prioritizing the safety and security of our entire campus community. We will continue to follow the guidance from local, state, and national officials during this crisis.</p>
<p>We appreciate your understanding and will have more to share on these important issues in coming days.<br />
Sincerely,</p>
<p>Dr. Bruce Murphy<br />

<p><strong>March 20, 2020: Email from VP Amy D&#8217;Olivo to all faculty</strong></p>
<p>Happy Friday,<br />
What a week! Few additional updates and considerations&#8212;<br />
• SATs have been cancelled by College Board<br />
• Expect delays and slowdowns with your home internet providers. Video and audio disruptions are likely. Practice patience and deep breathing&#x1f60a;<br />
• FERPA- you can disclose student info without consent under “health and safety emergency” but that information is limited to appropriate officials (not well defined but certainly all health officials and student life). Limited to the state of specific emergency when necessary to protect students. We have been told, “document and do what’s right”<br />
• Some have indicated students are not responsive, some not even logging into Moodle. Not sure how widespread this is. Please let me know if you are finding this to be the case.<br />
• When working with students and colleagues, please consider&#8212;&#8211;</p>
<p>If some do, some don’t&#8212;</p>
<p><em><strong>Some</strong></em> have homes and supportive families<br />
<em><strong>Some</strong></em> have full refrigerators and pantries<br />
<em><strong>Some</strong></em> can adapt easily<br />
<em><strong>Some</strong></em> live alone<br />
<strong><em>Some</em></strong> have confidence in their ability to write<br />
<em><strong>Some</strong></em> have a quiet place to work<br />
<em><strong>Some</strong></em> care for sick loved ones<br />
<em><strong>Some</strong></em> are comfortable with technology</p>
<p>Hoping you are finding your groove and settling into a routine. Faculty- “see” you Monday for the Teams Faculty Meeting.</p>

<p><strong>March 19, 2020: Email from VP Amy D&#8217;Olivo to all faculty</strong></p>
<p>Good Evening Colleagues,</p>
<p>Few updates, with some good news included&#8212;</p>
<ul>
<li>Board met today
<ul>
<li>Dana Benbow promoted to Associate Professor and Lisa Plantamura to Full Professor.  Well deserved! Congratulations to both.</li>
<li>BS in Health Science approved</li>
<li>Faculty and staff commended for their efforts making the shift to online so quickly</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Academic Awards Ceremony (formerly Honors Convocation) will be held virtually.  Catherine, Nancy, Lauren and I are working on the details.  More to come.</li>
<li>Many have successfully held meetings and/or classes with Teams. Don’t be afraid to try it.</li>
<li>Lisa Plantamura had been working on a Best Practices document for the past few months.  In light of our shift to remote learning, she finalized it this week (thank you Lisa).  Please see attached but note that these guidelines are intended for times when we can plan.  Take from it what makes sense for your classes now with an eye toward revisions to future courses.</li>
<li>Online form for dropping a course is working well.  Reminder to advisors, before you approve, <u>check if the reduction in credits takes the student below 12 credits as this has Fin Aid implications</u>.</li>
<li>CU, like all universities, is discussing refunds for housing and meals. No decisions have been made.</li>
</ul>
<p>Presence on campus is thinning but spirits are good.  Community is pulling together in amazing ways.</p>

<p><strong>March 17, 2020: Email from VP Amy D&#8217;Olivo to all faculty</strong></p>
<p>Dear Faculty Colleagues,<br />
Happy St. Patrick’s Day! Not much new today from State or Federal officials that necessitates action on the academic front. Decisions about Commencement and other late April events have yet to be made. Here are a few items for your use and consideration&#8212;</p>
<p>• Last day for students to withdraw from a class without incurring an F is this Friday. Students received email reminder today.<br />
• Advising- please be sure you are communicating with your advisees in anticipation of Priority Registration (March 30)<br />
• Recording of courses and course related content<br />
o     For those using Teams, when recording is enabled a message appears at the top of all participants screens advising them that they are being recorder. When stopping recording, a similar message appears notifying everyone that the recording has stopped.<br />
o     Recording Policy to be included in your syllabi. I am asking Lisa Plantamura to include this with our University Syllabus Statements moving forward:<br />
<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Recording of Courses or Course Related Activities</strong></span><br />
Recording of courses and/or course related activities is prohibited unless advance written permission is obtained from the class instructor and any guest presenter(s). An instructor may provide such permission to an entire class as part of the course syllabus or other written description of a course. Students who require recording or other adaptations of lectures as a reasonable accommodation for a disability should contact the Disability Service Office (DSO) in advance of the lecture in order to obtain permission for the recording.</p>
<p>In the event permission to record classroom lectures and/or other course related activities is granted, the instructor will notify all students, speakers, and other lecture attendees in advance that recording may occur. Every effort should be made to protect the confidentiality of a student with a disability who is being granted an accommodation (e.g., the professor will not name the student who is doing the recording when it is due to a disability accommodation).</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>Limitations on Use of Recordings and Materials</em></span><br />
Permission to allow lecture recording is not a transfer of any copyrights in the recording or related course materials. Such recordings and materials may be used only for individual or group study with other students enrolled in the same class, and may not be reproduced, transferred, distributed, or displayed in any public or commercial manner.<br />
Students must destroy recordings at the end of the semester in which they are enrolled in the class.<br />
Students who either record courses and/or course related activities without advanced instructor permission and/or use a recording for any purpose other than to study, may be reported to the Academic Review Board. Additionally, charges of theft of intellectual property are possible.</p>

<p><strong>March 16, 2020: Email from Dr. Bruce Murphy to all Centenary students, parents, alumni, staff</strong></p>
<p>Dear Centenary Community,</p>
<p>In response to the COVID-19 outbreak, New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy has issued an executive order(104) directing all institutions of higher learning to cease in-person instruction until further notice. As a result, Centenary University has made the following decisions:</p>
<ul>
<li>All classes will move to online instruction for the remainder of the semester.</li>
<li>All public events will be cancelled until further notice and events such as Academic Symposium, Leadership Awards, Commencement, etc., will be considered on a case by case basis.</li>
<li>University offices will continue to remain open.</li>
<li>We will continue to urge our campus community to practice social distancing, as recommended by national health experts, to slow disease transmission.</li>
<li>Centenary will continue to follow the ongoing guidance issued by Governor Murphy, as well as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the New Jersey Department of Health.</li>
</ul>
<p>This situation is evolving rapidly and you probably have many questions. I will do my best to keep you informed of the latest news via email, on our website and our social media.</p>
<p>As a nation, we are in uncharted territory. We understand that this situation is difficult for all. However, the health and well-being of our students and campus community must always remain our number one priority.</p>
<p>I’m very proud of the way our University community has responded to this evolving crisis. Together, we are Cyclone strong.</p>
<p>Thank you for your continued support of Centenary.</p>
<p>Sincerely,<br />
Dr. Bruce Murphy<br />
<em>President</em></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Cross-training</strong>:  Employees should be trained in more than one role or skill, and should be able to perform other tasks within their department in addition to their primary responsibilities.</li>
<li><strong>Operating procedures</strong>:  Departments should create written instructions on how to perform various day-to-day tasks so all department members can refer to them in the event that an employee is out of the office.  Save these instructions on a shared drive so that all department members can access them.</li>
<li><strong>Telecommuting</strong>:  Telecommuting may be an option depending on an employee’s position.  Saving files on OneDrive or SharePoint can be helpful in the event that an employee needs to access work documents from home.  Utilizing Microsoft Teams and call forwarding can also be useful.  Please check with your supervisor or the Vice President for your area to see if telecommuting would be an option.  If you have any questions regarding the technology required for telecommuting, please contact the IT Help Desk at x2000 or <a href="mailto:HelpDesk@CentenaryUniversity.edu">HelpDesk@CentenaryUniversity.edu</a>.</li>

<p><strong>March 4, 2020: Health Services Guidelines for Infection Control</strong></p>
<p>Dear Campus Community,</p>
<p>In response to the rapidly evolving coronavirus (COVID-19), we write to make Centenary University students and employees aware of the steps that the University has taken to safeguard the health and wellbeing of our campus community:</p>
<ul>
<li>All Centenary University sponsored international Spring Break trips have been cancelled.</li>
<li>All maintenance and housekeeping personnel will be performing a major disinfection initiative of all campus buildings.</li>
<li>Health services has increased stock of personal protective equipment to assist in infection control. Other departments will be trained in the use of this equipment as deemed necessary.</li>
<li>Hand sanitizing stations are located throughout campus.  A newly installed hand sanitizer is located outside of the Dining Hall.  All dining patrons will be asked to wash their hands prior to entering the cafeteria.</li>
<li>Because the risk of the virus outbreak is still not fully understood, <strong>we strongly recommend you do not travel abroad to countries where cases have been reported </strong>(you can find a list of those at the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/locations-confirmed-cases.html">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website</a>).</li>
<li>With the over-arching goal of keeping our students and employees safe, and in keeping with other universities’ best practices, we implore your assistance in helping us to monitor the travel of our community members over Spring Break.  Therefore, if you pursue personal travel over Spring Break, (either international OR domestic travel) we ask that you complete this voluntary travel registry form <a href="https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=paE12reAp0utD68YG3ZbEK2siR7KxPNDqkCmxpIKQ0BUNjZENEgzUERTRVRIVzcyQkRLVEdNWk5KTi4u">HERE</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Please be assured that this information will be kept confidential within the Health Services Department</strong>.</p>
<p>We also ask that you register with the U.S. Department of State through the <a href="https://step.state.gov/step/">Smart Traveler Enrollment Program</a>. You should continually monitor ongoing guidance from the <a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/traveladvisories/ea/novel-coronavirus-hubei-province--china.html">U.S. Department of State</a> and the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/index.html">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a>. Please note that those traveling internationally may experience disruption to their travel plans within countries, resulting in the alteration of their plans for re-entry to the United States due to U.S. or other nations’ quarantine decisions. If traveling to <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/locations-confirmed-cases.html">an impacted area</a>, you may need to self-isolate and/or be quarantined for at least 14 days.</p>
<ul>
<li>If students are now in need of housing within your Residence Hall for Spring Break, please contact Matt Lavery at <a href="mailto:Matthew.Lavery01@CentenaryUniversity.edu">Matthew.Lavery01@CentenaryUniversity.edu</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Should you have any questions or concerns, we are here to assist in any way.  Please feel free to contact Health Services at ext. 2209, or Human Resources at ext. 2332</p>
<p>Wishing you all a restful and relaxing Spring Break!</p>

<p><strong>March 2, 2020: Email from Health Services to Campus Community</strong></p>
<p>Dear Campus Community,</p>
<p>In response to our recent influenza cases, and in light of the rapidly evolving coronavirus outbreaks throughout the world, we are asking your cooperation in helping keep our Centenary Family healthy.  In an effort to enhance our infection control practices, we are reminding everyone of the importance of handwashing in controlling the spread of disease.  Throughout the coming week, you will see Health Office staff outside the dining hall, asking that you wash your hands before entering.  We will also be given an opportunity to disinfect your cell phone using our “Phone Soap” Machine, which uses UV light to kill bacteria present on your device.</p>
<p>To reiterate our previous plea for infection control, we remind you to also please:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Avoid close contact with people who are sick. When you are sick, keep your distance from others to protect them from getting sick too.</strong></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Stay home when you are sick.</strong><strong><br />
</strong>If possible, stay home from work, school, and errands when you are sick. This will help prevent spreading your illness to others.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cover your mouth and nose.</strong><strong><br />
</strong>Cover your mouth and nose with a tissue when coughing or sneezing. It may prevent those around you from getting sick. Flu and other serious respiratory illnesses, like respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), whooping cough, and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), are spread by cough, sneezing, or unclean hands.</li>
<li><strong>Clean your hands.</strong><strong><br />
</strong>Washing your hands often will help protect you from germs. If soap and water are not available, use an alcohol-based hand rub.</li>
<li><strong>Avoid touching your eyes, nose or mouth.</strong><strong><br />
</strong>Germs are often spread when a person touches something that is contaminated with germs and then touches his or her eyes, nose, or mouth.</li>
<li><strong>Practice other good health habits.</strong><strong><br />
</strong>Clean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces at home, work or school, especially when someone is ill. Get plenty of sleep, be physically active, manage your stress, drink plenty of fluids, and eat nutritious food.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>February 7, 2020: Email from Health Services to Faculty, Staff and Students</strong></p>
<p>Dear Centenary University Students, Faculty and Staff,</p>
<p>Many university students, faculty and staff in New Jersey are concerned about the current outbreak of the 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) and its potential impact to their communities.  In anticipation of questions or concerns you may have, I write to share how Centenary University is working to prepare for and prevent the spread of illness, and to promote wellness throughout our campuses.</p>
<p>First, it’s important to acknowledge that at this moment, the seasonal flu is the main public health concern in our region.  In addition<strong>, although the CDC considers the 2019-nCoV to be a serious health concern, the immediate health risk to the general U.S. public is considered low at this time.  </strong></p>
<p>Centenary University Health Office is committed to safeguarding the health and wellness of our campus communities.  As such, we are monitoring the 2019-nCoV through regular updates by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the New Jersey Department of Health (NJDOH).  We are working closely with our International Studies Department, and we have participated in the Clinician Outreach and Communication Activity (COCA) for the 2019 Novel Coronavirus which was held on January 31, 2020.  In addition, we continue to maintain our exceptional standard of care which includes infection control practices, immunization compliance initiatives, health education on measures to prevent illness, and ongoing aggressive influenza vaccination outreach.</p>
<p>Information on the 2019 Novel Coronavirus is rapidly evolving, but we are disseminating the most up to date details that we have received as of today.  The following is an excerpt from the most recent New Jersey Department of Health Update:</p>
<p><img   alt="" width="780" height="121" data-srcset="https://s18945.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/NJ-Dept-of-Health-Logo.png 780w, https://s18945.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/NJ-Dept-of-Health-Logo-300x47.png 300w, https://s18945.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/NJ-Dept-of-Health-Logo-768x119.png 768w"  data-src="https://s18945.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/NJ-Dept-of-Health-Logo.png" data-sizes="(max-width: 780px) 100vw, 780px" class="size-full wp-image-25646 alignnone lazyload" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" /><noscript><img class="size-full wp-image-25646 alignnone" src="https://s18945.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/NJ-Dept-of-Health-Logo.png" alt="" width="780" height="121" srcset="https://s18945.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/NJ-Dept-of-Health-Logo.png 780w, https://s18945.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/NJ-Dept-of-Health-Logo-300x47.png 300w, https://s18945.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/NJ-Dept-of-Health-Logo-768x119.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 780px) 100vw, 780px" /></noscript></p>
<p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is working hard to learn as much as possible about this 2019‐nCoV so that we can better understand how it spreads and characterize its associated illness. The New Jersey Department of Health is also working hard to develop guidance and education materials, in the face of evolving information.</p>
<p><strong>Though the CDC considers 2019‐nCoV to be a serious public health concern based on current information, the immediate health risk to the general U.S. public is considered low at this time</strong>. The CDC and the World Health Organization are closely monitoring the national and global situation and providing ongoing guidance.  <strong>At this time, the CDC recommends avoiding nonessential travel to China.  </strong>Updated travel information specific to 2019‐nCoV can be found at:</p>
<p><a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/notices/watch/novel‐coronavirus‐china">https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/notices/watch/novel‐coronavirus‐china</a>.</p>
<p>The New Jersey Department of Health is providing the resources specific to management of students who have returned to New Jersey from recent travel in areas with known transmission of 2019‐nCov. This guidance is, in part, based on new scientific information available on novel coronavirus (2019‐nCoV) transmission and the need to limit transmission in our communities.</p>
<p><strong><u>General Information</u></strong></p>
<p><strong>What is the difference between seasonal and novel coronavirus?</strong></p>
<p>Coronaviruses are a family of viruses and there are different types of coronavirus within that family, much like there are different types of influenza viruses. Coronaviruses in general are not new, they are quite common and are a frequent cause of respiratory illnesses such as the common cold. Coronaviruses tend to circulate in the fall and winter months, similar to influenza. Most people get infected with these viruses at some point in their lives.</p>
<p>The type of coronavirus that has recently emerged in Wuhan, China <strong>is a new type </strong>of coronavirus and is infecting people for the first time (which means that people do not have any immunity to it).</p>
<p><strong>What are common symptoms of 2019‐nCoV?</strong></p>
<p>Information to date suggests this virus is causing symptoms consistent with a respiratory illness such as cough, fever, and shortness of breath.</p>
<p><strong>How is 2019‐nCoV spread?</strong></p>
<p>At this time, it’s unclear how easily or sustainably this virus is spreading between people. Typically, with most respiratory viruses, people are thought to be most contagious when they are most symptomatic (the sickest). Chinese officials report that sustained person‐to‐person spread in the community is occurring in China. Person‐to‐person spread in the United States has been detected in a close, household contact to an individual confirmed to have 2019‐nCoV, <strong>but the risk to the general public remains low.</strong> Cases in healthcare settings, like hospitals, may also occur.</p>
<p><strong>What measures can be taken to prevent 2019‐nCoV?</strong></p>
<p>There is currently no vaccine to prevent 2019‐nCoV infection. The best way to prevent infection is to avoid being exposed to this virus. However, as a reminder, CDC always recommends everyday preventive actions to help prevent the spread of respiratory viruses.</p>
<p><strong>How is 2019‐nCoV treated?</strong></p>
<p>Currently, there is no specific antiviral treatment recommended for the coronavirus. There is no vaccine to prevent this virus, and the CDC advises that the best way to prevent infection is to avoid being exposed to this virus. Specific measures include washing hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds or using an alcohol-based hand sanitizer if soap and water are not available and avoiding others who are sick.</p>
<p><strong>If a person traveled to China in the last 14 days and is sick with fever, cough or difficulty breathing they </strong><strong>should:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Seek medical care right away. <strong>Before you go to a doctor’s office or emergency room, call ahead and </strong><strong>tell them about your recent travel and your symptoms.</strong></li>
<li>Avoid contact with others.</li>
<li>Not travel while sick.</li>
<li>Cover your mouth and nose with a tissue or your sleeve (not your hands) when coughing or sneezing.</li>
<li>Wash hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. Use an alcohol‐based hand sanitizer if soap and water are not available.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Do school events need to be canceled?</strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong><strong>At this time, there is no need to cancel school or social events</strong>. There are no cases of 2019‐nCoV in New Jersey, and there are no restrictions on public gatherings. Students should be reminded that part of good respiratory hygiene is staying home from events when they are ill.</p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>HOWEVER, ANY STUDENT, FACULTY OR STAFF WHO HAS TRAVELED TO CHINA IN THE PAST 14 DAYS SHOULD IMMEDIATELY CONTACT UNIVERSITY HEALTH SERVICES.</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>What preventive measures should be taken to help reduce the spread of respiratory viruses?</strong></p>
<p>NJDOH recommends that schools increase education on respiratory hygiene. Students, faculty and staff should all be asked to follow these steps that prevent the transmission of respiratory infections:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cover your coughs and sneezes with a tissue or into your sleeve, not your hands.</li>
<li>Avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth.</li>
<li>Wash hands often for at least 20 seconds, especially after coughing or sneezing. Use alcohol‐based hand sanitizer if soap and water are not available.</li>
<li>Stay home from class and work if you’re sick.</li>
<li>Avoid people who are sick.</li>
<li><strong>Get a flu shot – it’s not too late to be protected</strong>.</li>
<li>Clean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces and objects.</li>
</ul>
