<h3>Fall 2020 Planning</h3>
<p>University officials are collaborating with public health experts to implement plans for the resumption of in-person instruction this fall. We look forward to being together again soon. In the meantime, the University's Emergency Response Team is working hard to mitigate risk&nbsp;and&nbsp;prepare for a safe return to campus.</p>

                <p>Final exams will be administered online in order to mitigate the risk associated with holiday travel. If students and employees travel during the Thanksgiving holiday and spend time with extended family and friends, there is an increased chance that the virus will be spread to the campus community when they return.

        <button class="accordion" id="purple" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#purple5">What is COVID-19?</button>
            <div class="collapse" id="purple5">
                <p>Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a newly identified respiratory illness caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. First detected in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, cases of COVID-19 have been confirmed in <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/locations-confirmed-cases.html#map" target="_new">more than 100 locations</a> around the world, including the U.S., Canada, South Korea, Iran, Italy and Japan. </p>
                <p>According to the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-nCoV/summary.html" target="_new">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC),</a> human coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that are common in people and usually cause mild to moderate symptoms. Previous coronavirus outbreaks have included Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS).</p>
            </div>

        <button class="accordion" id="purple" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#purple6">How does COVID-19 spread?</button>
            <div class="collapse" id="purple6">
                <p>Because COVID-19 is a newly identified disease, research is still underway about how it is transmitted and how easily the virus spreads from person to person. The virus is believed to spread through respiratory droplets when an infected person coughs or sneezes, close personal contact (within about six feet) and by touching contaminated objects or surfaces.</p>

                <p>
                    Similar to influenza and the common cold, symptoms of COVID-19 may include the following:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Fever </li>
                        <li>Cough </li>

                    </ul>
                
                <p>Symptoms of COVID-19, which range from minor illness to severe pneumonia, can appear two to 14 days after initial exposure. </p>

            <div class="collapse" id="yellow26">
                <p>All employees working on campus (regardless of frequency) are required to wear a face covering when in campus buildings and when social distancing is not possible, except when:</p>
                <ul>
<li>It would create an unsafe condition to operate equipment or complete a task.</li>
<li>You are alone in a room (e.g. your office). In the event someone enters the room then you would be required to put on your face covering.</li>
<li>You are alone in a vehicle.</li>
<li>You are actively eating or drinking.</li>
<li>You have a documented medical condition or disability</li> </ul>
<p>Employees are permitted to wear their own mask, upon approval of their supervisor. The mask cannot include offensive or derogatory words or imagery. The mask is to fit snugly but comfortably against the side of the face, covering the nose and mouth. The mask should allow for breathing without restriction.</p>
<p>Employees will be responsible for laundering their own cloth masks daily.</p>
<p>Employees that do not have a face covering, should contact Safety & Risk Management to receive one at no cost to them. The University has also ordered EU branded masks that will be distributed to all employees once the order has arrived.</p>
    <p>Employees are also expected to self-monitor their health, including taking their temperature daily before arriving on campus. This guidance applies to both represented and non-represented University employees, contractors and students.</p>
                <p>COVID-19 Workplace Safety Guidance is available <a href="https://www.edinboro.edu/directory/offices-services/ehs/PASSHE-COVID-19-Workplace-Safety-Guidance-REVISED-4-17-20.pdf?language_id=1" target="_new"> here</a>.</p>

Please contact your supervisor for details on the exceptions.</p>
                <p>The Student Government Association (SGA), a separate 501c3, has decided to follow the University’s lead on travel restrictions. The SGA has announced that it will freeze travel budgets, as well as the use of the association’s vehicles.</p>

     <h4>University Measures</h4>

        <div class="collapse" id="bluepanel24">
            <ul>
                <li>EU’s Emergency Response Team, which includes members of the Executive Leadership Team and representatives from Student Health Services, Facilities, Campus Police and Safety and Risk Management, have been monitoring news about the virus since January to ensure the ongoing safety of the Edinboro community. </li>
                <li>An incident-specific Coronavirus Response Protocol was developed based on county, state and federal guidance to serve as a supplement to the University’s Pandemic Plan.</li>
                <li>Trained health professionals from Student Health Services are maintaining consistent contact with regional and state health organizations and are prepared to assess and respond in accordance with established protocols from the Center for Disease Control (CDC) and World Health Organization. </li>
                <li>Regular campus-wide updates are being issued with comprehensive information about COVID-19 and tips for preventing the spread of germs and respiratory viruses.</li>
                <li>Student Health Services continues to screen students with symptoms of respiratory illness for recent international travel and will utilize the isolation room in Ghering Health and Wellness Center if deemed necessary. </li>
                <li>Facilities staff has installed and is maintaining hand sanitizers in all buildings. </li>
                <li>In addition to following enhanced flu season protocols, Facilities staff members continue to routinely clean buildings and disinfect high-touch surfaces such as doorknobs, light switches, countertops, etc. </li>
                <li>Based on the recommendation from the Center for Disease Control (CDC) that all higher-education institutions should consider postponing or canceling all international programs, Edinboro University officials have canceled all university-affiliated international travel programs through the end of May. Non-essential business and University-related domestic travel has also been canceled for all students, faculty and staff, with very few exceptions.  </li>
                <li>As a precautionary health measure, a temporary suspension of face-to-face courses began Monday, March 16, and will continue through the end of the semester. Online undergraduate and graduate courses will continue as scheduled during that time. Beginning March 23, all in-person courses will transition to an online format (email, Zoom and/or D2L).</li>

            <p>Dear Students,</p>
            <p>Thank you for your patience while we carefully prepared for your return to campus. We wanted to ensure we are doing everything possible to protect your health and safety.</p>
                <p>Your wait is over. I write today to share Edinboro University’s plans for the fall semester. 
The following details comply with Pennsylvania Department of Health guidelines, released last week, and also fall within the framework provided by Pennsylvania’s State System of Higher Education, approved on June 10 by the System’s Board of Governors.</p>  
            <p>Now for the specifics.</p>

            <p><ul>
          <li><b>The fall semester will begin on Monday, Aug. 17 – a 
          week earlier than originally scheduled.</b></li>
          <li>Move-in for residential students will be staggered, 
          beginning the week of Aug. 10, to allow for social distancing.</li><br>
          <li><b>The last day of classes will be Friday, Nov. 
          20 – the Friday before Thanksgiving.</b></li><br>
          <li>Final exams will be administered online during the week of 
          Nov. 30.</li><br>
          <li>Since finals week will be online,  Housing 
          and Dining Services billing will be prorated 
          to reflect that adjustment.</li><br>

      <p>  
        <span style="margin: 0in 0in 8pt; line-height: 18px; font-size: 11pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">
          The University will follow guidelines established 
        by the PA Department of Health, the Erie County Health 
        Department, and the CDC, as stated earlier. Highlights 
        of the guidelines include:</span>
       </p>
       <p>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Wear A Face Covering.</b> Masks, shields, or related
          coverings must be worn in all campus buildings and
          where social distancing is not possible (this applies
          to all students, faculty and staff). <b>The University 
          will provide one face covering for each student.</b> 
          Details on distribution of masks will be shared at
          a later date.  Students are expected to bring 
          additional protective face coverings to campus 
          with them.</li><br>
          <li><b>Practice Social Distancing.</b> Social distancing
          rules must be followed, which means maintaining 
          a six-foot distance from others, avoiding large 
          gatherings, limiting the number of passengers in
          an elevator, restricting visitors in the residence
          halls, and avoiding sharing of food and drink.</li><br>
          <li><b>Monitor Your Health.</b> Aside from the testing 
          to be put in place by the University, all faculty,
          staff and students are required to self-monitor
          their health daily prior to coming to campus or
          attending class.  If they experience any 
          <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/symptoms-testing/symptoms.html" style="color:#bb131a;">symptoms of COVID-19</a>, 
          they should stay home and contact their healthcare
          provider. Students should also contact  
          Edinboro’s Ghering Health and Wellness Center 
          for medical assistance and to help the university 
          in monitoring campus health and safety. </li><br>
          <li><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/prevention.html" style="color:#bb131a;"><b>Practice Proper Hygiene.</b></a>
          Wash hands often with
          soap and water for at least 20 seconds or apply 
          hand sanitizer. Avoid touching nose, mouth and eyes.
          Cover coughs and sneezes with a tissue or your 
          elbow and immediately wash hands or apply hand 
          sanitizer. Discard tissues in lined trash cans.</li>
        </ul>
</p>
<h4 style="font-weight:normal;">Athletics</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>University Athletics will adhere to guidance
          provided by the NCAA and the Pennsylvania State
          Athletic Conference.  Information will be forthcoming
          as it becomes available.</li><br>
        </ul>
        
        <h4 style="font-weight:normal;">Events</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>The Pennsylvania Department of Health allows for
          events with crowds up to 250, provided social 
          distancing requirements can be met in Pennsylvania
          counties that are in the Green Phase, as designated
          by Gov. Tom Wolf.  Decisions on events will be made
          on a case-by-case basis, depending on crowd size and
          availability of adequate space.</li><br>
        </ul>
</p>
 <h4 style="font-weight:normal;">Billing</h4>
        
          <p>Fall semester bills will be sent out from the University in mid-July.</p>

        <h4 style="font-weight:normal;">New Student Orientation</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>New Student Orientation (NSO) will be a virtual
          event this year, and all new incoming students are 
          required to attend.</li><br>
          <li>NSO will open with an online overview of the 
          Edinboro experience, which will be made available 
          on June 16.  Students are encouraged to take advantage
          of this preview providing a broad look at what the 
          university has to offer.</li><br>
          <li>The main NSO event will provide incoming students
          an opportunity to hear from current Edinboro students,
          faculty and staff, during one of two Facebook livestreams.
          These live sessions are scheduled for June 25 and
          July 9.  Topics to be addressed are based on student
          survey results.  Deposited students will receive a
          schedule of NSO events in their student email, so 
          be sure to check your email.</li><br>
          <li>Academic sessions will also be offered so that 
          students can learn more about their areas of interest. 
          To wrap up the NSO experience, students can attend 
          these Zoom sessions with academic leaders and 
          representatives from campus organizations – followed
          by virtual sessions with student orientation leaders.</li><br>

            <p>Dear Faculty and Staff,</p>
            <p>Below is some workplace guidance derived from the April 15 safety measures released by the PA Department of Health. The guidance was developed by the State System Environmental Health and Safety/Emergency Management Group to provide additional clarification on University and employee compliance. </p>
                <p>Effective Sunday, April 19, all employees working on campus (regardless of frequency) will be required to wear a mask except while working alone in an office or driving alone in a vehicle. Employees are also expected to self-monitor their health, including taking their temperature daily before arriving on campus. This guidance applies to both represented and non-represented University employees, contractors and students.</p>  
            <p>Please review the guidance carefully for additional details and direct any compliance-related questions to your supervisor or Jim Dahle, director of safety and risk management, at jdahle@edinboro.edu.</p>

            <p>Dear Students and Colleagues,</p>
            <p>The results are in – Edinboro University will postpone Commencement until the fall.</p>
                <p>We surveyed the roughly 650 undergraduate and graduate students expected to graduate in spring 2020 to find out their preference for Commencement. We had 547 responses, which is very impressive and an indication of the importance of this rite of passage. Nearly 76% of respondents voted for an in-person ceremony, even though it will be delayed. A date will be selected and announced as soon as we are confident about what to expect in the fall, given the changing nature of COVID-19.</p>  
            <p>Class of 2020, although your graduation ceremony is being postponed, you will not have to wait for your diplomas. They will be mailed to you during the week of May 11. When Commencement day comes, it will have very special meaning for all of us. The entire campus community will share your pride as you receive well-earned recognition for your hard work and perseverance.</p>
                <p>To the Class of 2020 and better days ahead!</p>
            <p>Sincerely,</p>

            <p>Dear Students, Faculty and Staff,</p>
            <p>I hope you are adjusting as much as possible to our new normal. I know the disruption to life as we knew it is difficult, but we will get through this. We had some sunshine this weekend and the buds are starting to appear on the trees, so there are signs of spring and better days ahead.</p>
                <p>I am writing with an update regarding the summer schedule. In keeping with Gov. Tom Wolf’s strategy to protect the health and safety of all Pennsylvanians, and to secure the safety of our faculty, staff, students and our broader communities, Chancellor Daniel Greenstein has directed all Pennsylvania State System schools to continue the suspension of in-person instruction through the end of summer. All summer classes will instead be offered via a remote delivery modality. The majority of Edinboro’s summer classes are already offered online, so we are prepared.</p>  
            <p>The chancellor has further directed that no in-person experiential learning occur through the summer 2020 months. This includes, but is not limited to clinical rotations, student teaching, internships and field experiences. Where possible, faculty and experiential learning supervisors should continue to provide remote learning opportunities for students.</p>
                <p>Finally, all face-to-face events (both academic and non-academic) scheduled or planned for the summer 2020 months will be canceled, postponed or moved to a remote modality.</p>
            <p>Rare exceptions to the above may be granted at the discretion of the president if it is deemed that the health and safety of campus and the broader community will not be placed at risk. It is difficult to imagine such a situation at this time, so exceptions are unlikely.</p>
            <p>I understand that to have a disruption expected to last a couple of weeks extend for months is disheartening. Nevertheless, these measures are essential to help curb COVID-19’s spread.</p>
            <p>I am grateful for your cooperation during these difficult times. I am quite certain that the persistence and grit at the core of who we are as a community will enable us to persevere and emerge all the stronger.</p>
            <p>Sincerely,</p>

            <p>Dear Edinboro Undergraduate Students,</p>
            <p>With the transition in course delivery as a result of the COVID-19 crisis, I wanted to inform you of two changes in our academic processes intended to give you greater flexibility this semester.  Those changes, addressed below, are: (1) an extension of the last day to withdraw from a course, and (2) the process for choosing Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory (S/U) Grading.</p>
                <p><strong>Extended Last Day to Withdraw</strong><br>
The last day to withdraw from a course is typically the end of the 10th week of the semester, which would be March 27 for this semester. Because of the extension of spring break for what had been face-to-face courses, and recognizing anxieties that may arise in taking your courses using a different method, we are extending the last day to withdraw from a course to 11:59 p.m., Monday, April 6. If you wish to withdraw from a class, you may do so until April 6 through your SCOTS account, using the alternate PIN you used to register for your spring classes. If you forgot this alternate PIN or need assistance, please contact Records and Registration, records@edinboro.edu. The usual $25 withdrawal fee will be waived between March 16 and April 6.</p>  
            <p>It is important to remember that withdrawing from a course may impact your satisfactory academic progress necessary to maintain your federal and state financial aid (grants and loans); the time spent completing your degree; athletic eligibility, and scholarship funds you may be receiving. Before making a decision to withdraw from a course, please consult your academic advisor and financial aid counselor to discuss the implications of your decision.</p>
                <p><strong>Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory (S/U) Grading Option</strong><br>
Under normal circumstances, students have the option to choose S/U grading during the first week of the semester. Given the unusual nature of the current situation, we will extend that date for undergraduate classes to 11:59 p.m., Monday, April 6.</p>
            <p>What does S/U grading mean? Typically, your faculty instructor assigns a traditional letter grade for your course performance (e.g., A, B-, C+). Under S/U grading, your instructor will still assign you a letter grade, but that grade will be converted to an “S” if your assigned grade is “C- or higher” or a “U” if your assigned grade is a “D+ or lower.” The S/U grade values do not impact your GPA, but you will only earn credit for the course if you receive an “S.” Effectively, a “U” is equivalent to an “F” grade but does not impact your GPA. Typically, the S/U grade option is not permissible for courses in your major, but will be permitted this semester because of the current crisis.</p>
            <p>Since the decision to withdraw from a course or to choose S/U grading may have important ramifications for your academic progress, it is extremely important that you discuss your decision with your academic advisor, among other support staff: academic support coordinator, financial aid counselor, athletic coach, whichever may also be relevant to your circumstances. Some important things for you to consider in making this decision:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>In certain majors, there are minimum grade requirements for major or related courses. For instance, Education programs require a minimum grade of “C,” so an “S” grade would not satisfy that requirement since the “S” allows for grades as low as “C-.“ It is important that you check with your academic advisor or the Academic Success Center regarding such requirements for your major.</li>
                    <li>If you are on academic warning or probation, receiving regular letter grades can assist you in obtaining the GPA needed to move you out of this status to good academic standing; however S/U grades will not impact your GPA.</li>
                    <li>If you are a student athlete, there are certain NCAA requirements that must be met in terms of credit progress and GPA in order for you to remain eligible to compete. Please consult with Mr. Todd Jay (jay@edinboro.edu) to discuss implications for your athletic status if you are considering the S/U grade option.</li>
                    <li>If you receive financial aid (federal or state grants or loans) or scholarships, your ability to renew this aid may be dependent on credits completed and GPA earned. In this case, you should consult with our Financial Aid office.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>How do you change your grading choice? If you wish to change one or more of your courses to the S/U grading option, you should log in to myEdinboro where you will find the icon in the academics section (top) of your icon tray.  Once you select the icon, you will be taken to a screen showing your course schedule for this semester. For each course, you should use the pull-down menu to choose either S/U or Standard Grade.</p>
                <p>If you do not wish to select S/U grading for any of your classes, no action is needed.</p>
                <p>Once you have made the decision to change your grading from standard letter grades to S/U, you will NOT be able to change it back after April 6. If you select the S/U option and want to change it back prior to that deadline, please email records@edinboro.edu.</p>
                <p>As always, I wish you well in your classes for the semester and hope that these options will help reduce some of your anxieties in this transition. Stay safe!</p>
            <p>Sincerely,</p>

            <p>Dear Students, Faculty and Staff,</p>
            <p>I hope that this message finds you and your loved ones safe and well. As I reflect on the past few weeks and look out my window on this gray, rain-soaked day in Edinboro, it is hard to believe how much has changed in just a short time. Our world, our country and our University have experienced many disruptions and a great deal of uncertainty in the face of this global pandemic.</p>
                <p>My thoughts are with you today as face-to-face courses resume in a virtual format and all classes are now fully online. I recognize that this transition to online coursework for the remainder of the semester has required and will require a great deal of flexibility and patience. Students are adjusting to a new way of learning. Faculty members have worked tirelessly to reconfigure their courses and master new technology. Staff are adjusting to a new way of working while continuing to provide resources that support the ongoing needs of our institution.</p>  
            <p>Please accept my sincerest gratitude for the incredible work that you all have done to continue the academic mission of this University. I deeply appreciate your efforts as together we navigate these extraordinary times.</p>
                <p>Over the next several weeks, I am sure that many of you will have questions regarding coursework, support services, degree completion and other academic-related topics. The University remains committed to your success, and we are here to help. Students are encouraged to reach out to their academic advisor or Dr. Philomena Gill, assistant vice president for academic and student success, at pgill@edinboro.edu with questions.</p>
            <p>Today, and every day, I am incredibly proud to be a member of this community of strivers. Your remarkable resilience and willingness to overcome these challenges together – while also balancing family responsibilities and adjusting to new ways of learning, teaching and communicating – have reinforced what it means to be a Fighting Scot. When this crisis passes – and it will pass – we will emerge united and stronger than ever.</p>
            <p>Sincerely,</p>

            <p>The University is in the process of reviewing student accounts and calculating potential refunds of housing, meals and the university center fee.  Refunds will be posted to the student’s account. Students with credit balances, after the refunds are posted, will receive an email with the following options:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Students with personal payments or private loan payments will be given the option to leave the credit on the account for a subsequent term.</li>

            <p>Dear Students, Parents, Faculty and Staff,</p>
            <p>Yesterday evening Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf ordered all non-life-sustaining businesses across the Commonwealth to close by 8 p.m. Thursday, March 19.</p>
                
                <p>Because we have taken proactive measures to protect the health and safety of our students, faculty and staff, Edinboro University is already in compliance with these statewide mitigation plans.</p>  
            <p>The majority of residential students have already moved off campus, and residence halls will be locked down at midnight on Sunday, March 22. Our University continues to provide life-sustaining services – grab-and-go food services, shelter and security – to a small group of students who have been granted permission to remain in on-campus housing due to extenuating circumstances. No visitors are permitted to enter residence halls.</p>
                <p>Although we have implemented protocols to limit the number of personnel on campus and prevent potential spread of COVID-19, there are a number of essential personnel identified for critical on-campus operations that must continue to support academic and residential functions. These functions include members of the president’s executive leadership team, student affairs, human resources, university police, information technology and facilities. Social distancing measures are being implemented to the extent possible by employees whose duties require a physical presence on campus.</p>
            <p>To further align with these state regulations, <strong>Baron-Forness Library will be closed beginning at 4 p.m. Friday, March 20.</strong> Information on the library’s plans for the continuation of services may be found on its <a href="https://libguides.edinboro.edu/covid19" target="_new">COVID-19 page</a>. Multiple internet service providers are also offering discounts. Information on those providers and discounts may be found on the University's COVID-19 page. Any student in need of equipment should contact the HELP DESK at 814-732-2111 to make arrangements.</p>
            <p>A number of students and parents have had questions regarding refunds for housing, dining services and fees. Following guidance from Pennsylvania’s State System of Higher Education, Edinboro will refund students on a prorated basis for housing, food services and the Pogue Student Center fee within three weeks via credits to the student’s account. Any outstanding credits will also be refunded to the student at that time. Refunds will be based on the period beginning Monday, March 16, which was originally scheduled as the first day of classes after spring break. See attached for full details of the System’s refund guidelines.</p>
            <p>Thank you for your continued cooperation as we work to keep our students, faculty and staff safe.</p>
            <p>Sincerely,<br><br>Guiyou Huang, Ph.D.<br>

            <p>Dear Students, Parents, Faculty and Staff,</p>
            <p>Pennsylvania's State System of Higher Education has issued additional guidance related to counseling services and student employment.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Counseling and Psychological Services</strong><br>
            During the COVID-19 emergency period, State System universities may provide counseling services via telecommunication only to students who are physically located in Pennsylvania. Edinboro students who are located in the Commonwealth can continue to access teletherapy by phone or zoom through Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS).</p> 
            <p>Due to state licensure regulations, Edinboro University is prohibited from providing counseling services via telecommunications to students located outside Pennsylvania. CAPS representatives are committed to the health and wellness of all Edinboro students, regardless of physical location, and will continue to offer facilitation of referrals for students currently located out of state. For additional information regarding teletherapy or referrals, please contact CAPS by calling (814) 732-2252 or (814) 732-2743.</p>
            <p><strong>Student Employment</strong><br>
            Based on State System guidance, only students who remain enrolled at Edinboro University full-time and are able to work remotely will continue to be paid for hours worked after April 5. Student workers should contact their supervisors regarding the possibility of remote work assignments.</p>
            <p>Edinboro University will issue updates as new information is received.</p>

            <p>Dear Students and Parents,</p>
            <p>We recognize that you may have many outstanding questions regarding housing and dining refunds, commencement and other topics. As this unprecedented public health crisis continues to evolve, our immediate focus has been on the health of our students and ensuring that everyone is safe as we continue the spring semester.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Housing and Dining Refunds</strong><br>
                Prorated housing and dining refunds are forthcoming. As we await specific guidance from Pennsylvania’s State System of Higher Education, members of Edinboro University’s Finance and Administration Division are working around the clock to calculate preliminary refunds based on each student’s unique situation. We will provide specific details in the very near future, once we’ve had an opportunity to review the anticipated System guidelines. In the meantime, here are a few updates from the Student Accounts Office:</p>  
                <ul>
                <li>If you are on a payment plan and your estimated balance is below $500, automatic withdrawals will be canceled for the final two spring 2020 payments.  </li>
                <li>There will be no late payment plan fees posted to your account. </li>
                <li>If your estimated balance is below $500, financial holds will be removed from your account.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Commencement</strong><br>
                Several institutions, including Penn State University, Rutgers University and the University of Pennsylvania, have canceled spring 2020 commencement ceremonies. We have NOT YET made a decision regarding commencement, but officials will continue to monitor the spread of COVID-19 and make a decision that is in the best interest of all of our students, faculty and staff who normally attend this important event. If/when the situation is significantly improved and safe, there will be an in-person commencement. Otherwise, the commencement committee will explore options for a virtual ceremony. Again, a decision has not yet been made.</p>
                <p><strong>COVID-19 Update</strong><br>
                Earlier today, Erie County Department of Health confirmed the first positive case of COVID-19 in Erie County, Pa. Sustained community spread is not yet present, but we encourage you to follow the social distancing guidelines outlined by the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html" target="_new">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a> (CDC).</p>
                <p>The best defense against COVID-19, influenza or any virus is to practice good hygiene etiquette. As a reminder, the CDC recommends the following:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/handwashing/" target="_new">Wash your hands</a> frequently with soap and water for 20 seconds or more, especially after using the restroom, blowing your nose, coughing or sneezing.</li>
                    <li>Use an alcohol-based sanitizer if soap and water are unavailable.</li>
                    <li>Avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth with unwashed hands.</li>
                    <li>Avoid close contact with people who are sick.</li>
                    <li>Always cover your nose and mouth with a tissue when you cough or sneeze, and discard used tissues immediately.</li>
                    <li>Clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces in your home.</li>
                    <li>Don’t share food or drink.</li>
                    <li>Stay home when you are sick.</li>
                    <li>Get the flu vaccination.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>We appreciate your cooperation and patience as we implement plans to keep the University and surrounding community safe. Please monitor your email for updates and check the University’s COVID-19 page regularly.</p>

            <p>Dear Colleagues,</p>
            <p>In response to this unprecedented public health crisis, Edinboro University’s Emergency Response Team (ERT) is actively monitoring updates from local, state and federal health organizations. The safety and well-being of our students, faculty and staff remains paramount as we do everything possible to prevent potential spread of COVID-19 and continue the important work of our University.</p>
            
            <p>The following actions are being implemented to ensure the health and wellness of the campus community:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Staff members whose duties require a physical presence on campus should continue to report to work during normal work hours until further notice. Social-distancing measures will be implemented to the extent possible.</li>
                    <li>Staff members who have the approval of their supervisor to work remotely may do so beginning Wednesday, March 18, at least through Friday, March 27.  We will keep you updated as new decisions are made.</li>
                    <li>Staff members who are not assigned to work either on campus or remotely by their supervisors will be placed on paid administrative leave beginning Wednesday, March 18, at least through Friday, March 27. We will keep you updated as new decisions are made.</li>
                    <li>Faculty members are permitted to work remotely or on campus as necessary.</li>
                </ul>	

             <p>Even as we transition courses to an online format, there are a number of critical on-campus operations that must continue to support academic and residential functions. Individual remote work decisions will be made at the divisional level, and your supervisor will be in touch by the end of business Tuesday (March 17) regarding those arrangements. We will keep you updated as new decisions are made.</p>
              <p>I have attached Pennsylvania’s State System of Higher Education University Operations Procedure/Standard Number 2020-43, which provides additional guidance on emergency remote work and telecommuting. I encourage you to review it. Supervisors should work with staff employees under their direction who will be telecommuting to complete the form in Appendix A. Once signatures are attached, please send to Human Resources.</p>
               <p>Information Technology Services (ITS) has compiled a comprehensive repository of resources for online learning and remote work in the myEdinboro portal. I encourage you to carefully review the information and reach out to ITS with any additional questions. </p>
                <p>As a reminder, free mental health and wellness services are available to employees and their families through the State Employee Assistance Program (SEAP) at 1-800-692-7459.</p>
                <p>These past few weeks have been filled with a great deal of uncertainty. Through it all, members of our community have stepped up to support each other with patience and compassion. I want to express my sincere gratitude for your tremendous efforts during these challenging times. We are a resilient, united community of Fighting Scots, and we will overcome these challenges together.</p>

            <p>Dear Students, Parents and Colleagues,</p>
            <p>Edinboro University will extend its online-only delivery of classes through the remainder of the semester. All face-to-face classes, which had been scheduled to resume on April 6, will be offered online through semester’s end. With the exception of students who have been approved for emergency housing, all students living on campus must remove their belongings from the residence halls by 4 p.m. Sunday, March 22 (see below for details).</p>
            
            <p>This decision was driven by our desire to do all that we can to ensure the health and safety of our students, faculty and staff and to prevent the spread of COVID-19. While there are no reported cases on campus, there are an increasing number of reported cases in Pennsylvania and across the country, and the virus continues to spread in many other parts of the world.</p>
            <p>In anticipation of some of your questions, we wanted to provide the following information.</p>
            <p><strong><u>Details Regarding Delivery of Online Courses</u></strong><br>
                For students who had previously been enrolled in face-to-face classes, your faculty member will be in touch this week with plans for online delivery. Nothing will change for those who had already been enrolled in online courses.</p>

            <p><strong><u>Schedule for Removing Belongings from Residence Halls</u></strong><br>
            <strong>All belongings must be removed from residence halls by 4 p.m. Sunday, March 22, with the exception of those approved for emergency housing.</strong> In order to ensure social distancing, as recommended by national and state health officials, we have established the following schedule hoping to prevent large groups of students from congregating in the residence halls at any given time. Students should leave their residence halls once their things have been packed. As you say goodbye to friends, please refrain from hugging or shaking hands.
            <p><strong>Tuesday-Saturday (March 17-21) – 10 a.m. to midnight<br>
            Sunday (March 22) – 10 a.m. to 4 p.m.</strong></p>
            <p>We understand that this is an abrupt and unexpected end to the academic year and, for seniors, your undergraduate experience. For that we are sorry. </p>  
                <p><strong><u>Student Mailroom Access</u></strong><br>
            Students will have access to the mailroom in the Pogue Student Center according to the schedule below.</p>
            <p><strong>Tuesday through Friday (March 17-20) – 8:30 a.m. to 3:30 p.m.<br>
            Saturday and Saturday (March 21-22) – 10 a.m. to 4 p.m.</strong></p>

                <p><strong><u>Removal of Art Supplies from Studios</u></strong><br>
            Art students living in the residence halls should remove their supplies from art studios when they are on campus to remove their other belongings. Art students who do not live on campus must pick up their art supplies by 2 p.m. Sunday, March 22. The studios will be open from 8-4 p.m. Tuesday-Saturday (March 17 through March 21) and from 8 to 2 p.m. on Sunday, March 22.</p>
            <p><strong><u>Clinicals/Practica/Internships/Student-Teaching</u></strong><br>
            All assignments will be discontinued through the remainder of the semester following the direction of Chancellor Dan Greenstein of Pennsylvania’s State System of Higher Education. Your internship/clinical/practica/student-teaching supervisors will be in touch regarding alternate learning experiences.</p>
            <p><strong><u>Fall Pre-Registration and Virtual Office Hours</u></strong><br>
            Your advisor will be in touch this week with information on virtual office hours, as well as with instructions for pre-registration.</p>
            <p><strong><u>All Other Events and Activities</u></strong><br>
            All other events and activities will be canceled through the remainder of the semester. A decision regarding spring Commencement will be made at a later date.</p>
            <p><strong><u>Refunds/Credits</u></strong><br>
            Information regarding a prorated refund or credit for housing and dining services will be forthcoming for those who normally would have lived on campus through the remainder of the semester.</p>
            <p>I understand that these are drastic measures and will have a profound impact on you, your friends and family, but in these challenging times, our “For Those Who Strive” brand line is quite fitting. I have tremendous confidence that our campus community has the grit, persistence and perseverance to get through this and come out the other side even stronger.</p>
            <p>Please watch your student email for updates and check the COVID-19 website regularly. We will prevail over COVID-19!</p>
                <p>Sincerely,<br>Guiyou Huang, Ph.D.<br>

                <p>Dear students, parents, faculty and staff,</p>
                <p>The Pennsylvania State System of Higher Education has issued a moratorium on all clinicals, practicums, internships and student teaching for ALL State System schools that have suspended face-to-face instruction. This includes Edinboro University.</p>
                
     
                <p>Effective immediately, undergraduate and graduate students in experiential learning sites, including professional placements, practica, internships, research internships, and clinical rotations should NOT report to on-site placements until face-to-face classes resume. For Edinboro, that restriction applies until April 6 at the earliest.</p>
     
                <p>If an accrediting and/or licensing agency has issued superseding guidance regarding those placements, then that guidance will be followed. In those cases, the student’s faculty supervisor will communicate that. At this time, Edinboro is not aware of such guidance for any of our programs.</p>
     
                <p>In the meantime, internship/clinical/practica supervisors will provide alternate learning experiences for students in these types of classes.</p>

            <p>Dear Edinboro Students, Parents, Faculty and Staff,</p>
            <p>You are probably aware that a number of colleges and universities across the country have made plans to adjust their operations as the situation regarding COVID-19 continues to shift.  While there are no reported cases of the virus on our campus, know that we have been closely monitoring its spread and will take every possible precaution to ensure the health and safety of our students, faculty, staff and visitors to our campus.</p>
            <p>Following are details of our plan. </p>
            <p><strong><u>Spring Break Extended Only for Those Enrolled in Face-to-Face Classes/Temporary Transition to Online Courses to Follow</u></strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Your spring break is extended through the week of March 16. During this time, faculty who normally teach face to face will prepare to teach online. Your professors will be in touch via email to share further details regarding online delivery, so check your student email account regularly.</li>
                    <li>During the weeks of March 23 and March 30, your classes will resume and will temporarily transition to online delivery.</li>
                    <li>It is our expectation that in-person classes will resume in their face-to-face format beginning Monday, April 6. Between now and then, we will continue to monitor the situation to determine next steps. We will keep you informed as decisions are made.</li>
                </ul>
            <p><strong><u>Students enrolled only in online courses (both undergraduate and graduate)</u></strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Classes will resume on March 16 as scheduled.</li>
                </ul>
            <p><strong><u>Clinicals/Practicums/Internships/Student Teaching</u></strong><br>
            
            Students in clinical/practicum courses, or serving as student teachers or as interns will adhere to their schedules, assuming their placement sites remain open and are willing to host students in these programs.</p>
     
            <p><strong><u>Students Expected to Live Off Campus Temporarily</u></strong><br>Any student wishing to live on campus during the weeks of March 16, 23 and 30 must have a justifiable reason for doing so and must make their request via this <a href="https://edinboro.campuslabs.com/engage/submitter/form/step/1?Guid=ccda282b-df6f-4bf8-a8f1-f59ddb149406">form.</a> The Library, Pogue Student Center, Van Houten Dining Hall and Ghering Health Center will remain open for those who must remain on campus.</p>
     
            <p>Technology will also be available in the library for any student who does not have access at home.</p>
     
            <p>If you need to recover any of your belongings from your residence hall, you may do so between 8 a.m.-3 p.m. Monday-Friday or 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. Saturday-Sunday.</p>
     
            <p><strong><u>Housing and Dining Refunds Available on a Prorated Basis</u></strong><br>
            Students will be refunded on a prorated basis for the time during which they will not be living in the residence halls and will not be using campus food services.  Details on refunds will be shared at a later date.</p>
     
            <p><strong><u>International and Domestic Travel</u></strong><br>Given the global reach of COVID-19 and the dynamic nature of the situation, University officials have decided to cancel ALL University-affiliated, international travel through the end of May 2020.  Non-essential business and University-affiliated domestic travel has also been canceled for all students, faculty and staff, with very few exceptions.  Employees should contact their supervisors for details on the exceptions.</p>
     
            <p><strong><u>SGA to Follow University’s Lead on Travel</u></strong><br>The Student Government Association (SGA) has decided to follow the University’s lead on travel restrictions.  The SGA has announced that it will freeze travel budgets for the rest of the semester, as well as the use of the association’s vehicles.</p>
     
            <p><strong><u>Athletics</u></strong><br>We have been following the lead of the NCAA regarding Athletics events and will provide updates if new information becomes available.</p>
     
            <p><strong><u>Events (Including the Presidential Inauguration)</u></strong><br>With the exception of Athletics, ALL events through April 5 will be canceled, including the presidential inauguration, which had been planned for March 20.  The inauguration will be rescheduled for some time in the fall, and we will inform you once a date has been selected.</p>
     
            <p><strong><u>Registration for Fall Classes</u></strong><br>Students, your academic advisors will be reaching out via email to provide guidance on registering for the fall. </p>
     
            <p><strong><u>Clinicals/Practicums/Internships/Student Teaching</u></strong><br>Students in clinical/practicum courses, or serving as student teachers or as interns will adhere to their schedules, assuming their placement sites remain open and willing to host students in these programs.</p>
     
            <p><strong><u>Financial Aid/Commencement</u></strong><br>The spring break extension for those enrolled in face-to-face classes will not affect financial aid nor will it impact Commencement, which is scheduled for Saturday, May 2.</p>
     
            <p><strong><u>Operations Unchanged for Staff</u></strong><br>At this time, there are no disruptions in operations planned for staff.</p>
            <p>We realize that many of these temporary changes are disruptive and decisions around them were not made lightly.  Please watch your inbox for updates and also visit our COVID-19 webpage for updates, an FAQ and important related information as we continue to navigate in these uncertain times.   We appreciate your patience and your support as we make arrangements that will allow us to proceed with confidence.</p>

            <p>Dear students, faculty and staff,</p>
            <p>As we continue to monitor developments surrounding coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19), we would like to share an important update.</p>

            <p>Earlier today, Gov. Tom Wolf confirmed the first two presumptive positive cases of COVID-19 in Pennsylvania. The cases were identified in Delaware County and Wayne County, both of which are in eastern part of the state. The cases are unrelated. As of today, there is no evidence of community transmission of COVID-19 in Pennsylvania.</p>
            
            <p>Cases of the respiratory illness have been confirmed in 70 countries, including the U.S., China, South Korea, Iran, Italy and Japan.</p>
            
            <p>Edinboro University does not have any reported or confirmed cases of COVID-19 at this time, but we are continuing to work with federal, state and local health organizations to prepare for any potential threat to campus.</p>
            
            <p>Should an instance of COVID-19 occur on or near our campus, the Emergency Response Team will follow the University’s established pandemic plan and response protocols that were created based on county, state and federal guidance. University officials are working with APSCUF on a plan to temporarily transition to online course delivery in the event of temporary suspension of in-person classes.</p>
            
            <p>The safety and wellness of our campus community is our top priority. Based on the recommendation from the Center for Disease Control (CDC) that all higher-education institutions should consider postponing or canceling all international programs, Edinboro University officials have canceled all university-affiliated international travel programs through the end of May.</p>
            
            <p>Symptoms of COVID-19 can include fever, cough and shortness of breath. Although there is no cause for alarm, we urge you to take basic precautionary steps to prevent the spread of germs and respiratory viruses.</p>
            
            <p>The CDC recommends the following:
                <ul>
                    <li><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/handwashing/" target="_new">Wash your hands</a> frequently with soap and water for 20 seconds or more, especially after using the restroom, blowing your nose, coughing or sneezing.</li>
                    <li>Use an alcohol-based sanitizer if soap and water are unavailable.</li>
                    <li>Avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth with unwashed hands.</li>
                    <li>Avoid close contact with people who are sick.</li>
                    <li>Always cover your nose and mouth with a tissue when you cough or sneeze, and discard used tissues immediately.</li>
                    <li>Clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces in your home.</li>
                    <li>Don’t share food or drink.</li>
                    <li>Stay home when you are sick.</li>
                    <li>Get the flu vaccination.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>The University will notify the campus community of any changes in protocol. Please contact <a href="https://www.edinboro.edu/directory/offices-services/ghering/student-health-services/index.html" target="_new">Student Health Services</a> in the Ghering Health and Wellness Center at (814) 732-2743 with any questions or concerns.</p>

            <p>Dear students, faculty and staff,</p>
            <p>Edinboro University’s Emergency Response Team (ERT) has been working with federal, state and local health organizations to actively monitor the spread of coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19). Cases of the respiratory illness have now been confirmed in 60 countries, including the U.S., China, South Korea, Iran, Italy and Japan.</p>
 
            <p>Given the global reach of COVID-19 and the dynamic nature of the situation, the Center for Disease Control (CDC) has asked higher-education institutions to consider postponing or canceling all international travel programs. Additional travel advisories and restrictions are likely as new cases are reported worldwide.</p>
             
            <p>Based on this recommendation and after careful consideration regarding the health and safety of our students, faculty and staff, <b>University officials have decided to cancel ALL university-affiliated travel programs through the end of May 2020.</b> This decision was made out of an abundance of caution.</p>
             
            <p>As Spring Break approaches, we urge you to avoid all nonessential travel.</p>
             
            <p>Whether for studying or leisure, global travel carries a number of potential risks. According to the CDC, international travelers may face unpredictable circumstances while abroad, including challenges in returning to the U.S. and difficulties accessing health care.</p>
             
            <p>The health and safety of our campus community is our highest priority. If you are planning to travel this semester (either domestically or internationally), we ask that you complete the <a href="https://portal.edinboro.edu/adminoffices/financeadministration/ehs/Pages/Travel-Form.aspx" target="_blank">Spring 2020 Travel Form</a>.</p>
             
            <p>Although there is no current threat to the Edinboro community or the region, the ERT is proactively managing preparedness efforts to best ensure the safety and well-being of our campus. We will continue to assess the situation and provide updates as necessary.</p>

            <p>Dear students, faculty and staff,</p>
            <p>University officials, in cooperation with the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-nCoV/index.html" target="_blank">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)</a>, are continuing to monitor news about the coronavirus disease 2019, or COVID-19. First detected in Wuhan, China, the respiratory disease, which is caused by the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), has now been detected in 37 locations internationally.</p>
 
            <p>The immediate health risk to the general U.S. public is still considered low at this time. Although the COVID-19 poses no current threat to the Edinboro community or the region, the University is taking proactive steps to ensure the health and well-being of our campus community.</p>
 
            <p>In accordance with the University’s established pandemic plan, members of our Emergency Response Team (ERT) and Student Health Services representatives have been in regular communication with the Pennsylvania <a href="https://www.health.pa.gov/topics/disease/Pages/Coronavirus.aspx" target="_blank">Department of Health</a>, the State System and other officials regarding preparedness efforts. The ERT will continue to work closely with members of the campus community to ensure continuity of classes should a threat to campus safety occur.</p>
 
            <p>This information is being shared to keep you informed about the University’s preparedness efforts and so that you may exercise caution in the event that you are planning to travel during spring break.</p>
 
            <p><b>Additional Information:</b>

            </p>
 
            <p>Although there is no cause for alarm regarding a potential COVID-19 outbreak on our campus, we should always take basic precautionary steps to prevent the spread of germs and respiratory viruses.</p>
