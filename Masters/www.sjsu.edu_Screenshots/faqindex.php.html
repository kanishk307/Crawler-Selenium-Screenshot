                              confirmed COVID-19. There is much more to learn about the transmissibility, severity,

                              either distributed or online. The division of Academic Affairs is providing additional
                              support and training to assist faculty and teaching associates, as applicable, with
                              distributed or fully online modalities. Where fully online means that all course material
                              is delivered through an online format, a distributed class may include aspects, such
                              as synchronous live lectures delivered from one’s office or distributed materials
                              that are returned to the instructor via a variety of modalities. This provides maximum
                              flexibility to each instructor within the confines of this very challenging public

                           </p>
                           
                           <h3>Keep Meeting URLs Private</h3>
                           
                           <p>Don’t share them anywhere that’s accessible to the public. Just keep it to the group
                              of people you’re sure you want to be there.
                           </p>
                           
                           <h3>Keep Meeting Passwords On</h3>
                           
                           <p>These are on by default, so all you have to do is put in a password when prompted
                              and leave them on.
                           </p>
                           
                           <h3>Lock Your Meetings</h3>
                           
                           <p>When a meeting is locked, no one can join. Learn how on the <a href="https://comm.sjsu.edu/kU0GE0J007K02KMQk30W10Q">SJSU IT Securing Zoom Meetings</a> page.
                           </p>
                           
                           <h3>Double-Check Your Zoom Google Calendar Invites</h3>
                           
                           <p>If you add a Zoom meeting to your calendar or create a Zoom meeting in your calendar
                              using the Zoom Plug-in, the calendar entry may include the Zoom meeting password.
                              Depending on your settings, this may expose the password to anyone who views your
                              calendar. Make your calendar entry private or edit the entry to remove the Zoom meeting
                              password.

                              are asked to continue their professional work through telecommuting, if applicable.

                              Due to the Shelter-in-Place order, some of the buildings the fees support are closed
                              or operations are limited/restructured. As the order lifts, SJSU will evaluate how

                              also ask your servicer about alternative repayment plans.

                           <p>You should still be careful about how you use your credit cards because they have
                              some of the highest interest rates of any financial tool, but if used carefully, they
                              can still be useful during emergencies. If you’re experiencing unforeseen changes
                              to your income, call your credit card companies - they may be willing to work with
                              you on arranging alternative payment plans or waiving late fees. Visit <a href="https://creditcards.usnews.com/articles/what-the-coronavirus-means-for-your-credit-cards">U.S. News: What the Coronavirus Means for Your Credit Cards</a> for more information.

                           <p>Classes may be taught remotely in many different ways. For example, some classes may
                              keep meeting at the same time as they do now but use technology (such as Zoom) to
                              deliver lecture material. This is called “synchronous instruction.” In other cases,
                              the class may move toward self-paced work that does not require meeting at a specific
                              time (this is called “asynchronous instruction”). Faculty members will be communicating
                              with students about the requirements of each individual class.

                              None of these courses will be offered in-person.

                           <p>To be successful remote learners, students must practice a bit more self-discipline
                              and initiative. Without your classmates or instructor physically present, you might
                              feel disengaged during a lecture. Also, courses using tools for remote learning may
                              challenge you to work with your classmates in virtual break out rooms or other online
                              spaces.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p>With that in mind, it is important to log-in to courses often, track requirements,
                              and set calendar reminders. Because your instructors have changed to remote instruction
                              in the middle of the semester, you should pay particular attention to any changes
                              to the course syllabus and requirements. You may also find it helpful to complete
                              any online coursework during the times you have typically set aside for your homework.
                              Remember, while you can learn from anywhere, courses taught via online or remote instruction
                              aren’t easier than their face-to-face versions.
