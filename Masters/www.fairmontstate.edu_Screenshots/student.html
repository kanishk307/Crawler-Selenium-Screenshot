	<h2><strong>An SGA Update Following COVID-19</strong></h2>
	</dt>
	<dd>
	<p>Students,</p>

	<p>SGA wants to congratulate the class of 2020 on successful graduation and extend warm regards to the rest of the student body finishing a rather unusual semester. Additionally, we would like to update you on the final business of SGA for the 2019-2020 academic year.</p>

	<p>SGA concluded its final virtual meeting of the year on April 23, 2020. Following the emergence of the COVID pandemic, a wrench was thrown into the traditional SGA timeline. Here is some information regarding our last two meetings and the beginning of next semester.</p>

	<p>On April 9, following a virtual meeting of the SGA, our members voted on and passed a resolution to hold elections at the beginning of the fall term. SGA had previously released information about the timeline of the new elections. Additionally, we posted said information on our website. However, as you all know, the Fall 2020 semester has been moved up. It will begin on August 10. As a result, SGA has also moved up its election timeline a week. The website has been updated accordingly. The new timeline is as follows:</p>

	<p><strong>*Election Timeline*</strong></p>

	<p><strong>July 20</strong>- election packets will be available on the SGA website</p>

	<p><strong>Aug 10</strong>- candidates may begin campaigning</p>

	<p><strong>Aug 13</strong>- filing deadline; candidates must have turned in nomination forms virtually to SGA advisor (election packet will have additional information)</p>

	<p><strong>Aug 19 – 21</strong>- SGA elections</p>

	<p>To ensure there is no vacancy in the position of student representative on the Board of Governors, SGA has been in contact with BoG Chairwoman Yann. Our current representative will continue to serve on the Board until our election takes place. SGA does not want to see a lapse in representation on the Board due to COVID-19.</p>

	<p>Again, SGA’s first priority and responsibility are to the students it serves. We hope you are all well and healthy, and we look forward to seeing you on campus in August. Please keep an eye out for more updates and information from SGA as the new semester approaches.</p>

	<p>Sincerely,</p>

	<p>Tyler Keller, SGA President</p>

	<h2><strong>Fall 2020 Residence Hall Move-In Information</strong></h2>
	</dt>
	<dd>
	<p>Dear Residence Hall Students:</p>

	<p>We are so excited to announce Move-In 2020! We cannot wait to see you all on campus this fall. That said, COVID-19 has changed the way we look at everything, including Move-In. So, we have reimagined Move-In to be as safe as possible for you, our students, and for the faculty and staff on campus.</p>

	<p>Keeping in line with the Governor’s guidelines and local health official’s recommendations, we have created a move-in system that should maximize social distancing while you are moving your belongings into the residence halls.</p>

	<h3><strong>MOVE-IN PROCESS</strong></h3>

	<p>To maximize social distancing for your own health and safety, as well as for the health and safety of others, students will be required to register for a move-in appointment. No more than 30 students will be permitted to register for any given time-frame on campus. Your appointment time will allow you up to 2 hours to move all of your belongings into your residence hall and to exit campus.</p>

	<p>We are requesting that <strong>in-state students</strong> register to move-in on July 31- August 5. Once you drop off your items, you will be required to vacate campus until later in the week. We want to ensure that you are coming in contact with as few people as possible during this move-in process. Students will be permitted to return to campus starting August 6 as listed below:</p>

	<ul><li>New Students with the last name starting with letters A-K: August 6, 2020, starting at 8 a.m.</li>
		<li>New Students with the last name starting with letters L-Z: August 7, 2020, starting at 8 a.m.</li>
		<li>Upperclassmen with the last name starting with letters A-K: August 8, 2020, starting at 8 a.m.</li>
		<li>Upperclassmen with the last name starting with letters L-Z: August 9, 2020, starting at 8 a.m.</li>
	</ul><p>We recommend <strong>out-of-state and international students</strong> register for move-in on August 6 and August 7 as they will be permitted to remain on campus after dropping off their items on these days. Any guests that come to help on August 6 and August 7 are only permitted to be in the residence halls during that 2 hour time-frame.</p>

	<p>It is critical, in order for the move-in process to run smoothly, that you report to campus <em><strong>only during your scheduled move-in time-frame. If you do not arrive during your scheduled time-frame, you will not be permitted to access the residence hall. Please see below for instructions on registering for move-in.</strong></em></p>

	<p>In order to help protect those on campus, we are asking that you come to campus prepared to move your belongings into the residence halls as quickly as possible. Please keep in mind the following:</p>

	<ul><li>Move-In is an independent process. There will <strong>not</strong> be assistance on hand to help you carry your belongings. Feel free to bring a cart or buggy to help you quickly move your belongings as these will not be available to you.</li>
		<li>You are permitted to bring <strong>one person</strong> with you to help move in your belongings. If additional people come to campus, they will be required to remain in their cars and will not be permitted to enter the residence halls for any reason.</li>
		<li>A mask and gloves are required to wear during your move-in process. Students or guest(s) who do not wear masks or gloves will not be permitted to enter the residence hall.</li>
		<li>A health screening must be completed prior to entering the residence halls. More information about that is listed below.</li>
		<li>Wear comfortable shoes.</li>
		<li>Make sure you pack your items in a way that makes them easy to carry. We suggest sealed boxes or totes.</li>
		<li>You are required to be out of the residence halls by the end of your scheduled time-frame.</li>
	</ul><p>Anyone who is on campus outside of their scheduled time-frame <strong>will be asked to leave immediately. The health and safety of all those on campus will be taken seriously during this time.</strong></p>

	<h3><strong>HEALTH SCREENING</strong></h3>

	<p>Upon arrival to campus, all persons traveling with you must be health screened at the Wellness Tent. This includes taking your temperature and answering a questionnaire.</p>

	<p>The Wellness Tent will be set up in the gravel parking lot located across from campus on Locust Ave. All students must first report to the Wellness Tent for a screening. After passing the health screen, you will be permitted to go to your assigned residence hall to check-in and unload your belongings.</p>

	<p>At this time, you will receive your keys to your new home!</p>

	<p>If a student or any person traveling with the student does not pass the health screening, they will not be permitted to drop off their belongings in their residence halls. We are requiring these students to vacate campus and self-isolate off campus for 14 days prior to returning. Upon returning to the residence halls to move-in their belongings after self-isolation, these students will not be permitted to bring an additional person with them to move in their belongings.</p>

	<p>A Residential professional staff member will be located at each main entrance of the residence hall. This professional staff member can answer any questions you may have.</p>

	<h3><strong>HOW TO SCHEDULE YOUR MOVE-IN </strong></h3>

	<p><a href="https://fairmontstate.libcal.com/calendar/studentlife" target="_blank">You may schedule your Move-In time at fairmontstate.libcal.com/calendar/studentlife</a>.</p>

	<p>You will have the ability to register for ONE time-frame between the dates of July 31 and August 7. Make sure you register for a time that will allow you to come to campus, unload your belongings, and leave by the end of the allotted time-frame.</p>

	<p>Registration is simple. Select the time-frame that works best for your schedule and click “Begin Registration.” A form will populate for you to complete. We are asking for your name (no nicknames), email, the best phone where we can reach you if something should change, and your residence hall and room number. Don’t forget to check your housing application to verify your exact residence hall and room number for registering!</p>

	<p>Following your registration, you will receive a confirmation email. Please save that confirmation for your records. <strong>If you are still unsure how to register for move-in, feel free to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9q8JJ_-no1w" target="_blank">review a short instructional video by clicking here</a>.</strong></p>

	<p>If you do not register for a move-in time frame by July 20, 2020, you will be assigned a move-in time. We cannot guarantee that this will be before the first day of classes; it is imperative that you register sooner rather than later. Move-in time-frames are available on a first-come, first-served basis. For our students and families who are traveling from out-of-state, please feel free to secure lodging at local hotels. We will not offer any lodging on campus.</p>

	<h3><strong>ID CARDS FOR NEW STUDENTS</strong></h3>

	<p>Returning students will already have ID cards, but ideally, we would like to have New Students’ ID cards waiting for them when they arrive on campus. In order to do this, New Students will need to submit a picture for their ID card.</p>

	<p>For New Fairmont State University students, please follow the <a href="https://www.fairmontstate.edu/id-photo-upload-instructions" target="_blank">instructions linked here to upload an image</a>.</p>

	<p>For New Non-Fairmont State University students, please email a photo to <a href="mailto:CampusCardServices@fairmontstate.edu">CampusCardServices@fairmontstate.edu</a> from your official institutional email.</p>

	<p>For all new students, these images must meet the following guidelines:</p>

	<ul><li>Center your head with the frame. DO NOT tilt your head. Face the camera directly with full face in view.</li>
		<li>Use a clear image of your face. Do not use filters commonly used on social media.</li>
		<li>Have a neutral facial expression or a natural smile – keep both eyes open.</li>
		<li>The photo must be in color.</li>
		<li>YOU MUST have a solid background (white or off-white), NOT a dark background.</li>
		<li>No hats or sunglasses. However, if you need to wear a head covering, hat, or sunglasses for religious or medical reasons, please contact the Campus Card Services at the email above to make special arrangements and to verify the purpose.</li>
		<li>Make sure it is a JPEG file.</li>
		<li>The system is configured to use an aspect ratio of 509 : 680.</li>
		<li>The minimum size of the photo should be Width: 509 px. Height: 680 px.</li>
		<li>Pictures must be submitted before July 15, 2020.</li>
	</ul><p>If you are unable to submit your photo by this deadline, you will be able to get your ID made in the Falcon Center during your two-hour move-in time-frame. Either way, don’t forget to bring a photo ID with you to campus for check-in!</p>

	<p>We look forward to seeing you from a safe distance!</p>

	<h2><strong>CARES Act Emergency Grant Funds Application Now Open</strong></h2>
	</dt>
	<dd>
	<p>Fairmont State has received the first half of Coronavirus relief aid from the federal government. The Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security (CARES) Act enacted by Congress in March of 2020 will provide Fairmont State with limited emergency funds to assist students facing financial need as a result of COVID-19. If you are a current Fairmont State student with financial hardships as a result of COVID-19, and you are interested in receiving part of these funds, please review the list of eligibility before completing the request form at the link provided below.</p>

	<p>Based on the latest guidance available from the Department of Education, in order to be eligible to receive a CARES Act grant, you must be Title IV eligible. For the University to determine your eligibility, you must: *  </p>

	<ul><li>Submit a Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) for the 2019-2020 academic year by May 8, 2020, or have a 2019-2020 FAFSA already on file with Fairmont State University          </li>
		<li>Be eligible for Title IV aid (e.g. Pell, Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant, Work Study, etc.) for the 2019-2020 award year</li>
		<li>Be an eligible citizen or eligible non-citizen</li>
		<li>Be registered with the Selective Service (if born male)</li>
		<li>Not be in default on a prior student loan or owe a grant overpayment</li>

		<li>Be enrolled at least half-time (defined as 6 credit hours or more)</li>
		<li>Be admitted as a regular, degree-seeking student</li>
	</ul><p><em>*This information is based on the latest guidance available from the Department of Education and may not be the final update to how the government requires the University to distribute the funds. Fairmont State continues to seek guidance from the federal government and will notify students and families as soon as possible of any further changes.</em></p>

	<p>Fairmont State is committed to working with you to complete this process. If you have any questions please contact Financial Aid Services at <a href="mailto:financialaid@fairmontstate.edu">financialaid@fairmontstate.edu</a>.  Please include a  phone number and a good time to reach you if you would like someone to call you. </p>

	<h3><strong>CARES Act Funding Application</strong></h3>

	<p>If you are a current Fairmont State student who meets the above-outlined criteria and you are interested in receiving a CARES Act Emergency Grant, <a href="https://fsubehsci.sjc1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_eWMmy5rIKj6e6YR" target="_blank">please click here to apply</a> or <a href="https://www.fairmontstate.edu/coronavirus-aid-relief-economic-security-cares-act" target="_blank">go to www.fairmontstate.edu/CARESapp</a>.</p>

	<p>After submitting this request form, the Office of Financial Aid will review your information, contact you with next steps (if necessary), and make a final determination of your eligibility to receive CARES Act emergency funds. </p>

	<p>While the University will make every effort to accommodate all students facing financial hardships, due to the limited availability of CARES Act funds and the evolving nature of guidance from the Department of Education, submitting this request form does not guarantee approval for a CARES Act Grant. If the Office of Financial Aid cannot provide you with this type of grant though, we will make every effort to assist you through further guidance and support.</p>

	<p>If funding from the CARES Act allows for a second round of disbursements, Fairmont State will communicate that information to our students registered for Fall 2020 classes. </p>

We’ve received many questions asking when you will be able to return to campus to retrieve your items. I understand this is a concerning time and not having all of your items with you may leave you feeling anxious or unsettled. <u><strong>Given current events, we do not anticipate that students will be able to return the week of May 8-9 for campus move-out.</strong></u></p>

	<p>Please be assured that the University remains focused on maintaining the safety and security of all of our students including our residents and staff. We will announce a plan to safely allow our residents to retrieve their items as soon as it is safe to do so.</p>

	<p>Campus Housing remains closed and we continue to be in a stay at home order, per the Governor of West Virginia. We cannot move forward with reopening campus until this order is lifted and proper safety protocols are put into place.</p>

	<p>Students with belongings in the residence halls will receive communication as to when you may safely return to campus to retrieve your items. Again, <u><strong>given the current timeline of events, we do not anticipate that students will be able to return the week of May 8-9 to retrieve their items</strong></u>. We know this is inconvenient and challenging. I will continue to update you on a new move-out timeline and process, so you can make the necessary preparations. Move out will be coordinated in an independent and organized manner. </p>

	<p>If you are still having mail sent to your University address, please make sure that you have updated your on-campus address to your current residency, <a href="https://www.usps.com/manage/forward.htm" target="_blank">through the USPS website</a>.  This will ensure that you receive your mail and packages in a timely manner.</p>

	<p>Please know that while we are not together on campus right now, our entire Residence Life team is here for you. We can be reached at <a href="mailto:reslife@fairmontstate.edu">reslife@fairmontstate.edu</a> or at 304-367-4754.</p>

	<p>I can’t wait to have you all back on campus again soon.</p>

	<p>Sincerely, <br />
	Alicia Kalka</p>

	<h2><strong>Individual Course Withdrawal Extended to April 27</strong></h2>
	</dt>
	<dd>
	<p><strong>April 21, 12:05 p.m.</strong></p>

	<p>Students:</p>

	<p>As University Leadership continues to evaluate the impact COVID-19 is having on our students, we have decided to extend the withdrawal period (for one or more courses) to Monday, April 27, 2020.  You will have the ability to withdraw from one or more classes until close of business Monday by following the process outlined below.  Please keep in mind that dropping below full-time status (12 credit hours) could have negative effects on any future financial aid you may be expecting.</p>

	<p><strong>STUDENT COURSE WITHDRAWAL PROCEDURE</strong></p>

	<ol><li>Using your Fairmont State email (correspondence from personal email accounts will not be considered), contact your instructor or advisor to determine if this your only recourse at this time. There may be other viable options to withdrawing from the class if you were in good standing at mid-term.</li>
		<li>If you both agree, then the instructor will forward your email to the Registrar’s Office to request the withdrawal. You are not able to do the withdrawal through Felix since this is past the March 23rd deadline.</li>
		<li>If you receive financial aid, you should contact the Office of Financial Aid prior to dropping below full-time status to ensure you are not compromising your ability to receive aid for future semesters.</li>
	</ol><p>We hope this exception will help to alleviate some concerns you may have during this unprecedented time. Don’t forget that the Tutoring and Testing Center is available by appointment for students in a variety of subjects. For updated schedules and information about making appointments, please visit <a href="https://www.fairmontstate.edu/academics/tutoring-services">https://www.fairmontstate.edu/academics/tutoring-services</a>.

	<h2><strong>Making Blackboard Work for You</strong></h2>
	</dt>
	<dd>
	<p><strong>April 14, 10:00 a.m.</strong></p>

	<p>Students: </p>

	<p>We now have several weeks of experience in our new digital learning environments and want to be sure you understand the capabilities available to you through Blackboard. As many of you know, Blackboard is Fairmont State University’s official learning management system. It is used to provide students with regular updates on academic progress including grades, communicate directly with classes, share assignments, engage in discussions, and facilitate testing.  </p>

	<p>Even more importantly, Blackboard provides faculty with a way to monitor how well and often students are utilizing the platform for their courses.  By logging into Blackboard, your professor can see how often you log into class, when and how long you work on an assignment or a test, they can also answer your questions for you.  The time and amount of effort you commit to your academic work is often reflected in your grades. The depth of what you learn and understand, as well as the quality of your completed assignments, is a direct result of the level of engagement with your course.</p>

	<p>We know that learning to use a digital platform takes time. Please know that your professors are observing the amount of time you are working in your Blackboard class space and may contact you on how to increase or improve your engagement in their class. We understand our “new normal” is not optimal for some of you. We have heard your concerns related to internet access, family issues, solitude, and added stress. If you need help, I’m asking you to reach out and address any concerns you may have so we may work with you. If you need additional or specific assistance in your courses, please reach out to your professors and let them know that you are struggling with the digital learning format. </p>

	<p>Also, our Tutoring Center remains available for all students to receive additional help.  Tutoring by appointment is available for students in a variety of subjects. For updated schedules and information about making appointments, <a href="https://www.fairmontstate.edu/academics/tutoring-services" target="_blank">please visit the tutoring center website</a>. Or, you may also contact the Tutoring and Testing Center directly at <a href="mailto:tutoring@fairmontstate.edu">tutoring@fairmontstate.edu</a> with questions.</p>

	<p>If you wish to speak with someone about feeling lonely or stressed, about family issues or about anything else that is on your mind, please know that confidential counseling is still available to you. Confidential counseling services are available via secure video conferencing or by phone to students in most states. Please call (304) 333-3661 or email <a href="mailto:counseling@fairmontstate.edu">counseling@fairmontstate.edu</a> to schedule a consultation or appointment. </p>

	<p>At Fairmont State, your success is our top priority. We are here to navigate this new normal together.</p>

	<h2><strong>Required GPA Lowered for Renewal of Institutional Scholarships</strong></h2>
	</dt>
	<dd>
	<p><b>March 26, 1:45 p.m.</b></p>

	<p>In collaboration with financial aid experts throughout the state and in response to the current COVID-19 pandemic, Fairmont State University has lowered the cumulative grade point average (GPA) required for renewing 2019-2020 institutional scholarships for the 2020-2021academic year. Students will now be required to maintain a 2.75 cumulative grade point average instead of the 3.0 published scholarship grade point average requirement for scholarships for the 2020-2021 academic year.</p>

	<p>To renew the Out-of-State Neighbors, SOAR, Opportunity, and Promise Beyond Scholarships, students must complete 30 hours in the academic year which is comprised of the following semester Fall 2019, Spring 2020, and Summer 2020, in addition to maintaining a 2.75 cumulative GPA. </p>

	<p>This is a one-time exception to the 3.0 minimum grade point average requirement; therefore, for 2020-2021 all students will need to maintain a 3.0 cumulative grade point average to renew for 2021-2022.</p>

	<p>If you have any concerns regarding your completed hours or cumulative grade point average, please contact Financial Aid Services at <a href="mailto:financialaid@fairmontstate.edu">financialaid@fairmontstate.edu</a> or call us at 304-367-4141. While our office staff is working remotely, we are here to assist you in accessing and renewing financial aid assistance.</p>

	<h2>Housing Policy as of March 18, 2020</h2>
	</dt>
	<dd>
	<p><strong>March 18, 2020</strong></p>

	<p>Good Morning Residence Hall Students,</p>

	<p>Alicia Kalka, the Executive Director of Residential and Student Life, wanted to provide you some updates on Housing, to ensure you have current information. As you may be aware, there are confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the state of West Virginia. With the recent state of emergency put into place by Governor Justice and CDC guidance, students are not permitted in the residence halls at this time. For their health and safety, we have asked the students to prepare to leave the residence halls no later than 4 p.m. on Sunday March 22.  Students do not need to pack up all of their items but may do so if they choose.  As we do not currently know how this issue will progress, decisions have not been made regarding whether students will return to living on campus (this semester) or will be provided information on how to retrieve any items which may have been left behind. All rooms will remain locked to assist in the protection of personal items.  With the University work remote schedule and the State of Emergency, students need to go home (if they can). Our campus resources are very limited for our students. Again, this is in your best interest.</p>

	<p>Students who may be granted a special exception to stay on campus are: International, Homeless, Modify, Emancipated from Parents, and unhealthy home environment.  Students who need this special exception need to <a href="mailto:Alicia.Kalka@fairmontstate.edu">reach out to Alicia Kalka directly</a> or <a href="mailto:reslife@fairmontstate.edu">reslife@fairmontstate.edu</a>.  Dining options are being reduced. However, students who remain on campus will continue to receive dining options. The UT Market will remain open 24/7. For students experiencing food insecurity, the NEST will be available Monday – Friday, 11 a.m. - 1 p.m. and 4 - 6 p.m. Students will not be permitted to congregate at any of these locations.</p>

	<p>In response to the current COVID-19 situation and the transition to digital course delivery only, Counseling Services is preparing to move to telephonic and virtual/online methods of service delivery.  To utilize Counseling Services remotely, students must be currently enrolled and be physically in West Virginia.  Due to licensing laws, service cannot be provided to students who are physically in a different state, regardless of residency status.  The counseling staff will work with students who are currently out of state to find appropriate services at their physical location as needed. On-site meetings are suspended until on-campus classes resume.  Students may request a counseling appointment by calling 304-333-3661 or email <a href="mailto:counseling@fairmontstate.edu">counseling@fairmontstate.edu</a>, or Request an Appointment online. We are doing market research on programming efforts to keep our students engaged.  While we cannot engage our students in person, we are looking into “fun” and “social” programs through digital platforms.</p>

	<p>Some students and parents have inquired about receiving Housing and Meal refunds.  As we are involved in an unprecedented situation which is progressing daily, we continue to review and evaluate this financial concern and impact on students/families.  Our first priority continues to be student and campus community health and safety.  Once a decision is made regarding potential refunds, students will be notified.</p>

	<p>Please forward this along to any others who you feel may need to be updated. Residential and Student Life appreciates your support and understanding at this time. Please <a href="mailto:Alicia.Kalka@fairmontstate.edu">reach out to Alicia Kalka</a> if you have any questions or concerns.</p>

	<h3>COURSES</h3>

	<p>Beginning Monday, March 23 through April 24, all class instruction will be delivered digitally. All online classes and previous hybrid courses which have already converted to online instruction will continue as originally scheduled. We will continue to monitor the current situation and a decision will be made on whether we finish the semester through digital instruction or return for face-to-face instruction after April 24.</p>

	<h3>LIBRARY</h3>

	<p>We understand that some of our student population may not be able to successfully access digital instruction from home. Students who require access to equipment or broadband connections may use campus resources in the library.</p>

	<p>The library is closely monitoring usage in order to provide support to all users. <a href="https://library.fairmontstate.edu/about/hours" target="_blank">For the current library hours please click here</a>. It is, however, recommended that all students secure alternative means of accessing digital instruction as the University’s ability to continue Library services could be impacted as the pandemic progresses.  Please contact your professor with any questions or concerns.</p>

	<p>The online orientation, if taken prior to the beginning of a digital course, will assist in ensuring a successful online learning experience through Blackboard Learn. The online orientation will also familiarize you with your course structure so you complete your online course with greater ease.  The full online training should take between 30 minutes to1 hour to complete depending on your level of computer experience. You may complete the online orientation all in one sitting or in shorter segments, returning as needed, but it is suggested to complete the orientation as soon as possible but no later than March 23.</p>

	<h2>Nursing Clinical Schedule Updates</h2>
	</dt>
	<dd>
	<p><strong>March 14, 2020 8:55 p.m.</strong><br /><br />
	Because of health concerns and the changing nature of the COVID-19 pandemic, Fairmont State University has decided to move all class instruction to a digital delivery, which will also include clinical placements. This development means that beginning immediately (March 14th), you will not be going to the various clinical agencies as assigned; instead, alternate arrangements for clinical learning will occur. Faculty will meet next week to develop plans for theory and clinical in order for you to meet course outcomes. We will also be following recommendations from our accrediting agencies, ACEN and CCNE, regarding moving courses to different learning formats.</p>

	<p>The course faculty members will communicate the changes to you through Blackboard; please check it frequently, beginning Monday evening, March 16. It will likely take a few days before all faculty have this work finalized. We are also working on details regarding how to administer your HESI exams, should this apply to you.  </p>

	<p>I realize that you probably have many questions and maybe some concerns in this time of uncertainty. Please be assured that we will provide you with information as quickly as we can, but we will need time to coordinate and plan. If you have any questions or concerns, please e-mail your course professors or me at <a href="http://mailto:lclayton1@fairmontstate.edu">lclayton1@fairmontstate.edu</a>, and we will respond as soon as possible.  </p>

	<h2>Student Employment to Continue</h2>
	</dt>
	<dd>
	<p><strong>March 14, 2020 7:06 p.m.</strong></p>

	<p>Student employment should continue during the semester, when possible. Any questions related to your schedule, assignments, or employment status should be directed to your supervisor.</p>

	<p>Students who are unable or uncomfortable with returning to campus should contact their supervisors for options and further direction. The following options may be available for this purpose: (1) students who do not have a position conducive to a work-at-home assignment may be asked not to report and will not be compensated. (2) in cases where work-at-home assignments are appropriate and can be arranged, your supervisor will work with you to make reasonable assignments. (3) Options may be available for your student employment to be reassigned to a different area of the university. This will occur on a case-by-case basis and be coordinated by your supervisor.</p>

	<p>Students who are completing work-at-home assignments should <a href="https://www.fairmontstate.edu/files/Time%20Sheet%20-%20Hourly%20Emp%20-%20Kronos%20Updated%209-24-2019_1%5B2%5D.doc">fill out this timesheet</a> and send it to their supervisor each Friday. Supervisors will then need to enter a student’s time worked into Kronos.</p>

	<p>If you have traveled to any international location or domestically to a region with confirmed COVID-19 cases, please inform your supervisor before returning to work. Your supervisor may request that you work from home for a period of self-isolation. Please <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/locations-confirmed-cases.html">click here</a> for the CDC’s updated map of confirmed cases.  </p>
