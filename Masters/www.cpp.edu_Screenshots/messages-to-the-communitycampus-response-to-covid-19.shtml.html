                                            <p>Date: 3/10/2020<br/>From: Office of the President<br/>Subject: Campus Response to COVID-19</p>
<p>Dear Campus Community,</p>
<p>We know that there is ongoing concern about COVID-19, (2019 novel coronavirus).&#160;<strong>To date, Cal Poly Pomona does not have a confirmed case of COVID-19 in our own community,</strong> however, we continue to take proactive steps to protect the campus.</p>
<p>Over the past two months, we have been periodically updating you on developments related to COVID-19 and effective mitigation strategies to stem its transmission. These updates have been chronicled on our <a href="https://www.cpp.edu/safety/coronavirus/index.shtml">Health Alert</a> website.&#160;</p>
<p><strong>Staying Healthy</strong></p>
<p>We understand the uncertainty resulting from this rapidly changing scenario and appreciate the continued care and assistance that you provide to one another. We also reiterate the importance of taking all necessary precautions for yourself and the campus community such as washing your hands and staying home if you are sick.</p>
<p>This morning, Provost Sylvia Alva and Academic Senate Chair Phyllis Nelson <a href="https://www.cpp.edu/safety/coronavirus/messages-to-the-community/update-on-covid-19-response.shtml">communicated</a> to faculty that students who are sick and wish to stay home or have family obligations that require self-isolation may do so without requiring a medical note and without any penalties. Faculty will work with students to ensure continuity of the learning experience.</p>
<p>If you have fever and a cough or trouble breathing, <strong>AND</strong> you have traveled to an area with community transmission of COVID-19 or close contact with someone who has been diagnosed with COVID-19 in the last 14 days, seek medical care right away.</p>
<ul>
<li>Students: Contact&#160;<a href="https://www.cpp.edu/health/index.shtml">Student Health</a>&#160;(909-869-4000) or your healthcare provider. Call the Health Center&#160;<strong>BEFORE&#160;</strong>coming so that we can make appropriate arrangements to minimize the potential exposure to others.</li>
<li>Faculty and staff: Contact your primary care physician or health care provider. Call the provider&#160;<strong>BEFORE</strong>&#160;going to the facility.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Academic Instruction</strong></p>
<p>We are in active conversation with local health authorities and with the CSU Office of the Chancellor to assure that our preparations are in line with CSU policies and the current assessment of risk by the Los Angeles County Department of Health, the California Department of Public Health, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.&#160;</p>
<p>While health experts have stated the risk to California and our region remain low, nationally we have moved from containment to mitigation, and we are taking precautions and preparation measures in case the situation changes. Last evening, our sister campuses in San Francisco and San Jose announced plans to move to temporarily suspend in-person courses in order to transition to remote instruction. In light of these developments and to proactively take steps to mitigate transmission, we are working to increase the delivery of instruction via virtual tools.&#160;</p>
<p>Last Friday, the Provost and Chair of the Academic Senate issued a joint statement providing resources, tools, and support for faculty to assure instructional continuity in the event that our campus needs to make a change to our operations. I urge faculty to take efforts to assure that students can make appropriate academic progress if we alter operations. The <a href="https://www.cpp.edu/facultycenter/teaching-continuity/">Faculty Development Center</a> website has resources and step-by-step instructions on using many of the online tools.&#160;</p>
<p><strong>Travel</strong></p>
<p>Based on guidance from the CSU Office of the Chancellor, <strong>effective immediately, Cal Poly Pomona and our auxiliary organizations will suspend all international and non-essential domestic travel from now through May 31, 2020.</strong> The vice presidents and deans will make determinations on what constitutes nonessential domestic travel for their respective units and colleges and have the authority to make exceptions accordingly. Questions related to travel costs already incurred should be directed to Michelle Cardona at <a href="mailto:mdcardona@cpp.edu">mdcardona@cpp.edu</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Meetings and Events</strong></p>
<p>Absent any confirmed cases of COVID-19, Cal Poly Pomona is making every effort to sustain core mission activities. Many of our routine meetings and events including shared governance activities, athletic competitions, concerts and performances, may continue given a careful assessment of risk. <strong>However, we strongly encourage canceling or rescheduling events that are less essential or not time sensitive.</strong> We are currently evaluating meetings, gatherings, and events through the end of spring break. The President&#8217;s Cabinet and Deans, in consultation with faculty, staff, and student groups responsible for the events, will make decisions that will best serve our mission and our community&#8217;s health, safety, and wellbeing.</p>
<p><strong>Our Inclusive Community</strong></p>
<p>Ensuring an inclusive campus community is a core Cal Poly Pomona value. COVID-19 is not limited to specific national or ethnic groups. As Broncos, we need to support each other and should not presume that students or colleagues are at a higher risk due to their country of origin.</p>
<p>We will continue to update the campus regularly and as circumstances dictate. Likewise, up-to-date information relevant to Cal Poly Pomona can be found at our <a href="https://www.cpp.edu/safety/coronavirus/index.shtml">Health Alert</a> website. Questions on our response and preparedness can be sent directly to <a href="mailto:healthalert@cpp.edu">healthalert@cpp.edu</a>.</p>
<p>Thank you for your patience and consideration as we collectively work to keep our campus and our community safe and healthy.</p>
<p>Sincerely,<br/>Soraya M. Coley, Ph.D<br/>President</p>
