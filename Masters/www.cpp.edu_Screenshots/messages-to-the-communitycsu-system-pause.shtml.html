                                            <p>Date: 3/17/2020<br/>From: Office of the President<br/>Subject: Move to Virtual Instruction and Remote Work through end of Spring Semester</p>
<p>Dear Campus Community,</p>
<p>I appreciate your continued patience and steadfast commitment as we navigate the rapidly evolving circumstances related to the COVID-19 pandemic. <strong>While there are no confirmed or presumptive cases at Cal Poly Pomona,</strong> I want to communicate the actions that we are taking to assure the safety of our Bronco family and the larger community.&#160; &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</p>
<p>In light of updated guidance by the Chancellor&#8217;s Office, and recent announcements by California Governor Gavin Newsom and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention calling for greater social distancing and other preventative measures, we are taking the following actions effective immediately.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Our transition to virtual and/or remote modes of instruction will be in effect through the end of the semester.</strong> As was communicated to <a href="https://www.cpp.edu/safety/coronavirus/messages-to-the-community/remote-or-virtual-mode-of-instruction-for-all-classes.shtml">faculty</a> and <a href="https://www.cpp.edu/safety/coronavirus/messages-to-the-community/important-student-update-on-covid-19.shtml">students</a> yesterday by Provost Alva and Vice President Sullivan, <strong>this transition to remote instruction includes all classes</strong>, including lecture, laboratory, activity, and independent study classes beginning tomorrow, <strong>Wednesday, March 18</strong>. Students should communicate with their instructors for details specific to their courses, and visit <a href="https://www.cpp.edu/studentsuccess/accessing-services.shtml">Student Success Central</a> for additional information and resources.</li>
<li><strong>Spring Break will continue as scheduled (March 28 to April 3).</strong> Following Spring Break, classes will resume through virtual instruction on April 4 through the remainder of the semester.</li>
<li><strong>Effective March 18 and until further notice, Cal Poly Pomona employees who can do their work remotely should not come to campus, in consultation with their supervisor. </strong>In order to practice recommended social distancing, we will reduce the number of individuals who will need to be present on campus. However, most units will retain some physical staffing at a minimum level. Divisional Vice Presidents, Deans, Chairs and managers are further identifying critical campus functions, remote work options, and rotating schedules for office staffing. We are working to finalize temporary remote work agreements this week. Staff should work closely with their supervisor to address expectations and individual circumstances. Please reference <a href="https://www.cpp.edu/safety/coronavirus/messages-to-the-community/message-to-faculty-and-staff.shtml">specific instructions</a> for individuals who have underlying medical conditions and/or are 65 years of age or older.</li>
<li>University Housing Services and dining will remain open to serve those residents that require housing. <strong>However, residents&#160;are strongly encouraged to return home as soon as practical.</strong> Housing is in regular communication with residents regarding their options moving forward.</li>
<li><strong>The BRIC and the BSC are closed. The University Library will limit services except for those students needing access to computers or other equipment for virtual instruction.</strong> Social distancing measures will be implemented in all buildings that remain open.</li>
<li><strong>The university is postponing the May 15, 16, and 17 graduation ceremonies until we can ensure the safety and security of our students and their families and friends.</strong> We advise families not to make arrangements to come to the campus. We are actively looking at alternatives to celebrate our graduates in an appropriate manner. We understand that commencement is an important part of the Cal Poly Pomona experience and we want to honor our students&#8217; significant milestone.&#160;While the formal pomp and circumstance will not take place in May, we will work to create an experience that honors the commitment and sacrifice made by our students and families. We ask for your patience and understanding as we continue to find solutions during these unprecedented times.</li>
<li><strong>The University Police Department is paramount to the safety of our community.</strong> UPD will continue to patrol and serve campus while observing strict social distancing.</li>
</ul>
<p>&#160;I want to stress that while we move to remote means of continuing instruction and the business of the university, the campus is not closed. Essential functions to support continued teaching, learning, and student services will continue.&#160;</p>
<p>You understandably have many questions. Please be patient. Some questions won&#8217;t have adequate answers just yet, but please know that we are working to fully respond. I strongly encourage you to regularly check our <a href="https://www.cpp.edu/safety/coronavirus/index.shtml">Health Alert</a> website, where we will be posting the most up-to-date information and answers to frequently asked questions. Also, you can call our hotline at 909-869-2500 and visit Cal Poly Pomona&#8217;s <a href="https://twitter.com/home">Twitter</a>, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/calpolypomona">Facebook</a> and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/calpolypomona/">Instagram</a> accounts. We will also be providing frequent updates as new information becomes available. <strong>Please confirm that your contact information &#8212; your mobile number, most critically &#8212; is current in </strong><a href="https://www.cpp.edu/broncodirect/"><strong>BroncoDirect</strong></a><strong>, which will facilitate communication to our campus community.</strong></p>
<p>This is an unprecedented moment in the history of our university. The most important thing now is that we take the necessary steps to keep ourselves and each other safe and healthy. I urge you to continue to be compassionate and kind to one another while social distancing is in effect. It is critical that we follow the guidance of public health officials for our own sake and for the sake of our communities, but &#8220;social distancing&#8221; does not mean &#8220;social isolation.&#8221; We can and must reach out and support others. We can call loved ones. We can connect on social media. The physical distancing, as critical as it is, just means that the bonds of family, friends, and colleagues must be made stronger.</p>
<p>We are a resilient community and will remain strong during these challenging times.</p>
<p>Sincerely,<br/>Soraya M. Coley, Ph.D.<br/>President</p>
