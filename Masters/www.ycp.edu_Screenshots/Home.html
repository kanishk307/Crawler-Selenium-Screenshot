	<div class="content"><p>Dear Students:</p>
<p>York College is again accepting applications for the&nbsp;<strong>CARES Act Student Relief Fund grants</strong><strong>.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;In response to the COVID-19 situation, the federal government has provided resources to colleges and universities for expenses resulting from a disruption of campus operations.&nbsp;Part of the federal CARES Act is a direct grant program for students who are in need of emergency financial aid.&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>As a point of clarification; tuition, fees, job loss, or wage reductions do not constitute qualifying expenses according to the language contained within the Federal CARES Act.</strong></p>
<p>Purpose:</p>
<p>The CARES Act student grants are designated for “...emergency financial aid grants to students for expenses related to the disruption of campus operations due to coronavirus (including eligible expenses under a student’s cost of attendance such as food, housing, course materials, technology, health care, and child care)…”</p>
<p>Eligibility:</p>
<p>Only students who have or could be eligible to file a FAFSA may receive emergency financial aid grants.&nbsp;The criteria to participate in this grant program include but are not limited to the following:<br>U.S. citizenship or eligible noncitizen; a valid Social Security number; registration with Selective Service (if the student is male); satisfactory academic progress; and a high school diploma, GED, or completion of high school in an approved homeschool setting.</p>
<p>If you wish to be considered for funding from the federal CARES Act,&nbsp;<strong>please complete the&nbsp;<a href="https://ycp.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_0wDlJdxa21KHQK9">2019-2020 Federal CARES Act Grant Application</a></strong>.&nbsp;After completion and submission, the form will automatically be sent to the Financial Assistance Office for review.&nbsp;Please understand that funding is limited, and resources may not be available to provide the amount requested<strong>.&nbsp;</strong><strong>This application is for expenses during the time period of March 27 through April 30, 2020, and/or May 1, 2020, through May 31, 2020.</strong><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong><strong>Applications are due by June 12, 2020.</strong></p>
<p>If you have already applied and received a grant for the first time period (March 27 to April 30), please be sure that the expenses are for new expenses not previously submitted.&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us know if you have any questions by emailing&nbsp;<a href="mailto:financialaid@ycp.edu" target="_blank">financialaid@ycp.edu</a>.<wbr>&nbsp;</p>

	<div class="title">April 17, 2020 - Campus Community and Families</div>
	<div class="content"><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I am writing to provide information on the process for moving out of residence halls, and adjustments for housing, meal plans, and parking. I appreciate your patience as we have thoughtfully considered how to balance the needs of our students and families with our longstanding commitment to affordability and access.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Move-out Process</span></span></p>
<p>Residential students will receive instructions regarding the process for moving their belongings out of residence halls. The time period for move out will depend on the lifting of the stay-at-home mandates in Pennsylvania and other states, and the process will follow social distancing guidelines. Students will sign up online for a specific date and time to return to campus and move out.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Housing, Meals Plans, and Parking Adjustments</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Adjustments are being calculated individually and in consideration of any institutional funds that were awarded to offset&nbsp;those costs.&nbsp;</span><strong>Students will receive individualized communications regarding their specific account adjustments by May 1, 2020.&nbsp;</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Business Office will not be in a position to answer student-specific questions until after the individualized letters are received.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Adjustments will be made in the following ways:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">For students with current balances - Credits will be posted to student accounts to reduce the current bill.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">For graduating students - Refund checks will be mailed to the permanent address of students who have applied for Spring 2020 graduation and will have completed their degree requirements.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">For continuing students - Credits will be applied to student accounts to reduce the Fall 2020 bill.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">For parking, students will receive credit for 50 percent of the spring semester charges.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Adjustments for student accounts were determined as follows:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because residential students were essentially commuting during campus closure, their cost of attendance (COA) changed to that of a commuter student.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The adjusted COA was used to calculate the amount of institutional aid (merit and need-based) attributed to housing and meal plans.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The charges for housing and meal plans* were adjusted by the revised amount of institutional aid and then prorated based on the number of days residence halls remained open to the student (March 15, for most).&nbsp;</span></li>
</ul>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">*Full credit will be given for unused meal plan points.&nbsp;</span></em><em><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br><br></span></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I am looking forward to the day when we can all gather on the York College campus. Stay safe and healthy, and be kind to one another.&nbsp;</span></p>

	<div class="content"><p>To the York College Community:</p>
<p>With the decisions to close our York College campus and continue virtual instruction through the remainder of the academic year, we have completed the first phase of our response to the COVID-19 pandemic. None of the decisions I have made up to this point in time were easy, but each reflected my best judgement to ensure the safety and security of our Spartan community.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>I now have the opportunity to address the short- and long-term impact of this pandemic on the College.&nbsp; I know that you have many questions, especially about returning to campus to retrieve your belongings from the residence halls, about celebrating graduation, and about resuming face-to-face summer courses and friendships. Nothing would give me more pleasure than to see everyone back on campus; however, this is not up to me or my administration. Rather, it will depend on when it is safe for our community to do so. Maintaining social distancing and staying home will help us to reach this point.<br>I will keep you informed of decisions in the most timely manner possible.&nbsp;</p>
<p>My thanks to all of you for working with us during these difficult times. Please know that I recognize the many challenges that you and your families are facing because of COVID-19.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I wish all of you a happy and healthy Easter or Passover. Let this time of renewal and rebirth also be a time of hope for better days. While we may not be able to physically gather together, it is important to find a way, perhaps through technology, to share special moments with those you love.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>My thoughts are with all of you. Take care of yourselves and each other. We will get through this together.</p></div>

	<div class="title">April 9, 2020 - Campus Community and Families</div>
	<div class="content"><p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your student received this correspondence from our Provost, Dr. Laura Niesen de Abruna, earlier this week. I am sharing it so that you will also be aware of additional grading options.&nbsp;</span></em></p>
<p><strong>Message from Provost Niesen de Abruna:</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During the past two weeks, I have consulted with a wide variety of individuals to discuss grading for the Spring 2020 semester. In addition, I have reviewed what other institutions have decided to do. This past week, I used a survey to ask both the full-time and part-time faculty members and all of the students who are registered for the Spring 2020 semester about their thoughts on the pass/fail issue.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are a number of unintended consequences of going to a simple pass/fail system, including requirements within departments and from accreditors for a specific grade, other courses that require a grade of 2 or above to move to the next course, or scholarships requiring a specific GPA. </span><strong>Therefore, students should consult with advisors, as well as offices such as the Financial Assistance Office, to determine the impact that taking a Pass option would have on their personal situation.</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In order to offer some flexibility for grading this semester, we have decided the following: Faculty members will submit grades as usual to the Registrar’s office using the established deadlines. We are urging faculty members to be flexible and to give students the benefit of the doubt, especially in relation to the coronavirus. There will be many circumstances in which a grade of “I” (Incomplete) is appropriate. </span><strong>The course withdrawal date of April 10 will be extended over Spring Vacation until April 14. (Spring Vacation begins at 10 p.m. on April 8 and ends at 8 a.m. on April 14.)</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For one week following the posting of grades, students will have an opportunity to make some choices about their grades in each of their courses. If they wish to keep the grade they are assigned, they do not need to do anything. But they can also:</span></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Take a Pass if the grade assigned is 2 or above</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Take a Low Pass if the grade is 1</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Take the designation of NC, which means no credit. This course will not be counted as an F and will not be counted in the GPA. To earn credit for these courses, they will need to be retaken.</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once the grades are entered, they cannot be changed except via a specific appeal. More information about the process will be forthcoming in an additional email.</span></p>

	<div class="content"><p>As I indicated in my earlier correspondence, students and families may have questions with regard to the closure of campus for the remainder of the spring semester. I have gathered information on the following topics, which have been the focus of many questions received by me and my colleagues.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Residence Hall Move Out</span><br>The College is developing a plan for students to move out of residence halls. We must comply with state and federal mandates that are now in effect in York and a large number of other states and municipalities. These are in place to ensure the health and safety of our communities, and include a stay-at-home mandate, the extended social-distancing requirement, and the shutdown of all non-life-sustaining businesses. In addition, the number of COVID-19 cases continues to increase exponentially throughout Pennsylvania. Because of these circumstances, we must delay implementing our plan and will contact students with a schedule when conditions allow. Campus Safety continues to patrol 24/7 to ensure that residence halls are secure. Until you are notified, do not return to campus to retrieve items.<br><strong>Contact:&nbsp;<a href="mailto:residencelife@ycp.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">residencelife@ycp.edu</a></strong><br>&nbsp;<br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Room and Board Adjustments</span><br>We appreciate that students and families are being affected by economic conditions created by COVID-19.&nbsp;We are currently exploring adjustments to fees for room and board for students who cannot access the residence halls or the dining facilities during campus closure. We are evaluating options, which in most cases are complicated by financial aid implications.&nbsp;Once the review is complete,&nbsp;we will communicate with each affected student.

	<div class="title">March 30, 2020 - Campus Community and Families</div>
	<div class="content"><p>I would like to start this note by thanking the entire York College community for making challenging adjustments throughout the past few weeks. Our faculty have moved quickly to provide online and virtual instruction and advising. Students have adapted, but obviously miss the connection to campus. Our employees are also working remotely and/or assuming other work assignments. None of this has been easy, and I am proud of the way that we have supported each other to ensure that we continue to fulfill our mission.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The current situation in Pennsylvania has not improved. The Governor's closure of non-life-sustaining businesses continues, and his issuance of a stay-at-home order for some Pennsylvania counties now includes York County. These mandates reflect continuing efforts to “flatten” the COVID-19 growth curve through social distancing. Just yesterday, President Trump expanded social distancing guidelines until April 30, 2020.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Because of these current circumstances, I have made the decision to continue online/virtual instruction throughout the rest of the spring semester</strong>.&nbsp;<strong>The York College campus will remain closed to students, visitors and those employees who are not performing essential on-campus functions. All College-sponsored events (on and off campus) scheduled before the end of the semester (May 18, 2020), will be canceled or postponed. Unfortunately, this includes the postponement of our May 16 commencement exercises, which will need to be rescheduled. I remain committed to celebrating the accomplishments of our graduates.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>I know that you have many questions with respect to the impact of the continued York College campus closure. For students these include, but are not limited to, the ability of residential students to move their belongings from residence halls, adjustments for unused room and board fees, successful completion of courses and grading, and planning for summer courses.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For campus employees, questions arise as to how to comply with the stay-at-home order, and compensation beyond April 15. I have elected to address these concerns in separate communications. Importantly, I ask for your patience as we work through these issues. My leadership team has been meeting remotely every day to respond to this. We will provide more information as soon as we can.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is not the way any of us expected to finish out the semester. It is important to continue following recommended guidelines to keep you, your loved ones, and all of us healthy and safe during this unprecedented time. My special thanks to those of you on the front lines working to save lives and to keep us healthy and fed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I cannot predict exactly when our campus will reopen and we can gather again as a community. Remember, we are in this together, and we will come through this together – as Spartans.</p></div>

	<div class="title">March 20, 2020 - Campus Community</div>
	<div class="content"><p><strong>To the York College Community:</strong></p>
<p>This is a very uncertain time for our nation and for York College. I hope that all of you are adjusting as well as can be expected. The challenges are real, and sacrifices are required. As we hear on a daily basis, we all must do our part to "flatten the curve" and prevent the further spread of COVID-19. Yesterday, Gov. Tom Wolf took additional steps to promote social distancing across the Commonwealth by issuing a state-<span class="text_exposed_show">wide shutdown of all businesses that are "non-life-sustaining" by 8 p.m. last evening. He further indicated that state police and other government agencies will enforce his order beginning March 21 at 12:01 a.m.</span></p>
<div class="text_exposed_show">
<p>We here at York College have already been promoting social distancing within our campus community and will comply with Gov. Wolf’s decree. Beginning March 16, most students were asked to leave campus housing, and we initiated remote instruction by our faculty. As of March 23, nearly all of our students will be with their families. Only a handful of staff and administrators, those providing essential services, will continue to work from their campus locations.</p>
<p>One thing seems to be constant at this time – the impact of this COVID-19 pandemic is causing hourly and daily changes to our world. Because of this great uncertainty and the recent order by Gov. Wolf, I have decided to extend the campus closure at least until Tuesday, April 14. We hope to resume normal campus operations on that date, including face-to-face instruction for our students. A hallmark of a York College education is the close relationships that our community members value. For this reason, I am hopeful that we can reopen in time to recapture this before the close of the semester.</p>
<p>My leadership team and I are continuing our daily assessment of the situation and discussion of what is best for our campus community members. Conditions are changing, and if it becomes apparent that we will not be able to reopen by April 14, we will notify you no later than April 3.</p>
<p>Currently, commencement ceremonies are scheduled to occur as planned on May 16. If conditions require us to postpone, be assured that a face-to-face celebration of our graduates’ accomplishments will occur as soon as feasible.</p>
<p>Thank you for all you are doing to ensure our Spartan community is safe, and that we are fulfilling our mission as a college. Stay healthy, and take care of yourselves, your loved ones, and those around you.</p>

	<div class="content"><p><strong>To the York College Community:</strong></p>
<p>I am sure that all of you are following closely the spread of COVID-19 throughout the country. The&nbsp;<a href="https://www.health.pa.gov/topics/disease/Pages/Coronavirus.aspx" target="_blank">Pennsylvania Department of Health</a>&nbsp;announced today that there are two confirmed cases of COVID-19 in York County. Neither case is associated with York College.&nbsp;</p>
<p>My leadership team and I are meeting daily to discuss the latest COVID-19 developments and the impact on our community. As you will recall, we closed the York College campus to visitors earlier this week. Campus Safety has taken precautions to ensure the safety of personnel and personal property. Faculty have embraced the remote delivery of courses. There are always a few glitches, but for the most part, these efforts are successful. Our campus activities group is working to provide opportunities for students to gather “virtually” so that they can remain connected to the Spartan community.</p>
<p>To adhere to Gov. Wolf's March 16 order that all nonessential businesses close, we reduced the number of employees working on-site and allowed only those with essential duties to report to campus beginning today, March 18. Many of our students who initially stayed on campus for a variety of reasons after the closure have departed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please be assured that I am carefully weighing options for the remainder of this academic year, as I try to balance the desire to provide students with the quality educational experience they deserve and keep them and our other community members safe.&nbsp; More information will be forthcoming soon. Thank you for your patience and your cooperation.</p></div>

	<div class="title">March 14, 2020 - Campus Community and Families</div>
	<div class="content"><p>I want to provide you with an update on the status of the College’s response to COVID-19. In addition, there is a lot of misinformation that I hope to clarify.&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>To our knowledge, there is no confirmed case of COVID-19 in our campus community</strong>. As you know, there is no provision for widespread testing, especially for those not exhibiting symptoms. Several student groups traveled abroad during bring winter break. Those who were in College-sponsored programs were monitored and advised by Health Services as recommended by the CDC. Only those in areas identified by the CDC as Zone 2 or Zone 3 -- which at that time included Italy -- were asked to voluntarily self-quarantine. This precaution was not taken for students who traveled in other areas, as that was not the CDC recommendation. My decision to discontinue face-to-face classes was precautionary and intended to promote social distancing. Faculty will be in touch with students regarding classes, assignments, and other academic matters during closure.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Students living in college-owned housing have been asked to leave by noon on Sunday, March 15.&nbsp;</strong>Exceptions to this include students whose academic programs require clinicals, co-ops, or student teaching; those needing additional time to leave campus; or international students who cannot travel home. Approval for these students required the following: filing a petition with Residence Life through an online form, review by the appropriate senior administrator, and final review by the Director of Residence Life. It is important for you to know that the parameters for petition approval were evaluated and approved by me. In no case is any student required to stay on campus or to continue off-campus work or class assignments. That is voluntary. The College is accommodating those students whose ability to complete their course of study in a timely manner would be severely affected by this disruption. It is not required. Meals will be provided to students remaining in campus housing facilities that require meal plans. Campus shuttles will continue to provide transportation for clinical sites. Campus Safety will patrol campus 24/7. Access to campus and college-owned facilities will be limited to employees and students approved to remain during closure. Additional details specific to students remaining during closure has been provided to them.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>At this time, all College employees are expected to report to their work assignments during normal working hours.&nbsp;</strong>Administrative buildings will be open only to employees. Academic buildings will also be open to faculty. However, the campus will be closed to visitors and students other than those granted permission to stay. Please contact the appropriate office via phone or email should you need to conduct normal business.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>During closure, staff will be cleaning facilities according to recommended guidelines.&nbsp;</strong>We do not anticipate cleaning individual campus-owned apartments or rooms at this time. Although students will not be in residence, their belongings will remain in place.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>At this time, no decision has been made regarding refunding costs associated with room and board&nbsp;</strong><strong>during closure</strong>. We understand the financial sacrifices our families make to provide a York College education for their students.&nbsp;</li>
</ol>
<p>I want to take this opportunity to thank the York College community, including faculty, staff, and administrators, for their exceptional work during this difficult time. All of us are committed to continuing to provide a high-quality and safe experience for our students.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am asking for your patience and assistance as we move forward with our closure plan. Please understand that the situation is one that is constantly changing. Be vigilant about your health and follow CDC recommendations. Emphasize to healthy young adults who are not at home and under your direct supervision that while they are not particularly vulnerable to the virus, they can carry it to those who are. Social distancing and appropriate hygiene are important. Finally, be kind to one another. We are in this together, and we will get through this together. I will send updates regularly.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sincerely,&nbsp;</p>

	<div class="content"><p>To our York College Alumni Family:</p>
<p>In this time of uncertainty and caution over the current COVID-19 outbreak, concern over the welfare of friends and family is at the forefront of our thoughts. As you are valued members of our York College family, we wanted to take the opportunity to share important news about your alma mater and our response.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The current COVID-19 outbreak is unprecedented. The course of the virus and its related infection are yet to be fully understood. What we do know is that the virus has had, and will continue to have, major effects upon public health, and in addition, response to it is likely to strain existing resources. My first priority is always the health and safety of the York College family. Out of growing concern for the welfare of our campus community members and their families, we are suspending all face-to-face classes, effective as of 4:15 p.m., Friday, March 13, 2020. York College will close its physical campus from Sunday, March 15 (at noon) until Monday, March 30. On Monday, March 16, classes will continue remotely through Friday, March 27.</p>
<p>At this time, campus offices are scheduled to remain open during the closure. Our goal is to discourage the spread of this illness; therefore, only employees of the College and those with essential business to conduct with the College will be permitted on campus. All York College-sponsored events, both on and off campus, will be canceled throughout this period of time. If you have previously registered for a particular event, you will be notified via separate communication from our Advancement Division. YCP’s Development Office has taken steps to restructure and postpone several internal and external activities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The following events have been canceled or postponed:</p>
<ul>
<li>York Junior College Reunion – Wednesday, April 1, 2020 (postponed)</li>
<li>Harrisburg Spartan Social – Thursday, April 2, 2020 (postponed)</li>
<li>Annual Alumni Easter Egg Hunt – Sunday, April 5, 2020 (canceled)</li>
<li>Spartan Half Marathon – Sunday, April 26, 2020 (canceled)</li>
</ul>
<p>We hope to reschedule the postponed events for the 2020-21 academic year and will communicate new dates as soon as they are determined. We also will continue to assess the situation on our campus to make decisions and take actions to keep our community safe. Any updates and new information will be posted on the YCP website. You can access the information about the College’s ongoing response to the outbreak on this page, and view the status of our alumni events <a href="/about-us/offices-and-departments/alumni-relations/events/">here</a>. If you have specific questions about these events, please contact the Office of Alumni Relations at&nbsp;<a href="tel:7178156642">717.815.6642</a> or <a href="mailto:alumni@ycp.edu">alumni@ycp.edu</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for your concern and patience as we all work diligently to navigate through what is uncharted territory. Please know that York College is committed to the welfare of our community and to the success of our students. We intend to follow recommendations provided by the CDC to maintain our physical, mental, and emotional health. We are facing this together, and I am grateful to be part of a community that has already responded to the outbreak in a serious and thoughtful manner and will continue to do so.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Campus Closure</strong></p>
<p>York College will close its physical campus from Sunday, March 15 (at noon), until Monday, March 30. <strong>Students</strong> will be asked to depart from residence halls by noon on March 15. Schmidt Library, the Grumbacher Center, the Bookstore (except C-store), Johnson Dining Hall, and other common areas will be closed. Our goal is to discourage the spread of this illness; therefore, only employees of the College and those with essential business to conduct with the College will be permitted on campus.&nbsp;</p>
<p>All York College-sponsored events, both on and off campus, will be canceled throughout this period of time.</p>
<p><strong>Class Delivery</strong></p>
<p>On Monday, March 16, classes will continue remotely through Friday, March 27. Faculty members will contact students directly regarding their plans for classes. Library and Technology Services will continue to provide online assistance throughout this period of remote learning.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Clinicals, co-ops, and internships will be managed by the dean of each respective school. (Additional information for students who may be permitted to remain on campus to complete clinicals will be forthcoming)</p>
<p><strong>Residence Halls and Off-campus Housing</strong></p>
<p>Residence halls will close at noon, Sunday, March 15. All students are to vacate campus at that time unless they have received prior approval. Students who are seeking an exemption should immediately submit their request through an <a href="https://ycp.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_6l3yLN5nEESWRcp" target="_blank">online form</a>. Residence Life representatives will review submissions and contact students to provide details to those whose requests have been approved.</p>
<p>It is important to note that services will be very limited during this temporary closure. Our campus will be closed to students who have not been granted permission to stay.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Employees</strong></p>
<p><em>Staff and administrators</em> should report as usual on Monday, March 16, and work according to their typical schedules, unless other arrangements have been made with their supervisors.&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Faculty</em> may choose to teach remotely from their offices or an off-campus location.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Returning to Campus&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>The situation with respect to COVID-19 is very fluid and unpredictable. Our initial suspension of face-to-face instruction is scheduled to end on Monday, March 30. If face-to-face instruction recommences at that time, residence halls will reopen at noon on Sunday, March 29.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Should events dictate a longer period of time, you will be notified. Additional details will be posted on this page.</p>
<p>We are all working diligently to navigate through what is uncharted territory. Please know that York College is committed to the health and welfare of our community and to the success of our students. It is important to follow recommendations provided by the CDC to stay healthy both <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/about/prevention.html" target="_blank">physically</a> and <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/about/coping.html" target="_blank">emotionally</a>.

	<div class="title">March 11, 2020 - Campus Community</div>
	<div class="content"><p><strong>To the York College Community:</strong></p>
<p>It is understandable that there is growing concern regarding the possible spread of COVID-19 to our area and our campus. To date, we do not have any evidence that this is the case, and we continue to monitor and evaluate our situation. We are following all recommendations from the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/colleges-universities/index.html" target="_blank">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a>&nbsp;(CDC) and the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.health.pa.gov/topics/disease/Pages/Coronavirus.aspx" target="_blank">Pennsylvania Department of Health</a>. In addition, we have taken extra precautions, including delaying large gatherings on campus, postponing international travel, and recently, consolidating our dining services to Main Campus.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We had a number of students who traveled abroad during winter break. Several were in Italy, which as you know, is a high-infection area. Those students returned a week ago to their homes, where they have self- quarantined. They are not on campus. One faculty member who traveled to Italy has self-quarantined as well.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To our knowledge, no other community members have traveled abroad to highly infectious sites over break. Other faculty, administrators, and students who traveled on College-sponsored trips abroad were in areas designated as low-risk by the CDC (<a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2020/02/29/810440382/map-which-countries-have-cdc-travel-advisories-because-of-coronavirus" target="_blank">Level 1</a>). They are being monitored by Health Services. CDC guidelines do not recommend that they self-quarantine.&nbsp;<strong>At this time, we have no confirmed cases among our campus community members.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>This is a very uncertain and anxious time for all of us. Every college must monitor its environment and make timely, appropriate decisions for its campus community. As I indicated in other communications, York College has been preparing for its response to COVID-19. At this time, our assessment does not indicate that we should close campus; however, this could change.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our faculty are prepared to offer courses using various technologies should face-to-face classes be moved online. It is uncertain when this might happen and the length of time it would be necessary to teach in this fashion. Should we move to online learning, it is vitally important that students communicate with their instructors. Faculty will assist you to ensure you complete the course and earn the credits for which you are enrolled.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is much you can do to help us. First, let Health Services (<a href="mailto:healthcenter@ycp.edu">healthcenter@ycp.edu</a>) know if you have traveled to a high-risk area or have been in contact with someone diagnosed with the virus. Second, if you exhibit&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/about/share-facts.html" target="_blank">symptoms</a>, stay home and contact Health Services for guidance. Also, contact your instructors. Not every respiratory infection or illness is COVID-19. Third, practice&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/about/prevention.html" target="_blank">recommended hygiene</a>. Fourth, as you contemplate travel outside of campus, strongly consider avoiding&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-in-us.html#reporting-cases" target="_blank">areas of the country</a>&nbsp;where the CDC is reporting the spread of COVID-19.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Your safety is my highest priority. I will keep you informed. Together we will get through this.&nbsp;</p></div>

	<div class="content"><p><strong>To the York College community from President Gunter-Smith:</strong></p>
<p>There is growing concern on many college campuses about COVID-19 (novel coronavirus), especially regarding students traveling abroad. In response, I have convened a campus-wide task force to monitor the situation and to coordinate our planning and response related to COVID-19.&nbsp;The College is following the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html" target="_blank">Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)</a>&nbsp;guidelines. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Student Travel Abroad</p>
<p>With respect to students traveling abroad, all who have been affected by travel restrictions or recommendations will receive help to ensure their academic progress is not affected.</p>
<p>Students who had planned to study in countries identified by the CDC as Level 3 or Level 2 – widespread or sustained community transmission – will remain on campus throughout the spring semester.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Students currently studying abroad have been asked to return home.&nbsp;Those who have been residing in areas identified by the CDC as higher risk are being asked to self-quarantine for 14 days before returning to campus.&nbsp;Those who have been residing in areas not currently assessed as higher risk by CDC will be monitored by our Health Center personnel.</p>
<p>At this time, there is no recommendation to test individuals who are asymptomatic. This is a very dynamic situation, and we will continue to monitor the situation and guidelines.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Student Academic Progress</p>
<p>We are committed to continuing to ensure that students are able to earn credit hours for classes in which they are enrolled.&nbsp;Should there be a need to suspend face-to-face teaching for a period of time, or should faculty or students be advised to self-quarantine, courses will be delivered electronically.</p>
<p>I will keep you informed of the College’s response as guidelines and recommendations warrant.</p>

	<div class="content"><p><em>I am sure that many of you are aware of the recent outbreak of respiratory illness caused by a novel (new) coronavirus first identified in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China. We at York College are staying in touch with local, state and national sources to monitor the situation.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>Please see the information below -- provided by the American College Health Association -- regarding symptoms, transmission and prevention of respiratory viruses. If you have any questions, please contact the YCP Health Center at 717.849.1615.</em></p>
<p><em>Amy Downs</em><em><br></em><em>Director of Health Service</em></p>
<h3><strong>What is novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV)?</strong></h3>
<p>2019-nCoV is a newly identified coronavirus that is causing an outbreak of pneumonia illness. It was first identified in December 2019 in the city of Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.</p>
<p>Since then, the virus has been identified in multiple other countries, including cases in the U.S.</p>
<p>According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC),&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/index.html" target="_blank">human coronaviruses</a>&nbsp;are common throughout the world and usually cause mild to moderate illness in people. This new virus is a public health concern because:</p>
<ul>
<li>It is newly identified, so much is still unknown about it.</li>
<li>Two other human coronaviruses, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, have caused severe illness.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>What is the risk?</strong></h3>
<p>The CDC considers this new virus a public health concern based on current information. However, the immediate health risk to the general U.S. public is considered low at this time. The CDC and the World Health Organization are closely monitoring the situation and providing ongoing guidance.&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>Symptoms and transmission:</strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/about/symptoms.html" target="_blank">Symptoms</a>&nbsp;may be flu-like, ranging from mild to serious, and include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fever</li>
<li>Cough</li>
<li>Congestion</li>
<li>Sore throat</li>
<li>Headache</li>
<li>Difficulty breathing</li>
</ul>
<p>Person-to-person spread is occurring, although it’s unclear exactly how it is transmitted and how easily the virus spreads between people.</p>
<h3><strong>Prevention:</strong></h3>
<p>Here are everyday actions to help prevent the spread of respiratory viruses:</p>
<ul>
<li>Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. If soap and water are not available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer.</li>
<li>Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands.</li>
<li>Avoid close contact with people who are sick.</li>
<li>Stay home when you are sick.</li>
<li>Cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue, then throw the tissue in the trash.</li>
<li>Clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces, such as countertops, light switches, cell phones, remotes, and other items that are touched frequently.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Additional information:</strong></h3>
