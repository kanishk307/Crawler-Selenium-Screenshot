          Is Western planning to do layoffs or furloughs of faculty and staff?
        </button>
      </H3>

      <div class="content">
        <p>Protecting the well-being and employment security of Western’s faculty and staff in this ongoing situation is a top priority. There is no doubt that the impacts of the coronavirus and our response to it has and will continue to have significant financial implications. In planning for these scenarios, we’ve identified a mix of one-time and ongoing mitigation strategies that can be applied at the institutional level to lessen the impact on our operations. Even after applying those strategies, however, divisions will still need to plan for the likelihood of budget reductions in October. More detail on each of these items is available in the Scenarios document posted to the Budget and Financial Planning website. As we enter FY21 on July 1 we will be continuing the purchasing, travel and hiring restrictions announced in April, and urge each budget decision-maker to forward only those requests that are critical.</p>

<p>We remain hopeful that future federal stimulus action will support state budget shortfalls which could also provide further support to our state’s higher education institutions.</p>

          When is the University planning to have staff return to work on campus? What if I have underlying health conditions or other extenuating circumstances that make it difficult for me to return to work on campus?
        </button>
      </H3>

      <div class="content">
        <p>All supervisors are strongly encouraged to allow employees who may have concerns to continue to work remotely as long as it does not hamper critical operations.</p>

<p>We are closely monitoring infection and hospitalization rates in Whatcom County and other areas in the state where the University has operations, and we of course are following the Governor’s guidance on when, and under what circumstances, it is appropriate to safely return to normal operations. Currently, public gatherings continue to be banned. For those who may need to get back to work on campus before campus reopens, you may do so with prior approval from your vice president or dean.</p>

<p>Because most students and many faculty and employees on nine-month contracts are not present during the summer months, we expect that some units will be able to practice safe social distancing. In the event that University facilities reopen for normal operations, further guidance on safety protocols will be issued.</p>

          How do I respond to requests to share resources with an outside organization?
        </button>
      </H3>

      <div class="content">
        <p>Many requests for assistance in serving and supporting our local communities and the state in this crisis are flowing into offices and departments. The ICS team has developed some preliminary procedures for resource sharing with external entities, which I am happy to share with you. The goal is to create an efficient and streamlined process for responding to requests through the Incident Command structure.</p>

<p>The basic premises which will guide our resource sharing are:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Western Washington University will collaborate with local agencies and organizations where possible to support critical services and functions in the community.</li>
	<li>WWU must abide by all applicable laws, code, and policy when collaborating with local agencies and organizations.</li>
	<li>WWU must prioritize critical needs within our own organization to ensure life safety and continuity of operations.</li>
	<li>Requests for resource sharing, including transfer of WWU-owned material, temporary assignment of WWU employees, or temporary use of WWU equipment or facilities will be considered through the Whatcom Unified Command. Unified Command will have the highest priority.</li>
</ul>

<p>Western employees receiving inquiries or requests from outside entities should direct those requests to COVID19Planning@wwu.edu. WWU departments which have materials that could be considered for transfer to Whatcom Unified Command should email the type, quantity, and manufacturer of the materials to Purchasing.department@wwu.edu.</p>

          Will annual performance evaluations be required for 2019-20?

      <div class="content">
        <p>Compliance with the professional staff handbook regarding performance evaluations for 2019-2020&nbsp;was&nbsp;cancelled.&nbsp;&nbsp;Although performance evaluations are an important aspect of human resource management, under the circumstances, enforcing this could place an additional burden on supervisors and employees.  Human Resources&nbsp;encourages&nbsp;all supervisors&nbsp;to provide&nbsp;continual feedback and communication to employees regarding their performance.  HR Consultants are available to provide support.</p>

<p>Similarly,&nbsp;PSE, WFSE&nbsp;and&nbsp;the University&nbsp;have agreed that written annual performance evaluations referenced in Article 34&nbsp;and Article 6, respectively,&nbsp;of the collective bargaining agreements&nbsp;will be suspended for the 19-20 fiscal year.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

          Will salary increases go forward in 2020-21?
        </button>
      </H3>

      <div class="content">
        <p>The university has secured an agreement with the United Faculty of Western Washington (UFWW) that allows all existing contract provisions to remain in place for one year, with the understanding that we will restart salary negotiations in October after we have a better picture of state budget support and net tuition revenue. Full contract negotiations will restart in spring 2021.</p>

<p>Similar to the approach agreed upon with the UFWW, the compensation levels for professional staff will remain at current levels into the new fiscal year beginning on July 1. Our approach in the past two years has been to keep salary increases for professional staff closely aligned with salary increases for faculty. Once we have a better picture of the budget in October, we will use the salary guidelines developed with the Professional Staff Organization (PSO) to determine compensation increases for professional staff.</p>

<p>For Washington Federation of State Employees (WFSE) and Public School Employees of Washington (PSE), general wage increases are established through the collective bargaining process and approved through the Legislature. The University is obligated under state law to comply with the scheduled general wage increase for classified staff on July 1, 2020. Should the Governor enact any changes that impact state salary schedules, the University will align with the state accordingly.</p>

        <p>Employees are required to keep work files separate from personal files if using a personal device. Using Office 365 and&nbsp;<a href="https://atus.wwu.edu/kb/file-storage-file-sharing-and-backups">OneDrive</a>&nbsp;allows for remote work options with the use of personal computer equipment. In addition to OneDrive, remote work options for use of personal computer equipment would include the use of flash drives to separate files and the use of the&nbsp;<a href="https://atus.wwu.edu/kb/vpn-virtual-private-network">Virtual Private Network</a>(VPN).

          How can I get virtual private network (VPN) access?
        </button>
      </H3>

      <div class="content">
        <p>All faculty and staff now have VPN access. You do not need to request VPN through ATUS or through an Esign form unless you require access to specific services (see the Actions Required section).</p>

<p>Some university technology services require off-campus users to connect through our VPN (Virtual Private Network) service&nbsp;although many do not require VPN (see links below). In order to accommodate an increase in the demand for our VPN service, we have enabled a second VPN server&nbsp;for employees, including student employees.</p>

<h4>ACTIONS REQUIRED:</h4>

<ul>
	<li>Please review our list of services that require VPN to determine whether or not you need to connect to VPN from off-campus.&nbsp;<br />
	<a href="https://nam03.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fatus.wwu.edu%2Fkb%2Fdo-you-need-vpn&amp;data=02%7C01%7Cbryantc5%40wwu.edu%7Cc73c8e10f83e40c4e0cf08d7c9fe69b2%7Cdc46140ce26f43efb0ae00f257f478ff%7C0%7C0%7C637199966834350108&amp;sdata=iUGhdNHULjXR%2F5GFJl%2F%2F4DaC5YwJuwpf2qIZYJA8Ots%3D&amp;reserved=0">Do you need VPN?</a></li>
	<li>If you have already been granted VPN access, we ask that you review this page as well so you can limit your VPN usage to times when you need it to connect to a service.</li>
	<li><strong>Employees do not need to request access to VPN unless they need to access services listed under the "Admin VPN" section.</strong> As an employee you already have access to Standard VPN.</li>
	<li>Since VPN is a shared and limited resource; please disconnect from it when you don’t need it.</li>
</ul>

<h4>ADDITIONAL INFORMATION:</h4>

<p>Many services used by our faculty, staff, and students do not require VPN. Most students do not need VPN, and the few who do already have access to it.</p>

          Do I have to deplete all of my accrued leave before I qualify for shared leave? 
        </button>
      </H3>

      <div class="content">
        <p>No, effective March 17, 2020, you can maintain a balance of 40 hours of sick leave and 40 hours of vacation.&nbsp;You may qualify for shared leave if you or your relative or household member is isolated or quarantined as recommended, requested, or ordered by a public health office or health care provider as a result of suspected or confirmed COVID-19 infection or exposure during a declared state of emergency.</p>

<p>On March 17, 2020, the governor signed into law several meaningful changes to the Shared Leave program. Highlights include:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Employees who qualify for shared leave may maintain up to 40 hours of applicable leave in reserves.</li>
	<li>Employees may use their leave intermittently.</li>
	<li>An employee does not need to be found ineligible for industrial insurance wage benefits to be eligible for shared leave.</li>
	<li>An employee who is also receiving industrial wage replacement benefits may receive shared leave up to 25% of their base salary.</li>
	<li>Shared leave received for the purpose of parental leave must be used in the 16 weeks immediately following birth or placement, or after pregnancy disability has resolved, as long as it is used within one year after the birth of the baby.</li>
	<li>Employees may qualify for shared leave if the employee, relative, or household member is isolated or quarantined as recommended, requested, or ordered by a public health official or health care provider as a result of suspected or confirmed COVID-19 infection or exposure during the declared state of emergency.</li>

      <div class="content">
        <p>For volunteer requests from organizations other than Whatcom Unified Command, employees need to request leave from their supervisor. Staff (check your handbook/contract) have the following leave types available for such purpose:</p>

<ul type="disc">
	<li>Community Service Day</li>
	<li>Personal Holiday</li>
	<li>Personal Leave Day (available only to Classified staff)</li>
	<li>Vacation Leave</li>
	<li>Life Giving Procedure Leave (can be used for blood donation)</li>
</ul>

<p>Requests from Whatcom Unified Command will be centralized through Western’s Incident Command Structure (ICS). The ICS leadership team will evaluate each request and has the authority to transfer an employee’s work assignment to Whatcom Unified Command or other centralized command structure for a specified period of time.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Washington State ethics laws (<a href="https://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=42.52.160">RCW 42.52.160 – Use of persons, money, or property for private gain</a>) does not allow for the gifting of university time to outside organizations, even during this time of health crisis.

Exceptions to the hiring suspension may be considered by your divisional vice president or dean for situations that meet immediate and critical functions:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Direct impact to safety and well-being</li>
	<li>Immediate need to deliver instruction and research</li>
	<li>Compliance with federal, state, and local laws and regulations</li>
	<li>Maintain basic operational infrastructure</li>
</ul>

<p>Contracting for new non-tenure-track hires, NTT rehires, and returning NTT faculty is not affected by the hiring suspension and will proceed according to the general guidance provided by the Provost’s Office following the usual approval procedures.</p>

        <p>To help minimize the spread of disease, Western is asking that supervisors screen employees who report to work on university property as recommended by the <a href="https://www.doh.wa.gov/Portals/1/Documents/1600/coronavirus/Employervisitorscreeningguidance.pdf">WA State Department of Health</a>. This guidance should also be used for visitors. Supervisors and department heads should follow this recommendation for the duration of Gov.

<p>A supervisor should screen for the four symptoms stated in the guidance document. If an employee affirms they have any of the four symptoms related to COVID-19, supervisors should advise employees to contact their medical provider and begin isolation procedures as noted in the <a href="https://www.wwu.edu/files/2020-03/Supervisor-mgr%20assessment%20guide%2020200318%20final.pdf">Supervisor-mgt assessment guide</a>.</p>

<p>We understand supervisors and students are facing difficult decisions and we want you to know that the Student Employment Office is here to support you in any way. Each department’s needs are different and a ‘one size fits all’ approach won’t work. We’d like to help make it easier to evaluate your unique circumstances by providing some flexible ways to approach this.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Approach 1</strong><strong>:</strong>&nbsp;If all or some of your student employee(s)’s job duties can be performed remotely, consider asking them to perform their job from home and supplement remaining hours with professional development. Support for supervisors and employees on working remotely can be found&nbsp;<a href="https://www.wwu.edu/spring-guide/employees">here</a>. Professional development options unique to student employees can be found&nbsp;<a href="https://nam03.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/ap/w-59584e83/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwwu2.sharepoint.com%2F%3Aw%3A%2Fs%2FOrganizationalandTalentDevelopment%2FEVgZdnRLGntKlljKwGJbZ4kBDixAYw69Cdpc1Og-FaneuQ%3Fe%3Dr0gifk&amp;data=02%7C01%7Cfraleyz%40wwu.edu%7C66b204abadaf473be58b08d7d750210e%7Cdc46140ce26f43efb0ae00f257f478ff%7C0%7C0%7C637214611453222576&amp;sdata=73WgAM8nB9BGdf2cC6ZmPg9ZJY%2FjXLBKHZ4fztwcP7E%3D&amp;reserved=0">here</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Approach 2</strong><strong>:</strong>&nbsp;If none of your student employee(s)’s job duties can be performed remotely and they are NOT a critical employee performing essential functions, consider some of these approaches to support them in the best way possible:&nbsp;</p>

<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Change the position/work so that some or all of the job duties can be performed remotely.&nbsp;</p>

<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ask other departments if they have work the student employee could perform.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Allow the student employee to participate in professional development for a set period of time prior to their position ending to provide them with advanced notice to make other arrangements.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Communicate to the student employee that you are hopeful that you can re-hire them once conditions allow but that unfortunately, you cannot continue their employment at this time.&nbsp;</p>

<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Provide support utilizing some of the below resources:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

</ul>

<p><strong>Approach 3</strong><strong>:</strong>&nbsp;If none of your student employee(s)’s job duties can be performed remotely but they ARE a critical employee performing essential functions, consider asking them to perform their job on campus if they are comfortable doing so. These types of positions are rare and must be deemed critical by Incident Command. Reach out to your HR Consultant for any questions.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We understand that some approaches have fiscal impacts that may depend on state support, self-sustaining, or student-fee funds, and these impacts will be unique to each department.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Our student employees are a valuable resource and vital to Western Washington University’s success. Because of this, we continue to encourage departments to support the continuation of student employment to the extent possible.&nbsp;</p>

The <a href="https://wp.wwu.edu/hr/2020/03/06/supervisors-guide-to-remote-work/">Supervisors’ Guide to Remote Work</a> is a resource available to help guide this conversation.&nbsp; Relevant considerations include:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Can the employee perform their duties/responsibilities remotely? Does the employee have the equipment, connectivity and access required to work to perform those tasks?&nbsp; If not, is that something that can be remedied?&nbsp; For example, does the department have a laptop the employee can use for remote work?</li>
	<li>If there is a portion of the job that can be performed remotely, consider a hybrid approach where the employee works from home for a portion of time and is at the worksite for the remainder of time.</li>
	<li>If your worksite requires on-site coverage, consider:

<p>The University will follow communication instructions to employees and students received by the public health authority to ensure those with a need to know receive the information necessary to take appropriate action.</p>

<p>Those who receive specific details of an employee or student because they have a need to know are asked to refrain from using the individual’s name or other identifying information in subsequent conversations especially electronic communications (email, TEAMS, etc).

<p>Western Washington University is suspending all non-essential, out-of-state University travel effective immediately through May 31, 2020. This includes, but is not limited to, conferences and/or professional development opportunities. Undergraduate student travel for University-related purposes, including athletics, is considered non-essential.</p>

<p>Essential travel is travel deemed necessary to the operations of the University.&nbsp; All exceptions to the travel restriction require prior approval by your vice president or the Provost.</p>

<p>Travelers should work with airlines, hotels, car rental agencies, and conference sponsors to request refunds and/or credits for any travel through May 31, 2020.</p>

<p>The restrictions on official WWU travel do not apply to personal travel, though we strongly recommend reviewing travel warnings from the CDC and U.S. Department of State.&nbsp;</p>

      <div class="content">
        <p>Yes, the spread of COVID-19 is affecting our communities both at home in Washington and abroad. In relation to COVID-19, the CDC issued on its&nbsp;<a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/notices">Travel Health Notices</a>&nbsp;page an Alert Level 2 (Practice Enhanced Precautions) for the entire world and a Warning Level 3 (Avoid Non-Essential Travel) for Europe and some select countries.

<p><strong>In deference to CDC and State Department recommendations, Western has encouraged all students abroad to return home, and it has canceled all study abroad through the end of spring quarter 2020. </strong>Decisions for summer study abroad are still to be determined. As per Western's long-existing&nbsp;<a href="https://policy.wwu.edu/POL-U2105.01-Traveling-Outside-the-United-States.pdf">policy</a>&nbsp;for studying abroad in countries with CDC and State Department Level 3 advisories, students who were already abroad were given the option to petition to stay, as a number of countries around the world currently have lower incidence of COVID-19 than Washington state.&nbsp;</p>

      <div class="content">
        <p>The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has issued guidance for persons arriving in the United States from China:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Foreign nationals who have visited China in the past 14 days may not enter the United States.</li>
	<li>American citizens, lawful permanent residents, and their families who have been in China in the past 14 days will be allowed to enter the United States, but will be redirected to one of 11 airports, including Seattle-Tacoma International Airport, to undergo health screening. Depending on their health and travel history, they will have some level of restrictions on their movements for 14 days from the time they left China.</li>
</ol>

<p>Based on this and additional guidance issued by the CDC, WWU is asking community members to follow the following instructions:</p>

<h4>Students</h4>

<p>Any student who arrived in the U.S. on or after Feb. 3, 2020 AND visited mainland China in the previous 14 days should stay at home and not attend class or other WWU-related activities until a full 14 days have passed since their last day in mainland China. Any student who meets these criteria — or is unsure whether they do — should contact the Student Health Center at 360-650-3400. This will assist in ensuring the safety and care of those in need as well as the rest of the Western community.</p>

<h4>Faculty, other academic personnel and staff</h4>

<p>All WWU faculty, other academic personnel or staff who have arrived in the U.S. on or after Feb. 3 AND visited mainland China in the previous 14 days are asked to</p>

<ul>
	<li>Stay at home and monitor their health until a full 14 days have passed since their last day in mainland China, and</li>
	<li>Contact the Student Health Center for further information, support and coordination.</li>

<h4>Individuals To Inform a University Administrator of a Known or Suspected Communicable Disease</h4>

<p>Persons who know or who have reason to believe that they are infected with a communicable disease have an ethical and legal obligation to conduct themselves in ways that minimize exposure in order to protect themselves and others.</p>

<p>Students and employees who know, or have reason to believe, that they have a communicable disease will inform the appropriate university administrator.&nbsp; Students should contact the&nbsp;<a href="tel:+13606503400">Student Health Center</a>&nbsp;or the Office of the Vice President for Enrollment and Student Services.&nbsp; Administrators, faculty or staff members who become aware of a potential or known condition involving a student should contact the&nbsp;<a href="tel:+13606503400">Associate Medical Director</a>. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Employees unable to attend work due to a known or suspected communicable disease should contact both their health care provider and report their absence to their supervisor.&nbsp; Employees are encouraged to also contact Human Resources for guidance regarding disclosure of a communicable disease and for assistance working with their department with any necessary leave or restrictions. Human Resources will notify the Medical Director of any suspected or known communicable diseases.</p>

<h4>Individuals Arriving from a Travel Health Warning Area or a Pandemic Influenza Affected Area Must Contact the Associate Medical Director</h4>

<p>Individuals traveling for official university business will comply with the Centers for Disease Control (CDC)Travel Health Warnings that have been issued on their website: <a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/notices">https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/notices</a> for each country outside the U.S. they plan to visit.</p>

<p>It is the responsibility of the employee to review&nbsp;<a href="https://policy.wwu.edu/POL-U2105.01-Traveling-Outside-the-United-States.pdf">POL-U2105.01(Traveling Outside the United States)</a> prior to travel. Any employee, student, prospective student, volunteer or visitor who knowingly arrives from a Travel Health Warning area or a Pandemic Influenza Affected Area must contact the Associate Medical Director for medical clearance before being allowed on campus to attend classes, work or other activities.</p>

          I have a paper to present at a conference that at this time is still scheduled to meet but the dates of which are before October 16. Can I still make travel plans?
        </button>
      </H3>

      <div class="content">
        <p>Currently travel will not be approved because of concerns for traveler safety. If travel guidance allows for travel (meaning that health and safety restrictions have been lifted), and the conference runs in person as scheduled, then development travel can be approved. Professional development/travel funding is stipulated in the WWU/UFWW Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA), so applying financial mitigation measures to that funding would not realize savings given current agreements and commitments. Also, it is incumbent upon us to try to avoid any differential impact on faculty development (faculty whose conferences are in the summer as opposed to the winter, for example).</p>

          I have a paper to present at a conference that has gone virtual. Given both the travel ban and the spending freeze, can I register and be reimbursed?

      <div class="content">
        <p>Yes. As in the above case, funding for this purpose is stipulated in the CBA, so freezing this spending would not realize savings.</p>
