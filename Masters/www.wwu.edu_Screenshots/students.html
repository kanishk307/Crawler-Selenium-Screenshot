          Undergraduate Grading Policy Changes
        </button>
      </H3>

      <div class="content">
        <h3>Pass/No Pass (EP/NP) Grading</h3>

<p>The coronavirus pandemic has led the university to shift to remote learning, a modality that is new for many faculty and students. In response to this shift, and the likelihood of disruptions as the pandemic continues, the University has moved to a Pass/No (EP/NP) grading policy. A grade of EP (Pass – Exceptional Circumstance) during spring and summer 2020 will count towards curricular, major, continuation, and degree requirements for all students.</p>

<p>Your class performance may be recorded in Canvas or provided to you in another format by your instructor. Students who get an A — D+, upon course completion, will receive a EP (pass). If D — F, a NP (no pass). <strong>If a student requests their letter grade by June 5 (Spring) or July 24 (Summer), it will be entered in place of the P/NP grade.&nbsp;</strong>An assigned grade of K (incomplete) will be removed and replaced by the earned grade upon completion of remaining assignments. &nbsp;This will only apply for Spring 2020 and Summer 2020 quarters.</p>

<p>Some departments may raise the minimum passing grade. If this is the case, you will be notified before classes start.</p>

<h3>Student Requests for Letter Grades</h3>

<p>Students have the option of requesting that letter grades be added to their transcript, rather than the EP/NP grade - and have until June 5, 2020, Friday of Finals Preparation Week, to do so for Spring Quarter, and July 24 for Summer. Instructions for making this request will be provided by your instructor.</p>

<h3>Pass Standards and D Grades</h3>

<p>All grades of D+ and above will receive an EP unless a student requests their letter grade or if the department has approved a different standard. A grade below the pass standard (typically, F, D or D-) will be recorded as a NP, which will not earn credits or be reflected in the GPA. A student may elect to have the letter grade of D or D- reported to their transcript, which will earn credits and be reflected in the GPA. A grade of F will be recorded as NP on the transcript, will not receive degree credit, and will not be reflected in the GPA.</p>

<h3>Special Situations</h3>

<p>Some students may be advised to request a letter grade if grades are required by an external accreditor or other purpose relevant to their program. Your professor or Chair will inform you if letter grades are required or recommended by your program.</p>

<p>Some degree programs require a grade higher than a D+ for a course to count toward a major. Students in this situation will be informed of the higher pass standard by their faculty.</p>

          Graduate Student Grading Policy Changes
        </button>
      </H3>

      <div class="content">
        <p>During all quarters in which P/NP interim grading policies are in effect at the undergraduate level, the following policy will apply to graduate level courses, beginning Summer 2020.</p>

<p><img alt="PDF icon" height="16" src="https://gradschool.wwu.edu/modules/file/icons/application-pdf.png" width="16" /> <a href="https://gradschool.wwu.edu/files/Graduate%20School%20Interim%20Grading%20Policy%20Summer%202020.pdf">Graduate School Interim Grading Policy</a></p>

<h5>Policy Highlights</h5>

<ul>
	<li>Graduate students may choose P/NP grading for courses that are normally A-F letter-graded, excluding thesis courses. Courses graded S/U cannot be changed to P/NP.</li>
	<li>Students who request P/NP must initiate the grade mode change two weeks prior to the end of the quarter, or one week prior to the end of summer quarter.</li>
	<li>A minimum C- equivalent is required to receive a P grade. Programs may specify a higher passing grade, and must communicate that to students by the first day of the course.</li>
	<li>Beginning Summer 2020, a maximum of 6 credits of P grades may be counted toward degree requirements. All spring 2020 P grades may apply to degree requirements, and do not count against the 6 maximum.</li>
</ul>

          How will fall quarter 2020 differ from spring and summer for international students?
        </button>
      </H3>

      <div class="content">
        <p>Due to COVID-19, the Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP) instituted a temporary exemption regarding online courses for the spring and summer semesters that allowed nonimmigrant students to take more online courses than normally permitted by federal regulation to maintain their nonimmigrant status during the COVID-19 emergency. SEVP just announced that those exemptions will be modified for fall 2020 so that students attending schools adopting a hybrid model — that is, a mixture of online and in-person classes such as Western plans for fall — will be allowed to take more than one class or three credit hours online but must have a portion of their instruction done in-person.&nbsp;</p>

          If I’m an international student studying in the US, can I take online classes at Western?
        </button>
      </H3>

      <div class="content">
        <p>International students who are staying in the U.S. are normally limited to one online class. For fall quarter you can take more than one class online, but you must take a hybrid or face-to-face course as part of your full course of study requirement (12 credits for undergraduates). Classes labeled “Online” or “Remote” (Synchronous or Asynchronous) are all considered online. Please email your major advisor if you have questions about appropriate classes to continue making normal progress in your degree program.</p>

        <p>International students <em>may not</em> take an entirely online/remote course load for the fall 2020 quarter and remain in the U.S. Students should take at least one face-to-face or hybrid class for fall 2020, as listed in ClassFinder. These classes can be found using the “Delivery Methods” filter on ClassFinder.</p>

        <p>Students may take all online classes from their home country. It should be noted that international students who take all classes online will not be able to stay in the U.S.</p>

<p>You may have some challenges with travel if you plan to leave the U.S., so please stay well-informed. Check the airlines, the CDC, the consulate and your own country’s travel and health advisories.</p>

<p>Students will need to contact ISSS the quarter before returning to the US to ensure their SEVIS record is still active. ISSS will work with you to take the necessary steps for your particular situation.</p>

        <p>The Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP) guidance is not yet in final published form.

Our recommendations are based on the current SEVP guidance. This is the clearest way for you to stay in status at this time. We want to give you this information in time for you to adjust your schedule before registration closes on July 17, or to decide if you want to study from your home country. We will send updates as we receive them.</p>

          Will WWU hold in-person classes during fall quarter? 
        </button>
      </H3>

      <div class="content">
        <p>While there is still much contingency planning underway, our current expectation is that fall quarter will start&nbsp;in person&nbsp;as scheduled on September 23 with a hybrid approach that allows for a mix of online and in-person classes.&nbsp; This approach&nbsp;may&nbsp;include moving large lecture&nbsp;sections&nbsp;online together with smaller in-person seminars; moving small and medium-sized classes to larger&nbsp;lecture halls to ensure safe social distancing; and&nbsp;spreading classes across days and times with staggered end times to reduce class size and ensure safe social distancing.&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>All students will have the option of taking any class online instead of in person if they choose. </strong></p>

<p>An academic planning committee is at work on&nbsp;recommendations, and we expect to issue more detailed guidance&nbsp;as soon as possible.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Our fall plans will comply with Gov.&nbsp;Jay&nbsp;Inslee’s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.governor.wa.gov/news-media/inslee-signs-new-covid-19-order-phased-re-opening-washingtons-economy">Safe Start&nbsp;Washington&nbsp;phased approach</a>&nbsp;for reopening businesses,&nbsp;and&nbsp;it&nbsp;will be informed by guidance from the&nbsp;Washington State Department of Health&nbsp;and&nbsp;the Whatcom County Health Department.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Paramount in all of our considerations is to protect the most vulnerable members of our community, and that means providing flexibility and support for those who may need to continue to work and study remotely.&nbsp; Students will have online access to all in-person classes, and all faculty members will have the option to teach fully online.&nbsp; Importantly, these contingency plans will also allow us to pivot to fully online should infection and hospitalization rates spike again in the fall.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

          What resources are available at Western for students who are struggling financially right now?
        </button>
      </H3>

      <div class="content">
        <p>In this time of uncertainty, we are working to provide those in need with resources in the local community and on campus. Several offices from across campus are partnering to provide available resources&nbsp;for&nbsp;students, including the creation of a <a href="https://wp.wwu.edu/officeofstudentlife/covid-19-student-assistance/  ">resources website</a> that includes an intake form to assess student needs.</p>

<p>After a student submits&nbsp;<a href="https://wwu.az1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_85F4Qt5BIqgx56B">the intake form</a>,&nbsp;a staff member will contact them with&nbsp;personalized&nbsp;assistance.&nbsp;Examples of assistance might be a grocery gift card, swipes for meals in a&nbsp;dining commons, assistance with emergency housing,&nbsp;and/or&nbsp;laundry cards.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>This work is a collaboration with Western’s Office of Financial Aid,&nbsp;Western Hub of Living Essentials (WHOLE) Pantry, Associated Students, Off-Campus Living, the Western Foundation, Western Success Scholars program, Dining Services, Residence Life, Office of Sustainability, the Outback Farm&nbsp;and the Office of Student Life.&nbsp;We will continue to assess emerging needs to best match with resources and hope to continue to provide students with support in this trying times.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

      </H3>

      <div class="content">
        <p>An 'asynchronous' or fully online course is delivered such that students can complete the work at any time in a day (or sometimes a week). These courses do not require that faculty or students be at their computer during the scheduled class time. In a 'synchronous' or remote class students must be online during the regularly scheduled class time. This structure is most like a face-to-face class and can involve typical lectures delivered via Zoom or another tool.</p>

      </H3>

      <div class="content">
        <p>While seating and room size are typically part of our assessment of capacity, it is still the case that capacity issues matter in the remote learning environment that we will be operating in this spring.&nbsp; Faculty and departments make decisions about the appropriate size of classes in order to provide an optimal learning experience, whether face-to-face or online.&nbsp; In some cases, remote teaching can produce a heavier assessment and grading burden on faculty, as well.&nbsp; Capacity is a function of many considerations.</p>

        <p>In light of the most recent<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/large-events/index.html"> recommendations from the CDC</a> to limit the size of all social and public gatherings, along with the Governor’s March 23<a href="https://www.governor.wa.gov/news-media/inslee-announces-stay-home-stay-healthy%C2%A0order"> “Stay Home, Stay Healthy”</a> order for the State of Washington, Western Libraries will be closed to the public until further notice.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We recognize the importance of library collections to Western’s teaching, learning, and research missions. However, at least for the duration of the Governor’s “Stay Home, Stay Safe” order, it will not be possible to loan items from the Western Libraries’ circulating collection. Likewise, the Orbis Cascade Alliance has suspended Summit borrowing until further notice.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Once it is again safe to do so, circulation of physical materials will resume, and Libraries will communicate new information as soon as it becomes available. <strong>Please also know that the due date for all materials checked out to patrons will be extended to June 15 </strong>(except for items already due after that date).&nbsp; Recalls will not be possible during this period.</p>

<p>While the Libraries’ physical buildings and collections are not accessible at this time, the Libraries is committed to providing as much online access to collections, services, and support as possible. Please see the web pages:<a href="https://library.wwu.edu/about/coronavirus/services-access-faq#/"> Library Services and Access to Materials FAQs</a> and the<a href="https://library.wwu.edu/about/coronavirus/teaching-learning-faq"> Teaching and Learning FAQs</a> for more information.&nbsp;</p>

If you have a specific question, please contact <a href="mailto:Library.Collections@wwu.edu">Library.Collections@wwu.edu</a>.</p>

<p>We want to stay connected to each other during these difficult times, and we encourage you to reach out to us and share any questions, concerns, and comments you may have, (or even if you just want to say hello!).&nbsp; Please remember we are still here with you, even if we are not all in the same building.

          Are there limitations for student experiential learning programs (e.g. internships)?
        </button>
      </H3>

      <div class="content">
        <p>Generally, if a host site is still accepting our students, then internships, student teaching and other experiential learning that is currently in place may continue as planned.</p>

<p>Faculty or staff advisors commonly evaluate the acceptability of a host site for meeting the objectives of their department’s experiential learning program and a formal relationship with that host site is established. As a precaution, and if practical, advisors may wish to ask their host site liaison what they are doing to protect their employees, clients and interns from transmitting and contracting COVID-19. That information should be passed along to our students.</p>

<p>Students who are responsible for evaluating and selecting their own host site for their experiential learning activities may wish to ask their host site representative about COVID-19 protection measures as well. Students should be instructed to weigh the risks and benefits and then make the best choice for the own health, safety and well-being.</p>

<p>Students should be instructed to closely follow the policies and procedures of their host sites, including required prevention measures, screening for symptoms, personal protective equipment (e.g. face mask, gloves and gowns), social distancing and reporting when they feel sick or suspect they may have COVID-19 symptoms.</p>

<p>Also, a student’s professional credentialing organization may be relaxing the field experience and clinical practice requirements in light of COVID-19. For example, the Washington State Professional Educator Standards Board (PESB) has done this for student educators.</p>

<p><strong>Notwithstanding the above, host sites that are experiencing a COVID-19 outbreak should be avoided. </strong>Requests for exceptions should be directed to <a href="mailto:&quot;paul.mueller@wwu.edu&quot;">Paul Mueller</a>, Director of Risk, Compliance and Policy Services at x3065.</p>

<p>Faculty, staff or students who know or suspect they have COVID-19 should follow applicable guidance posted in the Frequently Asked Questions.</p>

          Are field courses treated differently from other classes?
        </button>

      <div class="content">
        <p>No. Field courses are subject to the same limitations as other&nbsp;<a href="https://www.wwu.edu/coronavirus/students">face-to-face classes</a>.&nbsp; Faculty will need to explore other arrangements for delivering their course materials.</p>

<p>Generally, field courses are curriculum-required courses where learning or research takes place in a natural environment with a small cohort of students under the supervision of a field course leader. Students are provided a supervised, practical experience that applies classroom knowledge, theory, and skills of their discipline in the field.</p>

          Why do I have to pay more for some online courses, labeled as Academic Year Self-Sustaining (AYSS) Courses?
        </button>
      </H3>

      <div class="content">
        <p>Academic Year Self-Sustaining courses do not receive state support and are funded completely by Western, which means they cost more in tuition.&nbsp;AYSS courses are noted as such in both Classfinder and Web4U Registration and the per credit tuition rate is posted as $265/credit.</p>

<p><br />
For students who are enrolled in fewer than ten credits, the AYSS courses offer an option with little cost difference, but students who enroll in 10-18 credits may be best served by finding similar state-supported class sections.</p>

<p>While the state does not provide funding for AYSS courses, Western is committed to serving students across Washington, and chooses to provide access to a wider depth and breadth of courses than students would otherwise have access to.&nbsp;</p>

          Are the WTA buses running normally if I need to get to campus?
        </button>
      </H3>

      <div class="content">
        <p>WTA is&nbsp;limiting the number of people that can ride on its fixed route buses to no more than 12 passengers. Up to 15 will be allowed if those riding together are couples or parents with children.</p>

<p>If it appears there are already 12 people on board, the driver will ask anyone waiting at a stop to wait for the next bus.</p>

<p>When possible, WTA is running “trailers,” or extra buses on routes that have been attracting higher ridership.&nbsp;While fixed route ridership is down nearly 80 percent, there are some routes where the number of riders is limiting people’s ability to maintain a safe distance.</p>

<p>WTA continues to urge people to ride the bus for essential trips only, such as trips to the grocery store, pharmacy, or to keep medical appointments. Riders should plan extra time in case the bus they are waiting for has reached its maximum capacity.</p>

<p>Buses on routes around the university are likely to meet the maximum capacity. In addition to making essential trips only, WTA urges students to walk or bike as much as possible, or to drive alone if that is the only alternative.</p>

<p>Fares continue to be free until further notice. All riders enter and exit the bus using the rear door, unless they need they need to use the ramp.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Until further notice WTA is providing Saturday levels of service five days a week (Monday through Friday), and a Sunday level of service on Saturdays and Sundays.</p>

<p>Western recognizes the importance of health and safety as we return to campus.&nbsp; Following the Governor’s phased approach to reopening, Western’s Incident Command team is working on general guidelines to support the gradual return of employees to campus.&nbsp; Further communication will be provided as guidance is developed.&nbsp;</p>

<p>At this time, we do not anticipate requiring a COVID-19 test for students, faculty and staff unless we are directed to do so by state health officials, however, all members of the University community are encouraged to stay home if you are not feeling well, and to&nbsp;familiarize yourself with&nbsp;common COVID-19 symptoms via this&nbsp;<a href="https://landing.google.com/screener/covid19">self-assessment</a>&nbsp;tool&nbsp;based on Centers for&nbsp;Disease&nbsp;Control and Prevention&nbsp;criteria.&nbsp;&nbsp;Further updates will be shared by email and posted on the&nbsp;<a href="https://studenthealth.wwu.edu/">Student Health Center</a>&nbsp;website as soon as possible.&nbsp;</p>

        <p>No.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Western Washington University is suspending all non-essential, out-of-state University travel effective immediately through May 31, 2020. This includes, but is not limited to, conferences and/or professional development opportunities. Undergraduate student travel for University-related purposes, including athletics, is considered non-essential.</p>

<p>Essential travel is travel deemed necessary to the operations of the University.&nbsp; All exceptions to the travel restriction require prior approval by your vice president or the Provost.</p>

<p>Travelers should work with airlines, hotels, car rental agencies, and conference sponsors to request refunds and/or credits for any travel through May 31, 2020.</p>

<p>The restrictions on official WWU travel do not apply to personal travel, though we strongly recommend reviewing travel warnings from the CDC and U.S. Department of State.&nbsp;</p>

      </H3>

      <div class="content">
        <p>Yes, the spread of COVID-19 is affecting our communities both at home in Washington and abroad. In relation to COVID-19, the CDC issued on its&nbsp;<a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/notices">Travel Health Notices</a>&nbsp;page an Alert Level 2 (Practice Enhanced Precautions) for the entire world and a Warning Level 3 (Avoid Non-Essential Travel) for Europe and some select countries. Likewise, the State Department issued a&nbsp;<a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/traveladvisories/ea/travel-advisory-alert-global-level-3-health-advisory-issue.html">Global Health Advisory Level 3</a>&nbsp;(Reconsider Travel).</p>

<p><strong>In deference to CDC and State Department recommendations, Western has encouraged all students abroad to return home, and it has canceled all study abroad through the end of spring quarter 2020. </strong>Decisions for summer study abroad are still to be determined. As per Western's long-existing&nbsp;<a href="https://policy.wwu.edu/POL-U2105.01-Traveling-Outside-the-United-States.pdf">policy</a>&nbsp;for studying abroad in countries with CDC and State Department Level 3 advisories, students who were already abroad were given the option to petition to stay, as a number of countries around the world currently have lower incidence of COVID-19 than Washington state.&nbsp;</p>

          What should I do if I am in mainland China and planning to return to the U.S., or recently traveled to the U.S. from China?
        </button>
      </H3>

      <div class="content">
        <p>The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has issued guidance for persons arriving in the United States from China:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Foreign nationals who have visited China in the past 14 days may not enter the United States.</li>
	<li>American citizens, lawful permanent residents, and their families who have been in China in the past 14 days will be allowed to enter the United States, but will be redirected to one of 11 airports, including Seattle-Tacoma International Airport, to undergo health screening. Depending on their health and travel history, they will have some level of restrictions on their movements for 14 days from the time they left China.</li>
</ol>

<p>Based on this and additional guidance issued by the CDC, WWU is asking community members to follow the following instructions:</p>

<h4>Students</h4>

<p>Any student who arrived in the U.S. on or after Feb. 3, 2020 AND visited mainland China in the previous 14 days should stay at home and not attend class or other WWU-related activities until a full 14 days have passed since their last day in mainland China. Any student who meets these criteria — or is unsure whether they do — should contact the Student Health Center at 360-650-3400. This will assist in ensuring the safety and care of those in need as well as the rest of the Western community.</p>

<h4>Faculty, other academic personnel and staff</h4>

<p>All WWU faculty, other academic personnel or staff who have arrived in the U.S. on or after Feb. 3 AND visited mainland China in the previous 14 days are asked to</p>

<ul>
	<li>Stay at home and monitor their health until a full 14 days have passed since their last day in mainland China, and</li>
	<li>Contact the Student Health Center for further information, support and coordination.</li>
</ul>

<p>Western will work with affected individuals on workplace, academic and other necessary support. Personal health information will remain confidential (or protected) in accordance with University policy.</p>

<h4>Individuals To Inform a University Administrator of a Known or Suspected Communicable Disease</h4>

<p>Persons who know or who have reason to believe that they are infected with a communicable disease have an ethical and legal obligation to conduct themselves in ways that minimize exposure in order to protect themselves and others.</p>

<p>Students and employees who know, or have reason to believe, that they have a communicable disease will inform the appropriate university administrator.&nbsp; Students should contact the&nbsp;<a href="tel:+13606503400">Student Health Center</a>&nbsp;or the Office of the Vice President for Enrollment and Student Services.&nbsp; Administrators, faculty or staff members who become aware of a potential or known condition involving a student should contact the&nbsp;<a href="tel:+13606503400">Associate Medical Director</a>. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Employees unable to attend work due to a known or suspected communicable disease should contact both their health care provider and report their absence to their supervisor.&nbsp; Employees are encouraged to also contact Human Resources for guidance regarding disclosure of a communicable disease and for assistance working with their department with any necessary leave or restrictions. Human Resources will notify the Medical Director of any suspected or known communicable diseases.</p>

<h4>Individuals Arriving from a Travel Health Warning Area or a Pandemic Influenza Affected Area Must Contact the Associate Medical Director</h4>

<p>Individuals traveling for official university business will comply with the Centers for Disease Control (CDC)Travel Health Warnings that have been issued on their website: <a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/notices">https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/notices</a> for each country outside the U.S. they plan to visit.</p>

<p>It is the responsibility of the employee to review&nbsp;<a href="https://policy.wwu.edu/POL-U2105.01-Traveling-Outside-the-United-States.pdf">POL-U2105.01(Traveling Outside the United States)</a> prior to travel. Any employee, student, prospective student, volunteer or visitor who knowingly arrives from a Travel Health Warning area or a Pandemic Influenza Affected Area must contact the Associate Medical Director for medical clearance before being allowed on campus to attend classes, work or other activities.</p>

The ban on in-state travel is based on Governor Inslee’s Stay Home – Stay Healthy order and is currently expected to stay in place through May 31.

      <div class="content">
        <p>May 31 is an anticipated date concerning in-state travel.

When the order is lifted, the in-state ban will be re-evaluated. October 16 is the current ending date of the ban on out-of-state travel.</p>

      <div class="content">
        <p>Currently the State Department and CDC travel alerts are at their highest, with both organizations urging no non-essential international travel, and various governments in the United States instituting restrictions on travel.

        </button>
      </H3>

      <div class="content">
        <p>Currently travel will not be approved because of concerns for traveler safety. If travel guidance allows for travel (meaning that health and safety restrictions have been lifted), and the conference runs in person as scheduled, then development travel can be approved. Professional development/travel funding is stipulated in the WWU/UFWW Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA), so applying financial mitigation measures to that funding would not realize savings given current agreements and commitments. Also, it is incumbent upon us to try to avoid any differential impact on faculty development (faculty whose conferences are in the summer as opposed to the winter, for example).</p>

<p class="x"><strong>Disability, equitable access, and accommodations</strong></p>

<p class="x">This course is intended for all WWU students, including those with visible or invisible disabilities. Students with disabilities will be provided equitable access to educational experiences and opportunities. If, at any point in the quarter, you find yourself not able to fully access the space, content, and experience of this course, please first contact the Disability Access Center (DAC) to discuss potential accommodations. Faculty and staff partner with the DAC in the implementation of accommodations.</p>

<p class="x">If you already have accommodations set up through the DAC, please be sure to send your Faculty Notification Letter to me, through the myDAC portal, and reach out so we can discuss how your approved accommodations apply to this course.</p>

<p class="x">If you are unsure if accommodations are appropriate for you, contact the DAC for more information, temporary assistance, or connections to other resources: <a href="https://disability.wwu.edu/">Disability.wwu.edu</a> or 360-650-3083.</p>

      <div class="content">
        <p>We recommend that, where possible, faculty relax attendance policies or otherwise create procedures for students to make up for absences or missed work, given the likelihood that students--or someone in their family--may fall ill or face other disruptions this term.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.wwu.edu/registrar/">Registrar’s calendar</a> of important dates for Spring has been revised.</p>

<p>A student who is unable to complete a course due to hardship may petition for a late course withdrawal after the stated deadline. Hardship is considered to be an incapacitating injury or illness requiring extensive recuperation or a significant personal emergency such as the death of an immediate family member.&nbsp;Instruction and more information are available from&nbsp;The&nbsp;<a href="https://wp.wwu.edu/officeofstudentlife/">Office of Student Life.</a></p>

        <p>The Western A.S. Bookstore, your independent student store since 1910, is closed to in-store purchases. Store personnel are still working hard to fulfill course material orders to support students as they shift to online courses for Spring quarter.</p>

<p>Spring 2020 course materials are available online for purchase. Spring 2020 course materials are available in eBook formats in addition to traditional books. Digital alternatives are listed alongside rental and purchase options wherever they are available.</p>

<p>40% of the titles adopted by faculty for Spring Quarter now available in eBook formats in addition to traditional books. Digital alternatives will be listed alongside rental and purchase options wherever they are available.</p>

<p>As always, purchases can be made through credit/debit cards, bookstore gift cards, or charging student accounts. Many students count on the ability to charge their purchases to their student account when they purchase through Western’s Bookstore.</p>

<p>Order fulfillment is through shipments only at this time. We will process orders as quickly as possible. Note, we have limited staffing onsite due to the shutdown and the safety of our team.</p>

<p>We realize this is a shift in how students may normally purchase textbooks. Our efforts are to ensure we are following best practices as a response for Covid-19 social distancing for both students and for our staff. Spring 2020 course materials are eligible for refund, in the same condition they were purchased, by the add/drop date of 4/12/2020. If you have questions about your adoption for Spring 2020, please email us at <a href="mailto:textdept@wwu.edu">textdept@wwu.edu</a>. We will get back to you as soon as possible.</p>

      <div class="content">
        <p>Materials for return for Spring 2020 are to be mailed into the bookstore with a ship date on/before April 12, 2020. This is the consistent policy we have as we need the materials back to ship out to vendors and process refunds. Our system has a limited timeline on processing intelligent refunds, which means refunding to the original form of payment. Once this time is expired, we have to have the person in store with the card or issue the refund to a bookstore gift card. Each quarter we have students with unique circumstances that the Bookstore reviews to determine if we can make an exception, with a focus on ensuring fairness and equity for all.</p>

      <div class="content">

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>&nbsp;For students who are thinking of recording a class session:</em></p>

<p>Class material falls under copyright law; recording and posting Zoom-type class sessions without the permission of the instructor is against university policy. If a student needs to record a session as part of an accommodation, the student should work with the instructor and the Disability Access Center to ensure that accommodation can be made.</p>

<p><em>For faculty in making decisions concerning recording of class sessions:</em></p>

<p>Is a consent form needed?</p>

      <div class="content">
        <p>Most standards for online education have been temporarily relaxed or suspended. However, the Dept of Education is requiring the following standard:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Instructors must initiate substantive communication with students, either individually or collectively, on a regular basis.</li>
	<li>Any synchronous class in which the instructor uses Zoom to conduct a class and interact with students meets this standard.</li>
	<li>Faculty teaching asynchronous classes could meet the standard by using Canvas discussion boards to communicate with students, setting up conference calls to facilitate group conversations, engaging in email exchanges with their students, or by interacting with all students in the evaluation of their course work.</li>

    <p>Western Washington University's main campus is situated on the ancestral homelands of the Coast Salish Peoples, who have lived in the Salish Sea basin, all throughout the San Juan Islands and the North Cascades watershed from time immemorial.  We express our deepest respect and gratitude to our indigenous neighbors, the Lummi Nation and Nooksack Tribe, for their enduring care and protection of our shared lands and waterways.</p>
