Please understand, however, that we will not know for some time (perhaps late May at the earliest) when we will be able to hold an event for several thousand people. It is reasonable to assume that we will need to reach a point at which new COVID-19 cases or hospitalizations has receded to near zero, which suggests that a June date is doubtful. Our intention is to schedule a date as soon as it is safe to do so. Potential dates include: June 27, July 25, September 5, October 17, October 31 and November 7.</p></div>

<ul>
<li>A new budget tracking feature that shows expenditures in your departments based on paid timesheets and the balance remaining for the year (available in July).</li>
<li>The ability to view student academic schedules.</li>
<li>Built-in procedures which block hiring a student into a position requiring more weekly hours than the student has available.</li>
<li>Built-in procedures which will warn you if a hire has the potential to cause your department to be over budget.</li>
<li>Built-in warnings which will notify you if a student is attempting to enter more hours in a timesheet than a student has available for that week.</li>

In the event of personal travel to these countries or locations, you will be expected to self-isolate as outlined by the CDC. Exceptions to this restriction will not be granted.

If there is a day where you are unable to perform the functions of your job because you are not feeling well or need to take care of someone in your home who is not feeling well, use a sick day. If you want to take a day off to celebrate an event or spend time on personal things, use a vacation day. Employees should record sick and vacation days on their leave card or time sheets accordingly.</p>
<p>Employees may also use portions of vacation and sick time. For example, if an employee works 4 hours in the morning but wishes to take the afternoon off, the employee can use 4 hours of vacation time or sick time (depending on the reason) to cover the afternoon.</p>
<p>Working from home may bring a level of flexibility that an employee may or may not have when coming onto campus. Be mindful of this and work with your supervisor to make your schedule fit the needs of the students and colleagues we engage with most. This new normal should not add extra stress; the college does not expect employees to now be available 24/7. But during this time employees should continue to perform the tasks essential to the success of their department and the college, our worthwhile work done well.</p></div>

One of the things the law did was expand FMLA coverage for employers with fewer than 500 employees. Because Berry College employs more than 500 employees, the act does not directly impact our employees. However, with the FMLA coverage that is currently available for Berry employees, remote work options, and vacation and sick time plans, Berry has already incorporated the items for our employees that the act was intended to address.</p></div>
