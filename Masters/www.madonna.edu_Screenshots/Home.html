                     <p>​In response to the coravirus (COVID-19) pandemic, Madonna University is continuously
                        monitoring the evolving situation in relation to all University-related activities,
                        and continues to follow state and CDC guidelines. The health and safety of our students,
                        staff, faculty, and all in the campus community remains our top priority. Work groups
                        have been formed and are developing plans to safely deliver class instruction on campus
                        in the fall. We will continue to communicate regularly with the campus community through
                        email and this webpage regarding this developing situation.

                     <p>Madonna University has activated a Task Force in response to the coronavirus (COVID-19)
                        pandemic, and it is continuously monitoring the evolving situation in relation to
                        all University-related activities. The health and safety of our students, staff, faculty,
                        and all in the campus community remains our top priority. We will communicate regularly
                        with the campus community through email and this webpage regarding this developing
                        situation.

                                       <h4>Message from Madonna University President Michael Grandillo</h4>
                                       
                                       <p>Dear Madonna University Community,</p>
                                       
                                       <p style="text-indent: 20px;">While the pandemic has changed the way we live and learn at Madonna University, it
                                          will not change the character of our faith-based mission, our culture of personally-delivered
                                          education, or our role of service to society.
                                       </p>
                                       
                                       <p style="text-indent: 20px;">Madonna will remain a vibrant, dynamic, and diverse place. In a post-pandemic world
                                          American higher education will more than likely require new economic models to sustain
                                          it. The institutions, like Madonna, that understand how educators and learners cross
                                          the limitations of the tangible and digital, will use this time of disruption for
                                          innovation.
                                       </p>
                                       
                                       <p style="text-indent: 20px;">Our students are blessed with a faculty and staff who are genuinely concerned about
                                          their success. And during these tough times, we all have been plunged into reimaging,
                                          from afar, what community and learning look like. While everyone is working hard to
                                          get it right, I understand that students may still have concerns or issues they have
                                          been unable to resolve.
                                       </p>
                                       
                                       <p style="text-indent: 20px;">I invite students who may have a question or concern to contact my office directly
                                          at <a href="mailto:president@madonna.edu">president@madonna.edu</a>. Please provide your phone number as well, so that I can communicate in the best
                                          manner possible to address your issue. I look forward to hearing from you.
                                       </p>
                                       
                                       <p style="text-indent: 20px;">I have also approved a prorated refund credit to residential students of the room
                                          and board costs for the period after they vacated the residence hall. Students left
                                          at varying times, and some students had to remain for special circumstances. The date
                                          each student moved out and the student’s financial aid package will determine the
                                          credit they receive. Residential students will be notified of their credits as soon
                                          as possible. I appreciate your patience as it may take some time for staff to process
                                          each credit individually.
                                       </p>
                                       
                                       <p style="text-indent: 20px;">We are lifted up by our more than 50,000 alumni, friends, and religious around the
                                          world who support us and send us their prayers. And I can tell you this: Madonna community
                                          members, especially alumni nurses, police officers; first responders, social workers,
                                          doctors, researchers, teachers, volunteers, and community activists, are doing everything
                                          they can in this fight against the virus. Even our nursing faculty members work in
                                          COVID-19 units on weekends.
                                       </p>
                                       
                                       <p style="text-indent: 20px;">These heroic Crusaders embody the Madonna spirit and inspire generosity and commitment.</p>
                                       
                                       <p style="text-indent: 20px;">As I’ve said before, the decision to close the campus pained me deeply. However, the
                                          stories of suffering from this virus that I have learned from reaching out to members
                                          of the Madonna family will never leave me.
                                       </p>
                                       
                                       <p style="text-indent: 20px;">We have lost relatives and friends, but we must not lose our faith or our hope. I
                                          am happy to report that the part-time employee who was COVID-19 positive has fully
                                          recovered, and I’m sure there are other stories like his.
                                       </p>
                                       
                                       <p style="text-indent: 20px;">We long to return to the way things were. Madonna’s dedicated administrative leaders
                                          and I are working hard to ready the campus to reopen in the fall. Safety will guide
                                          our responsible return to on-ground delivery of classes.
                                       </p>
                                       
                                       <p style="text-indent: 20px;">I am confident that we have the vision, creativity, and passion to adapt to the post-pandemic
                                          challenges with innovative teaching and learning pedagogies.
                                       </p>
                                       
                                       <p style="text-indent: 20px;">As a historian of the Renaissance, I know disruption births opportunity. Amid our
                                          coronavirus pain, let us find the veiled gifts that struggle begets – strength, community,
                                          compassion, and new and better models for learning and serving one another.
                                       </p>
                                       
                                       <p>Please take care of yourself and those you love.</p>
                                       
                                       <p>God bless you and God bless Madonna,</p>

                                       <p>Dear Madonna University Community,</p>
                                       
                                       <p style="text-indent: 20px;">I hope this message finds you, and those you love, safe and in good health. Please
                                          keep in your prayers those who have lost loved ones to the coronavirus, as well as
                                          those who are receiving or who are in need of care.
                                       </p>
                                       
                                       <p style="text-indent: 20px;">During this unprecedented COVID-19 pandemic, we’ve seen frequent updates, and directives
                                          provided by federal, state, and local government officials. These include maintaining
                                          social distancing through April 30; the Governor’s order, issued yesterday, expanding
                                          the State of Emergency and Disaster Declaration; and employees staying away from campus
                                          unless designated as critical infrastructure workers. We also have instituted a COVID-19
                                          health screening protocol for employees, as required by the Wayne County Health Department.
                                       </p>
                                       
                                       <p style="text-indent: 20px;">I have been monitoring this rapidly-changing situation and decided to extend the University’s
                                          online-only instruction through the 2020 Summer Semester. It distresses me, our professors,
                                          and our staff, not to have students on campus for classes and other activities. Students
                                          are why we chose to work at Madonna, and they are why we find such delight in our
                                          vocations.
                                       </p>
                                       
                                       <p style="text-indent: 20px;">I’m informing the campus community of this decision now so that we can build on the
                                          successes of this semester and continue to efficiently and effectively deliver to
                                          our students online learning of the highest quality.
                                       </p>
                                       
                                       <p>Students can register now for Summer and Fall Semester courses on MYPortal.</p>
                                       
                                       <p style="text-indent: 20px;">Earlier this week, the University was notified that a male, part-time employee had
                                          tested positive for the COVID-19 virus. The employee has not been on campus since
                                          March 7, and he has not had contact with any other employee or student. Please pray
                                          for his full recovery. The 14-day waiting period for this case is now over, and no
                                          other cases have been reported, but I am informing you today in an abundance of caution.
                                       </p>
                                       
                                       <p style="text-indent: 20px;">It would be misleading if I told you that we have all the answers, as these continue
                                          to be tough times, with new challenges at every turn. I promise, though, that we will
                                          be thoughtful in our decisions as we keep the health and safety of our campus community
                                          as a top priority. To that end, our Residence Life staff is working to encourage the
                                          remaining 60+ students still in the residence halls to move out, and we will work
                                          to provide housing for the few students who have nowhere to go.
                                       </p>
                                       
                                       <p style="text-indent: 20px;">I am so impressed by the many alumni and friends who have reached out to assist us
                                          in this crisis. Their support is much appreciated as we continue to meet our financial

                                          to working and learning online, your creativity in addressing new challenges, and
                                          your willingness to sacrifice for the good of the Madonna Community are highly commendable,
                                          and greatly appreciated. Thank you hardly seems adequate for the tireless work our
                                          faculty and staff have put forth to keep Madonna moving forward. Your innovative problem
                                          solving, and Franciscan spirit of caring and compassion have helped us keep our Madonna
                                          family members safe, while we continue fulfilling our mission. I am so proud of everyone.

                                          the Felician Franciscan values of care for one another, respect for all individuals,
                                          and commitment to do what is best for our society.

                                          measures. Based on the guidance of public health officials, higher education associations,
                                          and our dedicated Madonna Campus Health Task Force, we have made a series of operational
                                          adjustments to help keep the Madonna community safe and to mitigate the spread of

                                          Please know that it distresses all of us not to have students on campus for classes.
                                          Students are why we chose to work at Madonna, and why we take such delight in our

                                          events. This is a very sad result of the Coronavirus outbreak. I know how much celebrating
                                          commencement means to all of us, and you have our commitment, that we will celebrate

                                          to take place in the State of Michigan.

                                       <p style="text-indent: 20px;">At the beginning of this crisis, employees who could work from home were encouraged
                                          to do so, rather than come to campus. We will continue this until further notice.
                                          That means we have asked a limited staff of employees to continue to come to campus
                                          to keep certain essential functions operating, and they have all been doing a phenomenal
                                          job.

                                          are not disrupted. As a result, undergraduate and graduate enrollment offices are
                                          actively recruiting next year’s class in a virtual manner. Our advancement staff is

                                          our financial obligations during this crisis. In addition to the hope and encouragement
                                          given to us by our beloved stakeholders, your connections with each other can provide

                                       <p style="text-indent: 20px;">America, the Felician Sisters, and the Madonna community have always overcome serious
                                          challenges to serve mankind and advance Our Lord’s message of faith, hope, and love.
                                          Faith and personal prayer lift us up. With thankfulness for unanticipated and yet
                                          unseen signs of grace, we will prevail.

                                       <p style="text-indent: 20px;">It would be misleading if I told you we have all the answers, as these are tough times,
                                          and this is uncharted territory. We promise, though, that we will be thoughtful in
                                          our decisions as we keep the health and safety of our community as a top priority,
                                          while we work to be true to the values and identity of Madonna University.

                                       <p style="text-indent: 20px;">I close with a special note of gratitude to the entire Madonna Community, especially
                                          the faculty, staff, and student employees. Your nimbleness and willingness to sacrifice
                                          for the good of the Madonna Community and the greater common good are highly commendable.
                                          Our Campus Health Task Force, communications and IT teams, facilities, custodial,
                                          and residence hall teams have worked tirelessly. I know and recognize the unprecedented
