<li><strong>The need for flexibility is essential.<br />
</strong>Like all public universities in Kentucky, EKU is taking measures to help mitigate the potential impact of COVID-19 on our campuses and in the Commonwealth. Additionally, Governor Beshear has recommended that all public and private K-12 institutions within the Commonwealth suspend traditional instruction for at least the next two weeks. Both the risks associated with the virus and pressures related to care of dependents will place considerable pressure on our faculty and staff with regard to their work schedules at the University. Given these factors, it is important to be as flexible as possible with our employees&rsquo; work schedules while also ensuring that we maintain adequate staffing to meet the needs of our students, faculty, and staff colleagues.
<p>Please keep in mind that the EKU campus is not closed at this time. University offices will be open on Monday, March 16, as usual and work will go on. However, where applicable and where duties and job responsibilities held by your respective staff members can be accomplished remotely or during alternate hours, please allow your staff to take advantage of those opportunities. Not everyone has a job that is suited for remote work and we must maintain adequate staffing to keep the University running.</p>
<p>Please work directly with your managers and supervisors to ensure adequate staffing of your respective units by balancing flexibility and coverage of duties. It is essential that employees who work remotely or flex their hours are adequately supervised; have the resources needed to complete their job duties, expected tasks, and services; and are held accountable for their work. We trust our employees and want to ease the challenges associated with the COVID-19 response statewide while also ensuring that essential business continues to be conducted at the University.<br />
&nbsp;</p></li>
<li><strong>Can supervisors allow their employees to work from home?<br />
</strong>Yes, and this should be encouraged where possible until further notice. If an employee&rsquo;s duties are such that they can be carried out at home as effectively as they can in office, the employee should be encouraged to work from home, as recommended by the Office of the Governor. Supervisors must confirm with their area VP before granting permission for an employee to work from home.<br />
&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Can I bring my child with me to work?<br />
</strong>Given that the Governor has recommended closure of K-12 schools, given the University is practicing social distancing, and to comply with the University&rsquo;s liability insurance guidelines, minor children should not accompany employees to campus for their safety and ours, and to mitigate the spread of illness.<br />
&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong><strong>If an employee works from home, what are the expectations of that employee?</strong><br />
</strong>Please observe the following:
<p>- The employee must be able to perform all work necessary to their position and job duties just as they would if working in the office.</p>
<p>- Employees will be accountable for the quality and timeliness of their work in the same manner they would be accountable if working in the office.</p>
<p>- If an employee is unable to perform an essential task from home, the employee is required to notify their supervisor in a timely manner so that appropriate arrangements can be made.</p>
<p>- Employees working from home will be on duty during their regular business hours.</p>
<p>- Employees are expected to respond to all phone calls and communications in a timely manner, just as they would be required to do if working in the office.</p>
<p>- Employees must stay in frequent contact with their supervisors. Employees will be required to use vacation/sick/leave time for periods in which they are not on duty, just as they would be required to do so if working in the office.</p>
<p>- Employees must make their supervisors aware of any expected time away from their duties, just as they would be required to do so if working in the office.</p>
<p>- Supervisors have discretion to permit or deny leave time requests just as they ordinarily do.<br />
&nbsp;</p></li>
<li><strong>Can I stop by my office to collect items necessary for work?&nbsp;<br />
</strong>Yes, unless you are sick or under quarantine. The University campus is not closed, and many employees will be working on campus as usual.<br />
&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>What if I am a Designated Employee, who is required to be available for work (either at home or on campus) during an interruption or changes to normal, routine University operations?<br />
</strong>Employees who have been identified as &ldquo;Designated Employees&rdquo; will be contacted by their supervisor to affirm their work plans, either from home or on campus. Remember, the campus is not closed, and many employees, whether Designated Employees or not, will be working on campus as usual.<br />
&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Can supervisors require employees to go home?<br />
</strong>Yes. For the safety of the campus community, supervisors can require employees to leave campus. Under present circumstances, an employee will be required to either leave campus or not come to work if:
<p>- The employee is symptomatic of COVID-19 and is awaiting possible diagnosis, or has been diagnosed as having COVID-19.</p>
<p>-&nbsp;The employee has been in recent close contact with someone who is symptomatic of COVID-19 and is awaiting diagnosis, or who has been diagnosed as having COVID-19.</p>
<p>-&nbsp;The employee has recently traveled to a country or region that has been deemed by the Centers for Disease Control as a Warning Level 3 area or higher.</p>
<p>-&nbsp;The employee has been in recent close contact with someone who has traveled to a country or region that has been deemed by the Centers for Disease Control as a Warning Level 3 area or higher.</p>
<p>-&nbsp;Other circumstances as necessary where an employee&rsquo;s presence might imperil the safety of University employees, students, and/or the public.<br />
&nbsp;</p></li>
<li><strong>Can an employee refuse to go home?<br />
</strong>No. Employees who refuse to abide by a supervisor&rsquo;s directive to leave campus could be found in violation of the University&rsquo;s Progressive Disciplinary Action Policy (8.3.4R), which prohibits behavior by employees that imperils the safety of University employees or the public.<br />
&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>If I am required to leave campus because I am symptomatic of, or been diagnosed with, COVID-19, how long will I be required to stay off campus?</strong><br />
Please follow the guidance and recommendations of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as well as your physician and local and state government health officials. Please also keep in frequent contact with your supervisor as to your anticipated date of return. In all circumstances you must not return to campus until you have been cleared by either your primary healthcare professional or the local health department. The overall goal is to not pose an increased risk of spreading COVID-19 to others.<br />
&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>What should I do if I&rsquo;m not sure about coming in to work, because I am symptomatic of COVID-19?</strong><br />
You should err on the side of caution in all circumstances. Please contact a medical professional, stay home, and contact Human Resources and your supervisor as soon as possible to discuss your individual situation and appropriate plans will be arranged.<br />
&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>If I am sent home, will I still get paid?</strong><br />
Please observe the following chart. The information below is for general information only and will be in effect only until COVID-19 no longer poses a primary concern for the community. The information below is subject to change without notice. Due to the unique and emergency nature of the circumstances, individual situations will vary depending on multiple circumstances pertaining to those situations. Please contact Human Resources for specific information, including information about approvals, about your own unique situation.</li>
