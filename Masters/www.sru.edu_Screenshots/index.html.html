<h2>What is novel coronavirus?</h2>
<p>A novel coronavirus is a new coronavirus that has not been previously identified. The virus causing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), is not the same as the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/types.html">coronaviruses that commonly circulate among humans</a> and cause mild illness, like the common cold.</p>
<h2>How is it spread?</h2>
<p>The virus that causes COVID-19 is thought to spread mainly from person to person, mainly through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or talks. These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs. Spread is more likely when people are in close contact with one another (within about 6 feet).</p>
<p>COVID-19 seems to be spreading easily and sustainably in the community (“community spread”) in many affected geographic areas. Community spread means people have been infected with the virus in an area, including some who are not sure how or where they became infected.</p>

<p>To learn more, visit the Center for Disease Control and Prevention <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/faq.html">COVID-19 FAQ webpage.</a></p>
<!----------------------- END ACCORDION ------------------>

<h2>How do I prevent getting the Coronavirus?</h2>
					<p>Currently, there are no vaccines available to prevent COVID-19 infection.  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends typical infectious disease precautions, just as those used to prevent cold or flu:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. Use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer if soap and water are not available.</li>
						<li>Avoid touching your mouth, nose and eyes.</li>
						<li>Cover coughs and sneezes with your arm or a tissue.</li>
						<li>Avoid exposure to others who are sick.</li>
						<li>Stay home while you are ill (except to visit a healthcare professional) and avoid close contact with others.</li>
						<li>Get adequate sleep and eat well-balanced meals to ensure a healthy immune system.</li>
						<li>Clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>The CDC advises the use of simple cloth face coverings to slow the spread of the virus and help people who may have the virus and do not know it from transmitting it to others. Cloth face coverings fashioned from household items or made at home from common materials at low cost can be used as an additional public health measure. Wear cloth face coverings in public settings where other social distancing measures are difficult to maintain (e.g., grocery stores and pharmacies), especially in areas of significant community-based transmission. For more information from the CDC, <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/diy-cloth-face-coverings.html" target="_blank">click here</a>.</p>
