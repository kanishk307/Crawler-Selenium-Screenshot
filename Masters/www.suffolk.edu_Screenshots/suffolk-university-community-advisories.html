                                <p>Dear Colleagues,</p>
<p>As planning for the fall semester and the gradual reopening of campus operations and activities continues, I write to update you with some details on current expectations for employees, some planning principles, and a preliminary timetable for additional information.</p>
<p>As previously announced, all summer classes will be held online, and in most cases, we will continue to operate remotely until at least July 1. Essential personnel will continue to provide critical services that are required on campus, but most employees should expect to work remotely through the end of June, and perhaps longer.</p>
<p>The health and safety of our students and employees remains paramount. We are using the rest of May and the month of June to further plan for gradual reopening of on-campus operations, with the intention of keeping these to a minimum for most of the summer. Our on-campus operations will gradually expand as we move toward the fall. All of this will be done in line with public health guidance and the requirements provided by the state and city.</p>
<p>As you know, a number of University working groups are developing plans for the fall semester and will make recommendations to the University's COVID-19 task force on academic activities, student life, health and safety, and other areas. A link to the various planning groups working on preparations and policies can be found on <a href="/about/president-leadership/provost">the Provost's Office web page</a>. Among those groups, the Safe Actions for Employee Return (SAFER) group, led by Chief Human Resources Officer Boris Lazic, will make recommendations on the policies, processes, changes in operation, and communication that we need to bring employees back to campus in a safe, orderly, and strategic fashion. SAFER is a University-wide group that includes representatives of exempt and non-exempt employees, as well as employees who are student facing and those who are not, and academic representation from all three schools.</p>
<p>Senior Associate Provost Gary Fireman is working with the Office of Environmental Health and Safety and faculty to develop a process to safely allow resumption of certain research laboratory activities, in line with Phase 1 of the governor's guidelines for Massachusetts.</p>
<p>The planning groups will make recommendations to the University task force by the first week in June, and the task force will in turn make recommendations to me.</p>
<p>I will update you with further details, including preliminary FY21 budget actions, through a virtual town hall meeting for employees to be held at 2 p.m. Wednesday, June 10. The town hall also will include other members of the University's leadership team. Specific details about accessing that town hall meeting will be communicated in the coming days.</p>
<p>Again, all of the ongoing planning for the fall will be done in accordance with guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and state and local health officials, as well as with the governor and mayor's guidelines for institutes of higher education, which are still under development.</p>
<p>I continue to wish you and your families good health and a happy Memorial Day weekend to all.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Marisa Kelly<br />
President</p>

                                <p>Dear Colleagues,</p>
<p>As you know, it has been our hope to hold a face-to-face commencement for the class of 2020 this August. We believe that the public health situation will not allow us to do so. As such, we now hope to hold a ceremony for the class of 2020 in May of 2021.</p>
<p>The message below was sent to our recent graduates yesterday. While it is difficult to wait a full year, we will look forward to celebrating the class of 2020 and their many accomplishments at that time.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Marisa Kelly<br />
President</p>
<p>_________________________________________________________________</p>
<p>To our graduating students,</p>
<p>On behalf of the entire Suffolk community, I want to offer my sincere congratulations on completing your Suffolk degrees. Your achievements would be impressive under normal circumstances. But those accomplishments are all the more remarkable in the face of a pandemic that has caused both tragedy, distress, and dramatic changes in the way you have had to live and learn. For all that you have accomplished in the face of extreme adversity, we are very proud of you. You have proven beyond measure that you are determined, resilient, and creative in how you approach your work. That will serve you well as you pursue your professional and personal goals, both now and over the course of your lives.</p>
<p>Gathering to celebrate your accomplishments remains one of the University's highest priorities. In March I told you we would postpone rather than cancel Commencement ceremonies. While some universities were shifting to virtual graduations, I have felt that this moment is so important to you, your loved ones, and to this University community that we need to come together and celebrate in person, if at all possible. As much as we wanted to commence on our scheduled date this month, the pandemic made that impossible, and I know that has been so very disappointing. For that reason, we had hoped to schedule a commencement celebration in August. But we expect public health conditions and guidelines will continue to prevent large groups to safely gather, so we have looked further out on the calendar.</p>
<p>While I wish it could be sooner, I am pleased to announce that we have scheduled a Commencement celebration for the class of 2020 to be held on Sunday, May 23, 2021-- just over a year from now -- at the Rockland Trust Bank Pavilion in Boston. Exploration of earlier dates this coming fall made clear that a celebration at that time would be highly unlikely. I am guardedly confident that by May of 2021 public health conditions and guidelines will allow us to bring our graduates and their families safely together to celebrate. We looked to pick a time that gave us the best chance of being able to move forward with celebrations while allowing as many graduates and their families as possible to attend. The planned Commencement celebration schedule is:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Sawyer Business School at 9 a.m.</li>
    <li>College of Arts &amp; Sciences at 1:30 p.m.</li>
    <li>Law School at 5:30 p.m. </li>
</ul>
<p>We will celebrate the graduating class of 2021 on the following day.</p>
<p>Yours will be a unique celebration, reflecting what has been a distinct experience for the class of 2020. Even as we honor your academic accomplishments, we will mark your return as members of our alumni community. I hope you will save the date for a celebration that we hope will be worth waiting for and one to remember. If you have completed your degree program and other requirements, you are a graduate of this institution as of yesterday, May 17, 2020. Diplomas are being mailed to graduates now.</p>
<p>Again, please accept my heartiest congratulations on your accomplishments and my wishes for your continued health and safety and that of your loved ones.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Marisa Kelly<br />
President</p>

                                <p>To our students,</p>
<p>I hope that this email finds you and your families safe and well. My thoughts have been with you during exam week and as a semester that none of us will ever forget comes to a close. Despite all of the challenges, including the shift to virtual learning, I hope you have had a successful academic year.</p>
<p>The University is at this moment engaged in an extensive planning process to ensure that in the coming academic year we will be prepared to provide our students with the transformational educational experiences that are at the heart of a Suffolk education. It is too soon to know the exact conditions in which we will operate at the start of the fall semester, or all of the public health recommendations pertaining to COVID-19 that will guide us. Planning, however, is moving forward, and we are preparing for a number of scenarios, always with the health and safety of our students and employees as our highest priority.</p>
<p>While there is much that remains unknown, I can tell you with certainty that Suffolk University will be open this fall and fully prepared to deliver on our educational mission. We will start our academic year according to our normal calendar. It is our hope and intention to hold in-person classes and activities at our Boston and Madrid campuses. However, to ensure the health and safety of our community and the broader public, we are also very likely to need a mix of face-to-face and virtual operations that allow for social distancing. We are engaged in careful planning so that we are ready for a wide range of possibilities, and final decisions will be made in light of guidelines set by government and public health officials.</p>
<p>Groups made up of administrators and faculty with expertise from across the University are working to address scenarios related to course delivery and schedules, campus and residence hall life, the cocurricular experience, international programs, and of course, health and safety. A health subcommittee is developing medical and health guidelines to limit the risk of COVID-19 transmission and to protect Suffolk community members, including medically vulnerable populations, as the University transitions back to campus in the fall. That committee will make recommendations on precautionary measures we can take to reduce risk, including social distancing, face covering, accommodations and protections for vulnerable populations, and other areas. COVID-19 testing and contact tracing will be integrated into our operational plan for the fall.</p>
<p>The recommendations from these working groups will be gathered by the COVID-19 Task Force that has been operating since early March, and will inform the final decisions made about the next academic year and the specifics of our operations. We will update you with details on our plans as soon as they become available. We know international students may face special challenges, especially related to visas. A more detailed message from Vice President of International Affairs Sebasti&aacute;n Royo will be forthcoming for those students.</p>
<p>In the meantime, please know that we are committed to our mission and to all of you. We will chart a course for the fall designed to continue to help you achieve your educational goals in and out of the classroom. And until we gather together again, whether in person or virtually, we want to stay connected. Please do not hesitate to reach out to a faculty member, an adviser, to a mentor in your school or in Student Affairs if you have questions. We are here to support you.</p>
<p>My continued best wishes for your health and safety and that of all your loved ones.</p>

                                <p> Dear Members of the Suffolk University Community,</p>
<p>Earlier this month President Kelly informed you that the University will deliver the first summer session course modules -- those that begin May 18 -- through online or remote instruction. That decision was based on public health recommendations pertaining to the COVID-19 pandemic and ongoing uncertainty as to when stay-at-home guidance would be lifted.</p>
<p>We understand that students and faculty also need to know whether summer classes in the latter part of the summer will be held in person or online. Because we have the capacity to hold most of these classes online, we have decided that the remainder of our summer classes will be held online, even once the campus re-opens for many functions.</p>
<p>It is our hope and intention that staff will be returning to campus over the summer, and we will resume on-campus operations. The specific timeline for that is not yet clear, and those decisions will, of course, be informed by public health guidelines. However, moving all summer courses online at this point will reduce the uncertainty for students, including those who are asking whether they need to be physically present on campus for a summer course. Knowing summer classes will be online may also help students with the decision to take advantage of summer coursework to advance in their programs of study or fulfill other requirements.</p>
<p>As always, thank you for your continued flexibility and adaptability as the University works to ensure uninterrupted instruction and learning during this public health crisis.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Julie Sandell<br />
Provost</p>

                                <p>Dear Members of the Suffolk Community,</p>
<p>The University has made the decision to deliver summer session courses that begin May 18 through online or remote instruction, as we are doing in the current semester. This decision is based on current public health recommendations pertaining to the COVID-19 pandemic and ongoing uncertainties as to when stay-at-home guidance will be lifted. The decision also reflects our commitment to the health and safety of our students and employees while ensuring our students' ability to move forward with coursework.</p>
<p>We have also considered that remote instruction over the summer may be of value to students in this current environment. Some students may find that access to online courses this summer will be helpful in staying on their academic paths, getting ahead in their programs of study, or fulfilling other requirements. For example, Suffolk online courses are counted towards the residency requirement for seniors, even when living on campus is not possible.</p>
<p>The three different summer modules--Summer 1, Summer A, and Summer 3--which all begin May 18 but end on different dates, will be held online. We expect that our normal grading policies will be in effect.</p>
<p>Later this spring we will make a decision regarding modules that begin later in the summer.</p>
<p>Again, my thanks to all of our students, faculty, and staff for their dedication to ensuring that teaching and learning at Suffolk continue uninterrupted.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>

                                <p>Dear Members of the Suffolk Community,</p>
<p>We write to update you on the number of positive tests for COVID-19 among Suffolk employees and students, as well as to share how future community updates on these numbers will be made.</p>
<p>To date, a total of eight members of the Suffolk community have reported being tested positive for COVID-19 and all are receiving appropriate care. These individuals include six students and two employees. Half of the students experienced symptoms and were diagnosed outside of the United States. All eight of these individuals at the most recent reports have recovered or are recovering well.</p>
<p>As described in previous University communications, Suffolk continues to follow the guidance and recommendations of public health authorities with regard to COVID-19 cases in our community. City and state public health authorities have a standard communication protocol that includes notification of people who have had direct exposure to an ill individual. While we will keep the campus community updated on how COVID-19 is affecting our community, to reiterate, exposure notifications for individuals are made by public health authorities.</p>
<p>As the University and the city of Boston continue to plan for an extended period of concern regarding COVID-19, Suffolk will regularly update the Coronavirus Advisory page with the known number of positive COVID-19 diagnosed cases in our Suffolk community.</p>
<p>Following Boston Public Health Commission and Massachusetts Department of Public Health guidance in support of community health remains a priority for the University, as does maintaining privacy for affected members of our community. It is important that the Suffolk community respects the privacy of individuals diagnosed with COVID-19, as we would for anyone with a health concern.</p>
<p>During this challenging time for our community, our city, the nation, and the world, we know that students and employees may have specific questions and concerns regarding COVID-19.</p>
<ul>

                                <p>Dear Colleagues,</p>
<p>In the face of the COVID-19 pandemic, the University is working with Mayor Walsh and the city of Boston in support of the city's response planning. Today, the mayor announced a comprehensive plan for individuals experiencing homelessness in the city of Boston during the COVID-19 public health emergency. As part of that plan, the University is making Miller Hall, with its 172 rooms, available for city needs as it responds to the public health crisis and supports Boston's most vulnerable.</p>
<p>We have notified the 22 students living in Miller Hall that we will be working in the coming days to relocate them to the Modern Theatre Residence Hall. We understand that this is an inconvenience for those students, and we very much appreciate their understanding and commitment to supporting the city that is their home. Facilities staff will assist with the moves and work to minimize any disruption to those students. As you know, the vast majority of our students have left the residence halls, so we do have enough space to ensure that we can provide them with the appropriate space for social distancing and safety.</p>
<p>During this temporary use, The Boston Public Health Commission will manage the facility in collaboration with the Pine Street Inn.</p>
<p>Mayor Walsh has been clear that the precautions and preparations the city, its institutions, and its residents take now will be critical to successfully responding to the crisis. We commend him for his leadership, and we stand ready to help in any way. Boston is our home, and the University takes very seriously its responsibility to be a good citizen at a time when we are all being called upon to pitch in and help.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>

<p>In the face of the COVID-19 pandemic, the University is working with Mayor Walsh and the city of Boston in support of the city's response planning. That includes making Miller Hall available for city needs as it responds to the public health crisis and supports the city's most vulnerable who are impacted by COVID-19.</p>
<p>In the next few days, we will be working with you and other Miller Hall residents currently living on campus to relocate you to the Modern Theatre Residence Hall. To minimize the stress of moving and disruption to your schedule, our facilities staff will transport your belongings to the Modern Theatre. As you know, the vast majority of our students have left the residence halls, so we do have enough space to ensure that we can provide you with the appropriate space for social distancing and safety. Residence Life and Housing will communicate with you directly about this.</p>
<p>For those of you who have moved from Miller Hall but left your belongings to be picked-up at later date, University staff will pack your belongs and store them for you on campus. However, if you prefer to come to campus to pick up your belongings in the next few days, you may do so by contacting reslife@suffolk.edu. </p>
<p>Mayor Walsh has been clear that the precautions and preparations the city, its institutions, and its residents take now will be critical to successfully responding to the crisis. We commend him for his leadership, and we stand ready to help in any way. Boston is our home, and the University takes very seriously its responsibility to be a good citizen at a time when we are all being called upon to pitch in and help.</p>
<p>We know this is an inconvenience and appreciate your understanding. Every effort will be made so your relocation to the Modern Theatre is as smooth as possible. We know the city of Boston is your home, too, and we thank you for your ongoing commitment to our great city.</p>
<p>Please stay safe and watch for an email from Residence Life and Housing.</p>

                                <p>Dear Suffolk Students,</p>
<p>I hope that you and your loved ones are well and safe. I am writing to inform you of significant changes in our grading policy for both undergraduate students and graduate students in the College of Arts and Sciences and the Sawyer Business School for the Spring, 2020 semester. A similar message is going to the students in the Law School.</p>
<p>In order to acknowledge the challenges that many of you have experienced because of the abrupt changes in instruction, living situations and daily life necessitated by the COVID-19 public health crisis, all students who receive a course grade other than F for a Spring 2020 course will have the option to convert that grade to a P for their official transcript. This will accommodate those of you who would like the letter grades you have earned to appear as part of your official record, and will provide flexibility to those of you who may have found yourself in a very challenging situation that might have impacted your grades, despite your best efforts. We cannot answer every question or address every situation in this communication, so please contact your Dean's office with additional questions. </p>
<p>The policy has the following components:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Faculty will issue grades as usual for all students as outlined in the course syllabus. This may be a letter grade (most courses, most students) or a P/F grade (because the course was Pass/Fail by design, or because the student originally elected to take a graded course on a P/F basis). It is important that faculty issue the grade earned by each student in each course.</li>
    <li>After final grades have been submitted, you will access your MySuffolk/WebAdvisor account to review the final letter grades issued to you. Grades are due on May 7th. Through May 11th, you will have the option to choose a "P" to replace any letter grade you have received other than an "F," for your official transcript. In other words, you can leave your letter grades as assigned to appear on your transcript, or you can convert one or more of your non-F grades to a "P." Only letter grades are included in GPA calculations. You should make this decision carefully with guidance from your respective Dean's Office or from an academic advisor in the Undergraduate Academic Advising Center, academicadvising@suffolk.edu. Graduate students, please consult with your Graduate Program Advisor.</li>
    <li>We recognize that letter grades are fundamental elements for grade-based internal processes and certain program requirements. Because faculty will be assigning grades as usual, those grades will be available for internal processes, including progression decisions for INTO students, even when you have elected to have a P replace a letter grade for one or more courses on your transcript. We also recognize that letter grades on the transcript may be required for external purposes, such as licensure requirements, graduate school admission and the like. We will maintain an internal record of the letter grades assigned, in the event that you need to provide a letter grade for a Spring 2020 course at some point in the future. </li>
    <li>For the Spring 2020 semester, P grades may be applied to courses that are part of major requirements, degree requirements, and elective courses, with the exception of any specific accreditation, licensure or other restrictions. The deans will be reaching out to specific programs regarding these restrictions.</li>
    <li>Any courses in which you replace letter grades with P grades during the Spring 2020 semester will not be counted toward our internal credit limit for P/F courses, due to the extraordinary nature of the semester.</li>
</ol>
<p>Please accept my sincere thanks for the many ways, large and small, that the students have risen to the occasion in moving to the online learning environment. I hope that this flexible Pass/Fail policy will balance the needs of as many students as possible.</p>
<p>With best wishes for your continued health and safety,</p>
<p>Julie Sandell<br />

                                <p>Dear Members of the Suffolk Community,</p>
<p>I write to update you on the latest developments related to COVID-19, as they affect the University and our community.</p>
<p>First, as you may be aware, Governor Charlie Baker this morning announced an executive order that directs all non-essential businesses to close their "brick-and-mortar" operations in Massachusetts from noon tomorrow (March 24) through April 7. Businesses are encouraged to continue operations remotely, as Suffolk has been doing. The order to close includes language that permits college and university employees to maintain essential campus services, including facilitating distance learning and providing residential and food services to students who remain on campus. As such, Suffolk University will continue to provide remote instruction and services to our students, and to support the housing of the small number of students who have remained in our residence halls.</p>
<p>In light of the governor's announcement, however, we are instructing non-essential workers not to come to campus after noon tomorrow. We will be communicating separately with groups and individuals that are still permitted to come to campus under the new guidelines from the state. If you are not contacted separately please assume that you should only be working remotely. Please note that while we strongly encourage faculty to deliver online material remotely, some faculty members may need to use on-campus facilities or equipment. These individuals should be able to come onto campus for that limited purpose, as they will fall within one of the categories of essential personnel.</p>
<p>Separately, I want to update the community on several incidences of students testing positive for COVID-19. We have been made aware of five separate positive tests involving students. All of those students are receiving appropriate medical care from providers as well as appropriate follow-up from public health authorities where they are located. In addition, medical providers in Suffolk's Counseling Health &amp; Wellness Office are offering their support. We are grateful that all of those students are recovering well.</p>
<p>The University has established protocols related to any case of COVID-19. We are in close contact with public health authorities and following their guidance and directives. The Boston Public Health Commission and the Massachusetts Department of Public Health have made appropriate notifications, and the University has not been made aware of any direct exposures within the Suffolk community, with the exception of one student who was contacted and has been appropriately isolating with no symptoms.</p>
<p>It is of the utmost importance that we respect the privacy of these individuals, as we do for anyone who experiences a health issue.</p>
<p>The health, safety, and well-being of our entire community remains our top priority. We will continue to keep the University informed about the impact of COVID-19 on our campus community, and we encourage you to monitor this page for the latest updates.</p>
<p>As you continue or begin to work from home, please be reassured that we will continue to move forward as a community, delivering on our commitments to our students but also to one another. Take time to care for your own mental and physical health during this challenging time, and please know that I look forward to seeing you all back on Suffolk's campus when the crisis subsides. We will get through this. </p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>

The Library, computer labs, classrooms and the Bookstore will be closed. You will not be able to access your lockers after noon tomorrow (March 24). The Sargent Hall Caf&eacute; will remain open on a reduced schedule for take-out only for the use of our students currently living on campus.</p>
<h4>Members of Our Community Diagnosed with COVID-19</h4>
<p>I want to update the community on several incidences of students testing positive for COVID-19. We have been made aware of five separate positive tests involving students. All of those students are receiving appropriate medical care from providers as well as appropriate follow up from their respective public health authority groups. In addition, medical providers in Suffolk's Counseling Health &amp; Wellness Office are offering their support.&nbsp;We are grateful that all of those students are recovering well.</p>

<p>We will continue to keep the University informed about the impact of COVID-19 on our campus community, and we encourage you to monitor this page for the latest updates.</p>
<h4>Grading &amp; Pass Fail</h4>
<p>The University is currently reviewing the possibility of permitting students to receive pass/fail grades for spring semester 2020 courses. A decision will be made about this shortly and you will be informed via email.</p>
<h4>Remote Student Resources Available</h4>
<p>Our campus departments and staff are committed to providing you with the services you need to be academically and personally successful. Whether it's talking with a personal counselor or the chaplain or speaking with an academic advisor to select your courses for next semester or strategizing with an academic coach or tutor to do your very best work or getting help from the Library staff to identify on-line resources; we remain ready to support you.</p>
<p>Please contact&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="mailto:covidsupport@suffolk.edu" target="_blank">Suffolk CARES</a>&nbsp;regarding food insecurity and emergency, and internet and computer needs, we remain ready to support you. We are ensuring key library resources are available remotely,&nbsp;and we will continue to assess and take similar steps as needed.</p>
<p>A listing of <a href="/about/directory">campus offices</a>&nbsp;with contact information is available&nbsp;in our directory.&nbsp;The university staff directory&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://portalpro.suffolk.edu/dir/faculty-staff/" target="_blank" alt="https://portalpro.suffolk.edu/dir/faculty-staff/">is also available</a>.&nbsp;We encourage you to send emails to faculty and staff rather than calling. Faculty and staff will respond promptly.</p>
<h4>Bookstore</h4>
<p>Although the <a rel="noopener noreferrer" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.bkstr.com/suffolkubookstore" target="_blank" alt="http://www.suffolkstore.com">Bookstore</a> is closed for walk-in business, the Bookstore staff will be responding to orders for hardcopy books and rental books.</p>
<p>The Bookstore website is offering FREE GROUND SHIPPING on all orders.&nbsp; Contact them by phone at 617-227-8874 or&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="mailto:0965asm@follett.com" target="_blank">by email</a>.</p>
<p>Text Rental Program:&nbsp;&nbsp; The rental check-in date will be extended by ten days (to May 19, 2020). Students can return their rentals for free and gain access to a complimentary shipping label at the bookstore website. by logging in, selecting "My Account" and then "Rental."</p>
<p>There are currently no discounts being offered on textbooks and the online buy-back program has been halted.</p>
<h4>Attendance &amp; Absences</h4>
<p>Given the unprecedented situation with COVID-19, faculty will use a variety of methods to convey course material remotely. Instructors will communicate directly with you about this.</p>
<p>You are expected to log in (if appropriate) and stay current with your coursework at the direction of your faculty. While faculty will be asked to accommodate individual situations, the existing&nbsp;<a href="/student-life/student-services/student-handbook/university-policies-for-students-cas-sbs/attendance-absences">Attendance and Absence Policy</a>&nbsp;will remain in place. If you become ill, you should directly communicate with your faculty to request an excused absence. Consider keeping copies of all emails you send to faculty as well as work submitted.</p>
<p>So the University can monitor illness among students in virtual classes, you are strongly encouraged to submit an&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://suffolk.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_50i2obYkhy2yTgp" target="_blank" alt="https://suffolk.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_50i2obYkhy2yTgp">Absence Notification Form</a>. Upon receipt of your absence notification form, the Student Affairs Office will inform faculty of the date(s) of your absence(s). Completion of this form will not take the place of your directly communicating with your faculty about how you can be successful in class.</p>
<h4>Prorated Room and Remaining Board Refunds</h4>
<p>We appreciate your patience while the Bursar's Office works to refund the prorated room and remaining board charges of residence students who have moved out of housing. We estimate that all refunds will be made by March 31 according to the following schedule:</p>
<ul>
    <li>If the student currently has an outstanding balance on their student account they will receive a credit to their student account in the amount of the refund. In the event that the refund is in excess of the outstanding balance, the student will receive the remaining amount via direct deposit or check mailed to their address on file.</li>
    <li>If the student is signed up to pay Suffolk using a monthly payment plan, the payment plan balance will be reduced by the amount of the credit due to the student. In the event the credit is in excess of the payment plan balance, the student will receive the remaining amount via direct deposit or check mailed to their address on file.</li>
    <li>All students that don't fall in the two above scenarios will receive their full refund via direct deposit or check mailed to their address on file.</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, I thank you for your patience and resilience during this time of uncertainty. We are here to support you and help you to succeed. Please let us know how we can help.</p>
<p>Wishing you all good health,</p>

                            <div class="panel-body">
                                <p>Dear Students,</p>
<p>My thoughts have been with you since this health crisis began, and they are with you at this moment. I hope that you and your family and friends are healthy and safe. I hope that you are connecting with friends, even though that needs to be remotely. Maintaining that strong sense of community is more important now than ever. I also hope that you are adjusting to online instruction, and that you are feeling supported as you continue on this semester, one that has changed in ways we never could have imagined in January when it began.</p>
<p>I want you to know that I understand how disappointing it is for you not to be able to participate in so many of the activities that are such an important part of your Suffolk experience. We are all doing our best in a challenging situation. I am proud of the commitment of our faculty and staff to ensure your learning continues through virtual course delivery and virtual support services. And most of all, I am proud of you for adjusting to this new and temporary Suffolk experience.</p>
<p>But even as we move forward together, I want you to know that I do understand this is not the semester you hoped to have, nor the one we planned to give you. A great number of the things that you love to do are not possible in this environment--at least not in the way we are accustomed. Many of you have had to say goodbye to friends for the semester and move out of residence halls or return early from wonderful experiences abroad. Student clubs and activities have had to move online. Athletic programs and competitions have stopped. Enjoying time with friends is no longer possible in person. I want to express my sorrow at this. But I am so grateful for your flexibility and your commitment to ensuring that we are all doing everything we can to support each other and to ensure the safety of the Suffolk community and the broader community.</p>
<h4>To the Class of 2020</h4>
<p>I want to directly address the members of the Class of 2020&mdash;our seniors, graduate students, and law students who will finish their degrees this spring. This change in how we live our lives in the face of a global pandemic has been particularly hard for many of you. I know you had different ideas of how your final semester at Suffolk would play out, and that the inability to participate in important activities, events, and gatherings has been profoundly disappointing.</p>
<p>For good reason, a big question on many of your minds right now is Commencement. Current public health and government guidance suggests that moving forward with our scheduled May Commencement will be impossible. The indications are that large gatherings will not be permitted at least through the first part of May. Because we need to make a decision long before then, and so much of the preparation must take place far in advance, it is virtually impossible to envision a scenario where we could hold Commencement on May 17. So we will postpone the celebration, but we will not cancel it.</p>
<p>We are working to identify a date in August to hold our Commencement celebration. It could be one large event or several smaller ones. We will provide more details when they are available. If the public health crisis has not subsided enough to celebrate all of you in August, we will look for another alternative. Commencement is such an important and meaningful occasion for you, your families, and for the Suffolk community. We must find a way to celebrate together. I want the opportunity to congratulate you all one by one (even if we cannot shake hands), recognizing you for your achievements, and inviting you to continue to engage with us as Suffolk alumni. We will do everything we can to hold an in-person celebration. I appreciate your patience as we continue to work through the details.</p>
<p>However, I also want to be clear that you will receive your degrees in May. Students who have completed their program requirements will become graduates of this institution at that time, with all of the rights and responsibilities associated with their degree, even though our community celebration has been delayed.</p>
<p>To all of our students: Please stay connected. Continue to take advantage of support services remotely. Our faculty members and staff are here to help you, as they always have been. Reach out to them. And to me. Support each other. Share what's happening in your lives through social media. Or there's always Zoom! I believe we will emerge from this as a more connected community, stronger, and even kinder. Remember, we are Suffolk University, and we are a powerful force for good. The good that we do as a community will continue, even in the face of the most trying of circumstances.</p>
<p>I wish all of you the best in the coming weeks, and most importantly good health to you and your loved ones.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Marisa Kelly<br />
President</p>

                                <p>Dear Student Worker,</p>
<p>Thank you for your patience as the University navigates the transition to a remote campus environment. While we had hoped to allow student workers to continue to work on campus, health and safety concerns no longer allow for this possibility.</p>
<p>As we previously indicated, we are strongly encouraging all student workers to speak with their supervisor about the feasibility of remote work. Any student worker who receives authorization to work remotely will continue to receive pay according to the normal procedures and will have the opportunity to earn all funds awarded for the spring 2020 semester.</p>
<p>We do also recognize there are a group of students who are not able to perform their responsibilities as a student worker in a remote environment. The University understands this has caused financial difficulty for many of you. To assist with this situation, student workers who are not able to work remotely will be compensated with a portion of their spring employment award. In addition, the University will work to identify remote opportunities that would allow you to earn a greater portion. Students who exhausted their spring employment funding prior to the University's remote transition will not be eligible to receive additional compensation.</p>
<p>As information on remote student work becomes available, we will provide it to you and your supervisor. Should remote work become an option in the future, you would be paid for the hours worked.</p>
<p>We will be contacting your supervisors next week to collect information as to your remote work status. If you have not yet communicated with your supervisor, please do so immediately.</p>
<p>Details on the timing of this payment will be forthcoming, after we are able to determine the group of students who will be compensated.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>

                                <p>Dear Suffolk Students,</p>
<p>My thoughts are with all of you as we face this public health crisis together. Your safety and the safety of your families is paramount in this difficult time.</p>
<p>As we continue to carefully follow the guidance and recommendations of public health authorities, the University has made the decision that our workforce will work remotely starting tomorrow (Thursday March 19), except for essential personnel. That means that the University will be shifting to remote student services, including advising, medical care, personal counseling and other resources. Classes will continue on-line, while the libraries will be closed and campus offices and individual employees will be conducting business remotely. Student workers should not report for work on campus. Please contact your manager to discuss possible remote work assignments, and expect a separate communication from us next week if you are a Suffolk student worker.</p>
<h4>Remote Student Services</h4>
<p>Our campus departments and staff are committed to providing you with the services you need to be academically and personally successful. Whether it's talking with a personal counselor or the chaplain or speaking with an academic advisor to select your courses for next semester or strategizing with an academic coach or tutor to do your very best work or getting help from the Library staff to identify on-line resources, or seeking services from <a href="/student-life/student-services/student-affairs/suffolk-cares">Suffolk CARES</a>&nbsp;regarding food insecurity and emergency needs, we remain ready to support you. We are working to ensure that all students (commuter or in residence) who need to use Suffolk computers have access to them.&nbsp;We are ensuring key library resources are available remotely,&nbsp;and we will continue to assess and take similar steps as needed.</p>
<p>A listing of campus offices with contact information is available <a href="/about/directory">in our directory</a>.&nbsp;The university staff directory <a rel="noopener noreferrer" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://portalpro.suffolk.edu/dir/faculty-staff/" target="_blank">is also available</a>.&nbsp;We encourage you to send emails to faculty and staff rather than calling. Faculty and staff will respond promptly.</p>
<h4>Essential personnel</h4>
<p>Essential personnel will report to work daily and will continue to support the safety and well-being of our remaining residential students on campus, and we will support all of our students, living on campus or at home, with high-quality on-line education and on-line access to academic and personal support services. Online classes are underway. We have and will continue to communicate with those essential workers who need to be on campus for purposes of supporting students still living in our residence halls, meeting their food service needs, ensuring campus safety and security and for other reasons.</p>

                                <p>Dear Members of the Suffolk Community,</p>
<p>My thoughts are with all of you as we face this public health crisis together. Your safety and the safety of your families is paramount in this difficult time.</p>
<p>As we continue to carefully follow the guidance and recommendations of public health authorities, the University has made the decision that our workforce should work remotely starting tomorrow (Thursday, March 19), except for essential personnel.</p>
<p>Essential personnel will continue to support the safety and well-being of our remaining residential students on campus, and we will support all of our students, living on campus or at home, with high-quality online education and online access to academic support services. Online classes are underway as of today, and we are moving forward together.</p>
<p>Even as we do so, for the health and safety of our community, and to ensure that we contribute to the health of the wider community, we ask that you not come to campus and instead work remotely, except in cases where a campus presence is required. We have and will continue to communicate with those essential workers who need to be on campus for purposes of supporting students still living in our residence halls, meeting their food service needs, ensuring campus safety and security, and for other reasons. Please note that any position may be designated as essential at any point during an emergency, even if not seen as essential outside of that situation. There may also be a need for non-essential workers to occasionally or intermittently come to campus to complete critical tasks or functions that cannot be done remotely but that are needed to keep University operations moving forward. Again, managers will be in touch with any employees who might be required to intermittently be on campus. Given the dramatically reduced presence on campus through this temporary remote-work policy, we will be able to fully ensure proper social distancing as recommended by public health authorities.</p>
<p>We ask that employees who are healthy and home continue to work. We all need to work together--even from our own homes--to ensure that we are supporting our students and providing them with the education and services they need to be successful. Your work is just as important, if not more important to the University during this challenging time. This has been a commitment I have seen from employees throughout the University, and I am so grateful that you continue to bring that commitment to Suffolk--even from a distance.</p>
<p>Wishing you all good health,</p>

                                <p>Dear Students,</p>
<p>First, let me start by saying how incredibly appreciative the University is for your flexibility and patience during this very difficult <a rel="noopener noreferrer" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-nCoV/index.html" target="_blank">COVID-19</a> situation. Most students moved out of the residence halls over the weekend and will continue to do so through Tuesday, March 17. This message provides updates and important information for students.</p>
<h4>Suffolk Updates</h4>
<p>The University is regularly updating this&nbsp;Coronavirus Advisory web page with information on the steps we are taking to respond to the evolving situation, always with the health and safety of our students, employees and the wider community as our highest priority. Please continue to check the site for updates. Frequently Asked Questions will be available on this page shortly.</p>
<h4>Medical and&nbsp;Counseling&nbsp;Assistance</h4>
<h5>Medical Appointments</h5>
<p>Due to COVID-19 health concerns, students must be pre-screened via a phone medical appointment by a Counseling, Health and Wellness (CHW) nurse practitioner in order&nbsp;to determine if it is safe/appropriate&nbsp;to proceed with&nbsp;an in-person&nbsp;medical office visit. This phone appointment must be scheduled on the student portal. See below. Students assessed by phone and determined as safe/appropriate for a medical office visit will be scheduled for an office visit, same-day if possible. Those students for whom it is determined that an in-person medical office visit is not safe/appropriate, will be provided medical triage, advice, and referrals specific to each individual student's need.</p>
<p>You can schedule a same-day phone appointment with a CHW nurse practitioner each business day via the <a rel="noopener noreferrer" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://studenthealthportal.suffolk.edu" target="_blank">student health portal</a>. Use your existing Suffolk email login and password. You are responsible for forwarding a phone number at which you will be available for a nurse practitioner to call during your phone appointment time by following the instructions provided on the student health portal.</p>
<h5>Counseling Appointments</h5>
<p><a href="/student-life/health-wellness/counseling-center">CHW Counseling Services</a> remains open for all face-to-face services in CHW offices. In addition, CHW Counseling clinicians can provide telehealth services using confidential Zoom technology for students who currently reside in Massachusetts including initial crisis consultations, short-term individual counseling, follow-up visits with the CHW psychiatric nurse practitioner or referrals. If you will be residing outside of Massachusetts during the remainder of the spring 2020 semester, CHW can assist you with mental health referrals. Please note: CHW Counseling providers are licensed in Massachusetts and can only provide services within the state. Please call 617-573-8226 to schedule an appointment or to receive more information. To access mental health support after hours or on the weekend, call 617-573-8226 and follow the prompts.</p>

<p>Inquiries regarding technical matters related to remote learning should be sent to the Service Desk.

<p>You may leave your belonging on campus and pick them up at a later date to be determined. If you have not informed us you will be choosing this option, please <a href="mailto:reslife@suffolk.edu">email Residence Life</a>&nbsp;and fill out the form to store your belongings in your current room. You will not be able to store these items past May 6, 2020.</p>
<h5>Express Check-out Envelopes</h5>
<p>There will be Express Check-Out envelopes located on the first floors of each residence hall.

This will officially check you out of the building.</p>
<h5>Rental Cars</h5>

<h4>Residence Students Approved to Stay on Campus</h4>
<p>If you have been approved to stay on-campus, you may continue to do so. This is especially important for our international students and students with special circumstances. However, other students are urged to reconsider your plans and move home, if possible.</p>
<p>If you are staying because you work in Boston (especially in restaurants and bars), it is likely your hours have been reduced or discontinued. If your Boston employment ends and you will lose your off-campus job salary, it may be to your advantage to move home and receive the prorated housing refund and remaining meal plan refund.</p>
<p>Prorated housing refunds are effective starting March 18. No prorated refunds will be approved for students who move out after April 10, 2020. Prorated housing refunds for students who move out by March 17, 2020 will be:</p>

We will be providing more information to you by the end of this week, Friday, March 20. For this week, please submit the hours you have worked either on-campus or remotely, with supervisor approval.</p>

                                <p>Dear Students:</p>
<p>We appreciate all of your patience, understanding and flexibility during this unprecedented move-out and transition experience.&nbsp; We understand this is a stressful time for all.&nbsp; During this move-out weekend, here are some additional resources and points to consider as you complete your move-out from your residence hall room.</p>
<h4>Street Parking</h4>
<p>There will be very limited parking in the front of your residence hall, and both SUPD as well as Boston Police Department will be assisting in traffic control.&nbsp; We ask you to not park your car in front when you arrive, but first pack up your room, and when you are ready to move out, move the car in front of the building to expedite the transition process.&nbsp; We will have many people trying to move-out during very short time periods, so we appreciate all of your patience during this process.</p>
<h4>Storage Options</h4>
<p>Our official storage provider,&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer" rel="noopener noreferrer" track="on" shape="rect" href="https://www.dormroommovers.com/storage-shipping-services-at-Suffolk-University-Boston-MA?utm_campaign=20spring&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=Suffolk+University&amp;utm_term=Suffolk+University&amp;utm_content=web_newsletter&amp;src=20partner-web_newsletter" linktype="1" target="_blank">Dorm Room Movers</a>&nbsp;is here to help you with your move-out during the recent changes in the academic schedule.

<h4>Elevator Access</h4>
<p>Upon your arrival and during move-out, please try to avoid cramming into an elevator to go up to your room.&nbsp; We ask that you take a little extra time and create proper amounts of distance (3 feet away from each other) to keep everyone safe during this move-out process.</p>
<h4>Things to Bring When Coming to Campus</h4>
<p>If possible bring hand sanitizer, sanitizing wipes, and extra cleaning supplies with you to move out.&nbsp; Our maintenance and custodial staff has increased the cleaning and sanitizing of our residence halls, but please take caution when using our communal items throughout the moving process.</p>
<h4>Express Check-Out Envelopes</h4>
<p>There will be Express Check-Out envelopes located on the first floors of each residence hall.&nbsp; When you are ready to leave, simply fill in the information on the front of the envelopes, drop your key(s) in the envelope, seal the envelope, and drop it into the drop off box.&nbsp; This will officially check you out of the building.</p>
<p>This weekend's check-out process requires slightly more time, and we thank you for your flexibility throughout this process.&nbsp; Please call&nbsp;<strong>617-305-2500 x0&nbsp;</strong>if you need anything throughout the weekend.</p>

                            <div class="panel-body">
                                <p>Dear Suffolk Student:</p>
<p>Given the unprecedented situation with COVID-19, as you were informed yesterday, face-to-face courses will be moved to remote instruction starting next Wednesday, March 18. No classes will be held on Monday, March 16 and Tuesday, March 17. Normal residence hall operations will cease on March 18. However, we understand there are students who may have special circumstances that could necessitate staying in a residence hall, and we are committed to doing our best to meet those needs in light of the current public health challenge. We have set up a petition process so that we can consider those circumstances on a case by case basis.</p>
<h4>Visiting the Campus</h4>
<p>The Suffolk University campus remains open and operational. Although students will be attending virtual classes, the campus is staffed and open for services. The libraries and student service departments are open on a normal schedule for in-person and virtual meetings with students. Whenever possible, we are providing services in person and also virtually so that no matter where a student resides, assistance is available.</p>
<h4>Campus Activities</h4>
<p>We realize that the co-curricular aspects of student life are critical to your development and we encourage you to maintain social media connections with each other during this time.Student organization meetings and other campus events may be suspended until further notice. Please check with your student leaders and others to determine if an event will be held as scheduled.</p>
<h4>If You Need Medical Care</h4>
<p>As communicated in previous COVID-19 Suffolk health advisories, you should consult with a medical provider:</p>
<ul>
    <li> If you develop symptoms of a fever AND a cough OR shortness of breath AND you have recently traveled in China, Iran, Italy, OR South Korea OR</li>
    <li> If you have had exposure to a person diagnosed with COVID-19 OR</li>
    <li> If you have had exposure to a person who is being evaluated for COVID-19.</li>
</ul>
<p>You may call <a href="/student-life/health-wellness">Counseling, Health and Wellness</a>&nbsp;(CHW) at 617-573-8260 during business hours or your medical provider at home. Do not go to the offices before calling and speaking with someone. After business hours, please call the Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) Emergency Department at 617-724-4100 or your local hospital emergency room.</p>
<h4>Refunds</h4>
<p>Because students will be receiving academic credit and grades for virtual classes and will have access to support and guidance from both faculty and staff, no refunds of tuition will be made.</p>
<p>Prorated housing refunds for the remainder of the semester will be issued to residence students who have not been granted an exception to stay in residence. Also, refunds will be issued to residence students who have balances on their meal plans.</p>
<p>Refunds will be issued as follows:</p>
<ul>
    <li>If the student currently has an outstanding balance on their student account they will receive a credit to their student account in the amount of the refund. In the event that the refund is in excess of the outstanding balance, the student will receive the remaining amount via direct deposit or check mailed to their address on file.</li>
    <li>If the student is signed up to pay Suffolk using a monthly payment plan, the payment plan balance will be reduced by the amount of the credit due to the student. In the event the credit is in excess of the payment plan balance, the student will receive the remaining amount via direct deposit or check mailed to their address on file.</li>
    <li>All students that don't fall in the two above scenarios will receive their full refund via direct deposit or check mailed to their address on file.</li>
</ul>
<p>We are talking with the MBTA regarding the possibility of commuter pass refunds and will communicate with students who have MBTA commuter passes once any decisions about refunds have been made.</p>
<h4>Work-Study and Student Employment</h4>
<p>Information for work-study students and students who work on-campus will be sent to your Suffolk email address from Student Financial Services. Stay tuned.</p>
<h4>Attendance &amp; Absences</h4>
<p>Given the unprecedented situation with COVID-19, faculty will use a variety of methods to convey course material remotely. Instructors will communicate directly with you about this.</p>
<p>You are expected to log in (if appropriate) and stay current with your coursework at the direction of your faculty. While faculty will be asked to accommodate individual situations, the existing <a href="/student-life/student-services/student-handbook/university-policies-for-students-cas-sbs/attendance-absences">Attendance and Absence Policy</a>&nbsp;will remain in place. If you become ill, you should directly communicate with your faculty to request an excused absence. Consider keeping copies of all emails you send to faculty as well as work submitted.</p>
<p>So the University can monitor illness among students in virtual classes, you are strongly encouraged to submit an <a rel="noopener noreferrer" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://suffolk.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_50i2obYkhy2yTgp" target="_blank">Absence Notification Form</a>. Upon receipt of your absence notification form, the Student Affairs Office will inform faculty of the date(s) of your absence(s). Completion of this form will not take the place of your directly communicating with your faculty about how you can be successful in class.</p>
<h4>Continuity of Learning</h4>
<p>In order to be fully prepared for continuity of learning, we ask you to practice using the tools and resources that you will rely on in an alternative learning environment. Here are some suggestions that we highly recommend:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Ensure that you have WIFI internet access at home.</li>
    <li>Be prepared to virtually "attend" classes and student services appointments online via Blackboard and Zoom, respectively.</li>
    <li>Review the technology tools (Blackboard, MySuffolk, Suffolk email) on <a href="/about/directory/information-technology-services/students">our resources page</a>.</li>
    <li>Practice using your technology tools.&nbsp;It is always easier to become familiar with tools in advance when you have more time to review the material.</li>
</ul>
<p>We are also aware that some students may not have a personal computer or access to online resources at home. A limited number of computers are available for use in the Sawyer Library. We are currently exploring alternative methods of access, including the use of mobile devices (Zoom and Blackboard), which may be used on a mobile device and we will communicate those to you.</p>
<h4>Update Your Emergency Contact Information</h4>
<p>Please update your emergency contact information via <a href="/student-life/student-services/student-affairs/e-checkin">E-checkin</a>&nbsp;so the University may contact you in the event of a school closure or other emergency. Visit&nbsp;the E-checkin page&nbsp;for directions about updating your information.</p>
<h4>Accessing Suffolk Services &amp; Personal Support</h4>
<p>The University will remain open and operational, and the work of educating our students will move forward uninterrupted. Services for students such as <a href="/student-life/health-wellness">Counseling, Health and Wellness</a>, <a href="/student-life/student-services/student-affairs/suffolk-cares">Suffolk CARES</a>&nbsp;and the <a href="/academics/advising-student-services/academic-success-services">Center for Learning and Academic Success</a>&nbsp;will remain available. Simply contact the office (a list of which can be found in <a href="/about/directory">our campus directory</a>) by telephone or email for assistance.</p>
<h4>Advising and Registration for the Fall 2020 Semester</h4>
<p>Fall 2020 advising and on-line registration will be held as scheduled for undergraduate and graduate and students.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Undergraduate and graduate course search and pre-registration schedule building will begin March 16.</li>
    <li>The <a href="/about/directory/registrars-office">Registrar</a>, <a href="/academics/advising-student-services/undergraduate-academic-advising-center">Undergraduate Advising Center</a>, undergraduate and graduate academic deans, and academic department chairs are developing a mixture of online advising opportunities which will be communicated to you. Specific information will be emailed to all students by March 16.</li>
    <li>Online registration begins for CAS and SBS students on April 6.</li>
</ul>
<p>Check your Suffolk email regularly for updates regarding registration and academic advising.</p>
<h4>International Students</h4>
<p>International students registered for 12 credits or more are permitted to remain Suffolk students and stay in the U.S. even while taking virtual courses. Any questions should be directed to <a href="/admission/international-students">International Student Services</a>&nbsp;at 617-573-8034 or <a rel="noopener noreferrer" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="mailto:isso@suffolk.edu" target="_blank">by email</a>.</p>
<h4>Residence Students</h4>
<p>Current international residence students may continue stay on campus for the remainder of the spring semester. Current resident students with special circumstances and those who are unable to move their belongings out of the residence halls by March 17 may petition to remain on campus/leave belongings on campus until later in the semester by completing the <a rel="noopener noreferrer" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://suffolk.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_dmc9nK8QzqZct25" target="_blank">Petition Form</a>. Petitions will be reviewed and approved on a case by case basis. Students are encouraged to take all belongings with them, but we understand some students may not be able to return to campus to do so at this time.</p>
<p>So that we can properly assist students in moving out, we ask that you adhere to the following schedule for move out. However, if there are special circumstances that prohibit you from moving out as scheduled, please <a rel="noopener noreferrer" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="mailto:reslife@suffolk.edu" target="_blank">email us</a> to make other arrangements.</p>

                                <p>Dear Members of the Suffolk Community,</p>
<p>This University, like others, has had to respond to the rapidly evolving global coronavirus pandemic with enormous speed, and the pace of change has no doubt been dizzying. I want to pause to thank our entire community for your flexibility and willingness to adapt to what is truly an extraordinary situation. The health and safety of all of the members of our community, their loved ones, and the wider public, remains our greatest concern, even as we work across the University to ensure that we keep our educational commitments to our students with the least amount of disruption possible.</p>
<p>Following President Kelly's message yesterday announcing that we will move to virtual instruction as of Wednesday, March 18, this message consolidates important information and decisions the University has made pertaining to issues that affect both students and employees.</p>
<h4>The Boston Campus</h4>
<p>The Suffolk University Boston campus remains open and operational. Although students will be attending virtual classes, the campus is staffed and open for services. The libraries and student service departments are open on a normal schedule for in-person and virtual meetings with students. Student services will continue on campus and, when feasible, virtually, so that students living at a distance can continue to take advantage of those services. As a reminder,&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://sites.suffolk.edu/ctse/continuity-of-learning/">faculty resources</a>&nbsp;for online teaching are available through the Center for Teaching &amp; Scholarly Excellence. Resources for students are available within <a rel="noopener noreferrer" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://suffolku.blackboard.com/webapps/portal/execute/tabs/tabAction?tab_tab_group_id=_121_1" target="_blank">Blackboard</a>.</p>
<h4>The Madrid Campus</h4>
<p>In recent days the Madrid regional authorities have closed all schools in Madrid in an effort to contain the COVID-19 outbreak. We made the difficult decision to strongly recommend that all of our students on the Madrid campus return to their homes. They will be able to complete their classes online. The staff in Madrid and Boston have worked to arrange transportation for the students, and the first flights back landed earlier today. We understand how profoundly disappointing this disruption is for our students and the staff in Madrid, who form a close-knit community, and we hope that the conditions in Madrid begin to stabilize and improve.</p>
<h4>Residence Halls</h4>
<p>Students are being asked to move out of residence halls by Tuesday, March 17, and the Office of Residence Life &amp; Housing is working with students to facilitate moves. Vice President for Student Affairs and Dean of Students Ann Coyne is communicating the many details to residential students. The University will provide prorated refunds for housing charges and refunds for balances on meal plans. We understand there are students, including international students, who may have special circumstances that could necessitate staying in a campus residence hall, and we have set up a petition process so that we can consider those needs on a case-by-case basis.</p>
<h4>University Travel</h4>
<p>University travel policies have been temporarily updated to prohibit University-sponsored international travel and to address domestic travel. Please read these important updates pertaining to both University-sponsored and personal travel on this page.</p>
<h4>Meetings and Events</h4>
<p>We are instituting restrictions on Suffolk-sponsored meetings and events, both on our campus and off-campus. This includes the required cancelation of all Suffolk-sponsored group events that bring visitors to our campus, Suffolk-sponsored off-campus group events, and prohibition of in-person internal meetings that exceed 25 participants. Please see the Events and Meeting Policy on this page for greater detail. These restrictions will be reviewed as the situation develops and may be lifted. No decision has been made about 2020 Commencement exercises.</p>
<p>Separate guidance will be issued with regard to employees. Although the campus remains open, we urge all employees to avail themselves of the online training available to prepare for the possibility of needing to work remotely.</p>
<p>We understand that you have many questions, and we are working to address as many of them as possible. Our Call Center is doing a phenomenal job of responding to callers and gathering information about additional topics that we need to address. We will continue to update the community as the situation evolves. We appreciate the significant demands that this extraordinary situation has placed on everyone in the Suffolk community. Thank you for your flexibility, adaptability, and for treating each other with kindness.</p>
<p>Take care,</p>
<p>Julie Sandell<br />

                                <h4>University Moves to Virtual Instruction</h4>
<p>Dear Members of the Suffolk Community,</p>
<p>Suffolk University is taking all necessary steps to protect the health and safety of our students and our University community in the face of the global spread of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19). While there have been no reported cases of COVID-19 at Suffolk, we are focused on minimizing the health risks to our students, our employees and the broader community. That has and continues to be our foremost guiding principle. There is a great deal of work going on across the University to ensure that we are prepared to meet the challenges of this rapidly evolving public health emergency. I write today to update you on a major change in how we will conduct our classes for the remainder of the semester.</p>
<ul>
    <li>The University is extending spring break by two additional days. When classes resume Wednesday, March 18, instruction will be delivered virtually through online classes and/or other forms of remote learning for the remainder of the semester. In the coming days students will receive specific instructions from faculty members, all designed to ensure continuity of learning and that they can complete their courses this semester.</li>
    <li>The Suffolk campus will remain open and operational, and the work of educating our students will move forward uninterrupted.  Services for students such as Counseling, Health &amp; Wellness and Academic Advising will remain available. </li>
    <li>However, to minimize health risks to our community, we ask that students who are currently living in University-sponsored housing make plans to move out of their rooms, with the exception of international students living on campus who are unable to return to their home countries and domestic students with special circumstances. Students who move out of the residence halls will be eligible for a pro-rated refund based on the time remaining in the semester.</li>
    <li>A communication for residential students from the Office of Residence Life &amp; Housing with further details will be forthcoming. It will include answers to frequently asked questions, move-out schedule requirements, timing, and details of a petition process for those students seeking to stay in campus housing because of unique circumstances.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is a major decision for the University, and it was not made lightly. Close, in-person collaboration between students, faculty, and staff is something we value greatly as a hallmark of the education that we provide at Suffolk. However, we have carefully monitored guidance from public health agencies, and in the current environment health risks would be heightened by large numbers of students returning from spring break travels to gather in classrooms and residence halls. We also understand that there are members of our community who are more vulnerable to the health risks of virus, and these steps may help protect their health and well-being.</p>
<p>A cross-section of University leadership has been meeting each business day and is working across the institution to respond to the situation as it evolves and to ensure that we are prepared, including with our remote instruction capabilities. We also are looking carefully at plans for any upcoming events and activities, and we will communicate decisions as they are made.</p>
<p>We understand that students and families will have questions. Starting at 10 a.m. tomorrow (Wednesday, March 11), the University will operate an information hotline, and those who have questions may dial 833-761-0115. The hotline will be staffed from 10 a.m. to 7 p.m. Monday through Friday and from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. Saturday and Sunday.</p>
<p>I thank our students for their patience and willingness to adapt to changing circumstances in this challenging environment. And I am grateful for the exceptional dedication of our faculty and staff, who are working tirelessly to ensure that teaching and learning at Suffolk University continue uninterrupted.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Marisa J. Kelly<br />
President</p>

                                <p><em>Message Date: March 5, 2020</em></p>
<p>Dear Suffolk Students:</p>
<p>The University continues to closely monitor developments in the global spread of coronavirus (COVID-19) and related public health recommendations and guidelines. As we prepare for spring break next week, please be reminded of the following.</p>
<h4>Prevention &amp; Education</h4>
<p>We encourage you to view information from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and learn about the&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/about/symptoms.html" target="_blank">signs and symptoms of COVID-19</a>&nbsp;as well as&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/about/prevention-treatment.html" target="_blank">prevention steps to help keep you healthy</a>.</p>
<h4>Personal Spring Break Travel</h4>
<p>The CDC and Massachusetts Governor Charlie Baker have recommended institutions of higher education cancel outgoing international travel programs. Suffolk has cancelled spring break international travel seminars and will review CDC recommendations for additional cancellations on a continual basis.</p>
<p>We urge students with personal plans to travel abroad over spring break to strongly consider staying in the U.S. If you are an international student and live on campus, you are permitted to stay in your residence hall room over break at no additional charge. Please contact&nbsp;<a href="mailto:mmcgrath6@suffolk.edu">Matt McGrath</a>&nbsp;immediately to discuss this option.</p>
<p>It is important that you stay abreast of&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/index.html" target="_blank">all travel advisories from the CDC</a>, which can change daily.&nbsp;Plan on extra time for travel and stay up to date on developments regarding both U.S. and international destinations. As a precaution, consider purchasing travel insurance through your airline, if available. The CDC has also produced&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/faqs.html" target="_blank">frequently asked travel questions</a>. Please be aware that the CDC is stating that travelers to high risk countries will be asked to&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/after-travel-precautions.html" target="_blank">self-quarantine for 14 days after returning to the U.S.</a></p>
<h4>Emergency Contact Information</h4>
<p>Please update your emergency contact information via E-checkin so the University may contact you in the event of a school closure or other emergency. Visit&nbsp;<a href="/student-life/student-services/student-affairs/e-checkin">the E-checkin page</a>&nbsp;for directions about updating your information.</p>
<h4>Returning from Spring Break</h4>
<h5>Attendance and Continuity of Student Learning</h5>
<p>Over spring break, you will receive information via your Suffolk email address&nbsp;about temporary changes to the University's Attendance Policy. The email will also update you as to how the University will deliver academic content to students should the CDC and/or local authorities recommend school closures. Suffolk has no information suggesting such a recommendation will occur but the university wishes to be proactive in planning.</p>
<h5>Residence Hall Students</h5>
<p>Check to make sure you have at least a 14-day supply of your prescription medications, and have other health supplies on hand, including pain relievers, stomach remedies, cough and cold medicines, fluids with electrolytes and vitamins. We encourage you to bring cleaning supplies and disinfectants for your personal use. This is especially important if you live in a suite/apartment where you will be cleaning your shared restroom. Our facilities staff has increased its cleaning and sanitizing of common use areas.</p>
<h4>If You Need Medical Assistance</h4>
<p>As communicated in previous COVID-19 Suffolk health advisories, which can be viewed on this page, should you develop symptoms of a fever and a cough or shortness of breath and you have recently traveled in China, Iran, Italy, or South Korea OR you have had exposure to a person diagnosed with COVID-19 OR who is being evaluated for COVID-19:</p>
<ul>
    <li>On campus: please call CHW Health at 617-573-8260 to speak with a medical provider.</li>
    <li>At home or when traveling: please call your home medical provider or a local hospital emergency room to discuss your symptoms and follow their guidance.</li>
</ul>
<p>We hope you have a restful and healthy spring break and we look forward to welcoming you back to campus shortly.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Ann E. Coyne, Ed. D.<br />
Vice President for Student Affairs</p>

                                <p>Dear Members of the Suffolk Community,</p>
<p>The University continues to closely monitor developments in the global spread of coronavirus (COVID-19) and related public health recommendations and guidelines.</p>
<p>Based on the latest guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the U.S. Department of State, and international public health organizations, the University has made the difficult decision to cancel&nbsp;all outgoing University-sponsored international student travel until further notice, including international spring break travel programs.&nbsp;Students who were scheduled to travel on a Suffolk international program have been notified of the cancellations, and we will work with students and their faculty to minimize the academic and financial impact.</p>
<p>Following elevated U.S. travel warnings for Italy and South Korea,&nbsp;the University has strongly recommended that all of our students in those two countries return to the United States as soon as possible. The University is requiring that students and employees returning from countries with CDC "level 3" travel designations -- including South Korea and Italy -- stay home and monitor themselves for any potential signs of infection for a 14-day incubation period. People who self-quarantine have no symptoms, but monitor themselves for fever, cough, and breathing difficulties.&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Other study abroad programs including Madrid</h4>
<p>At this time, we have not recommended that all students who are currently studying in other countries, including at our Madrid campus in Spain, return to the United States. We are, however, closely monitoring what is a very fluid situation, and we will reassess that decision on a daily basis. We are supporting students who choose to return and will help them manage the academic and financial impact of their change in plans as well.</p>
<p>Again, there have been no reported cases of COVID-19 within the Suffolk community. The safety of our students and employees remains our highest priority, and the University continues to take steps to prepare for any needed response.&nbsp;At my request, Provost Sandell has convened a task force (a subset of the&nbsp;University's&nbsp;Incident Support Team), which&nbsp;has been&nbsp;charged with&nbsp;overseeing the University's response to the ongoing and ever-changing COVID-19&nbsp;outbreak. This group of senior leaders and administrators will&nbsp;meet&nbsp;every day for the foreseeable future&nbsp;and&nbsp;will constantly monitor&nbsp;and assess&nbsp;the threat&nbsp;that&nbsp;the&nbsp;virus&nbsp;presents to&nbsp;all&nbsp;members of our community, both here in Boston and around the world.&nbsp;The University will continue to communicate closely with members of our community and will provide updates.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Marisa Kelly<br />
President</p>

                                <p>To all faculty and staff:</p>
<p>Through continuous efforts, most of the Suffolk University community has developed the capacity to participate in&nbsp;<a href="/-/media/suffolk/documents/about/mission-and-history/policies-and-procedures/continuity-of-learning-policy.pdf?la=en&amp;hash=FDF0E6061F3E6B31FADA77C5E413A188F5DA89E4" target="_blank">continuity of learning for students [PDF]</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="/about/directory/risk-management/suffolk-ready-business-continuity-planning">business continuity</a>&nbsp;during short term disruptions caused by weather, or when we need to close the campus because of a public event in Boston. However, we need to continue to strengthen our ability to operate in the possible event of a longer-term disruption of our face-to-face activities. The University continues to follow guidance and recommendations from the Boston Public Health Commission and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) with regard to domestic and international activities in light of the worldwide spread of the COVID-19 coronavirus. As you have seen in the news, the situation is very fluid. A group of the Suffolk University leadership is meeting daily to assess operations in Boston and Madrid, develop resources, and plan communications with all members of our community. Universities around the world have experienced disruptions and we need to be prepared, should that be necessary at Suffolk.</p>
<p>Simply put, for faculty, we need plans in place to continue teaching as many students, in as many courses as possible, in a situation when teaching on campus is not possible. For staff, we need to be able to provide services to students remotely, and we also need to be able to continue core business operations if we need to work from home.</p>
<p>We have many tools already available to assist in developing and implementing continuity plans. Tim Albers, in Risk Management, as well as Linda Bruenjes and Jenene Cook, both in the Center for Teaching and Scholarly Excellence (CTSE), are ready to assist individual departments in developing continuity plans.</p>
<p>The academic deans have worked with department chairs and faculty to identify gaps in knowledge about remote teaching tools, so that Linda and her team can provide targeted training. Most faculty already use&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://suffolku.blackboard.com/" target="_blank">Blackboard</a>, which has embedded tools for virtual classes and class participation, including&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://suffolk.screenstepslive.com/s/1050/m/83820/l/1005257-how-to-access-zoom-from-within-blackboard" target="_blank" data-auth="NotApplicable">Zoom</a>. The CTSE has a&nbsp;<a href="/academics/research-at-suffolk/center-for-teaching-scholarly-excellence/resources/technology-innovation-in-learning-teaching-tilt">wide variety of instructions and tutorials</a>, already available online, to help faculty and others get started with these tools, and they are ready and willing to develop additional resources to meet departmental needs.</p>
<p>For many departments and employees, remote work can be an effective tool when managing a disruption. To ensure preparedness, managers can request access for their staff and practice using off-campus tools such as VPN, Zoom and Office365 in a remote work setting now. Additional business continuity action steps can be found&nbsp;<a href="/-/media/suffolk/documents/about/directory/risk-management/suffolk_university_guide_to_business_continuity_planning_pdftxt.pdf?la=en&amp;hash=509CDA88D44EAE8108BCB71425EEB43147439A16" target="_blank">in this document [PDF]</a>.</p>
<p>All employees should visit the&nbsp;<a href="/about/directory/information-technology-services/support/off-campus-tools">Off-Campus Tools</a>&nbsp;page and faculty can visit the&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://sites.suffolk.edu/ctse/continuity-of-learning/" target="_blank">Continuity of Learning</a>&nbsp;page for more tools and resources. In addition to these tools, a live interactive&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://suffolk.zoom.us/j/329173550" target="_blank">webinar</a>&nbsp;on the use of Zoom will be offered on Friday, March 6 at 10:30 a.m.  This will be relevant for both staff and faculty, and will be recorded for later viewing if you can&rsquo;t tune in to the webinar.</p>
<p>Drop-in sessions to assist faculty and staff in learning about remote work readiness are scheduled for:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Wednesday, March 4<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;from 2:00 &ndash; 3:00 p.m. in Sargent 655G</li>
    <li>Thursday, March 5<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;from 3:00&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;5:30 p.m. in the 1<sup>st</sup>&nbsp;Floor Amenities Room, 73 Tremont</li>
    <li>Friday, March 6<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;from 1:00&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;3:30 p.m. in the 1<sup>st</sup>&nbsp;Floor Amenities Room, 73 Tremont</li>
</ul>
<p>During these sessions we can help you evaluate your readiness needs and connect to further training and resources. Additionally, all employees are encouraged to test their tech tools on Friday, March 6<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;from 9:00&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;10:30 a.m. ITS Service Desk technicians will be available at 617-557-2000 or&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="mailto:servicedesk@suffolk.edu" target="_blank">by email</a>&nbsp;to answer your questions.</p>
<p>Although we don&rsquo;t know when we might need to use these tools, we do know that preparing before we need them is less stressful than trying to use them for the first time during a business disruption. If you have not already done so, please start to make a plan for how you could continue your work, no matter what that is, if it was not possible to come to campus for an extended period of time.&nbsp; Managers will be reaching out to staff members and deans will be working with their faculty to refine the plans and to develop creative alternatives for activities that simply cannot be accomplished or managed remotely. Please let them know what additional resources you might need, so that we can coordinate our efforts.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

                                <p>Dear Members of the Suffolk Community,</p>
<p>As of Feb. 26, the spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) within the United States continues to be rated low by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). CDC officials are encouraging U.S. communities to proactively prepare to address a potential increase of U.S. coronavirus cases and the international spread of COVID-19 has impacted CDC international travel advisories.</p>
<p>While there have been no reported cases of coronavirus within the Suffolk community, the University continues to follow guidance and recommendations from the Boston Public Health Commission and the CDC. We are monitoring developments closely, including at our Madrid campus and all other international locations in which we have students studying abroad, and communicating regularly with our community. The health and safety of our students and community members is our highest priority, and the University is proactively taking steps to support our students and employees, maximize prevention, minimize risk, and ensure that we are prepared to respond as the situation develops.</p>
<p>With possible travel occurring for Suffolk community members over the spring break and with COVID-19 preparation being emphasized, the update below is being disseminated to the Suffolk community to address the following:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Current COVID-19-related travel advisories by the CDC and travel resources for Suffolk community members</li>
    <li>Spring break housing information for current Suffolk residence hall students from countries on the CDC watch level 1 (Hong Kong), alert level 2 (Iran, Italy, Japan) and warning level 3 (China, South Korea, Venezuela)</li>
    <li>Reminders regarding COVID-19 prevention steps</li>
    <li>Guidance should you become ill with symptoms of concern</li>
    <li>Preparation steps at Suffolk University</li>
</ul>
<h4>Travel</h4>
<p>CDC levels of traveler alerts for specific countries warranting COVID-19 health risk ratings are listed below.</p>
<h5>Level 1, Watch Level, Practice Usual Precautions - Hong Kong</h5>
<p>With risk at level 1, the CDC currently does not recommend canceling or postponing travel. For those who travel to Hong Kong, the CDC advises these travelers to follow the prevention steps listed below in this letter.</p>
<h5>Level 2, Alert Level, Practice Enhanced Precautions - Iran, Italy, Japan</h5>
<p>With risk at level 2, the CDC currently recommends that older adults and those with chronic medical conditions should consider postponing nonessential travel to Iran, Italy, and Japan. For those who travel to these countries, the CDC advises these travelers to follow the prevention steps listed below in this letter.</p>
<h5>Level 3, Warning Level - China, South Korea, Venezuela</h5>
<p>The CDC recommends&nbsp;avoiding non-essential travel&nbsp;to China, South Korea, and Venezuela. The CDC's level 3 recommendation for China does NOT include Hong Kong, Macau, or the Island of Taiwan. The CDC's level 3 recommendation for Venezuela is based upon "outbreaks of infectious diseases" occurring in Venezuela and the CDC's assessment that "adequate health care is currently not available in most of the country."</p>
<p>The U.S. government is continuing suspended entry of foreign nationals who have been in China within the past 14 days.</p>
<p>At this time, American citizens, lawful permanent residents, and family (as specified in the Presidential Proclamation) who have been in China in the past 14 days are allowed to enter the United States. These travelers are being directed to specific U.S. airports and at those locations these individuals are being screened and instructed to self-quarantine for 14 days.</p>
<h5>Additional Travel Information for Students</h5>
<p>Suffolk has cancelled spring 2020 study abroad trips to China as well as a travel seminar that was scheduled for Italy during spring break. The Center for International Programs and Services is working closely with impacted students to identify other opportunities.</p>
<h5>Spring Break Housing for Current Residence Hall Students from Countries on the CDC COVID-19 Watch, Alert, or Warning Lists</h5>
<p>If you are a current residence hall student from any of the countries of concern listed on the <a rel="noopener noreferrer" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/index.html" target="_blank">CDC travel alert</a> (see&nbsp;<strong></strong>for updated information), you will be provided the option of remaining in the residence hall at no cost over spring break. Please <a href="mailto:mmmcgrath6@suffolk.edu">email Matthew McGrath</a> in the Office of Residence Life, 73 Tremont Street, 7th floor at&nbsp;to request to register for this option.</p>
<h4>Important Prevention Reminder</h4>
<p>The CDC and Boston Public Health Commission have recommended precautionary measures consistent with routine preventive measures for many types of virus transmissions, including common colds and influenza. They include:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Frequent hand-washing with soap and warm, running water for at least 20 seconds; if soap and &nbsp;water are not readily available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60 percent alcohol</li>
    <li>Coughing or sneezing into your sleeve</li>
    <li>Avoid touching your eyes, nose, or mouth</li>
    <li>Not sharing food, drink, or eating utensils</li>
    <li>No contact with bodily fluids of an ill person</li>
    <li>Staying hydrated</li>
    <li>Staying home when ill until fever-free for 24 hours</li>
</ul>
<h4>Important Reminder - Seeking Medical Care</h4>
<p>Suffolk has recommended individuals follow <a rel="noopener noreferrer" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/about/steps-when-sick.html" target="_blank">CDC guidance</a> regarding when to seek medical care:</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><strong>AND WHO HAS EITHER</strong></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">traveled within China in the 14 days prior to symptom onset</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><strong>OR</strong></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">had close contact with someone who is sick and being evaluated for COVID-19 or who has received a laboratory confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis:&nbsp;</p>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
    <li>Students should call Counseling, Health and Wellness (CHW) at 617-573-8260 during business hours to consult with a CHW Nurse Practitioner.</li>
    <li>Employees should call their personal medical provider.</li>
    <li>MGH Emergency services may be contacted after-hours at 617-724-4100.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you are concerned about possible exposure to coronavirus, practice the precautionary measures above and seek consultation and instructions from a medical provider.</p>
<h4>Suffolk Preparation for COVID-19</h4>
<p>Suffolk University will continue to communicate closely with the Boston Public Health Commission and to consult CDC guidelines regarding COVID-19 and will continue to update the Suffolk community as needed. Again, while there have been no reported cases of COVID-19 within the Suffolk community, the University is actively taking steps to prepare for any needed response, with the safety of our students and employees as our highest priority. Those steps include preparing contingency plans to best ensure campus safety, continuity of learning, and business operations across the University.</p>

<h4>Questions about Face Masks</h4>
<p>Some have asked questions about the use of face masks.&nbsp; Public health officials in the United States including the CDC have not recommended the use of face masks by the general public who do not have active symptoms.&nbsp; Based on this guidance, CHW is not providing face masks to students unless medically necessary following an evaluation.</p>

<h4>Travel Information</h4>
<p>As of February 2, 2020, the CDC has recommended against all non-essential travel to China and the US Department of State has recommended avoiding all travel to China, a Level 4 warning.&nbsp; Students and employees considering personal travel to China are encouraged to monitor these advisories closely.</p>
<p>Starting February 2, 2020, increased restrictions on entry to the US were implemented by the <a rel="noopener noreferrer" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.dhs.gov/news/2020/02/02/dhs-issues-supplemental-instructions-inbound-flights-individuals-who-have-been-china" target="_blank">Department of Homeland Security</a>, limiting airport entry points from China and requiring mandatory screening and possible restricted movement or monitoring for those travelers who have been in China 14 days prior to arriving in the United States.&nbsp; These restrictions are subject to change anytime and community members are encouraged to closely monitor travel advisories and restrictions.</p>
<p>Suffolk is aware these changes may cause anxiety or distress among those most impacted by restricted travel.&nbsp; Support for students is available through Counseling, Health &amp; Wellness and other offices.&nbsp; Employees are encouraged to utilize EAP resources for support.</p>
<h5>Additional Travel Information for Students</h5>
<p>Suffolk's study abroad partners have cancelled spring 2020 study abroad trips to China and the Center for International Programs and Services is working closely with impacted students to identify other study abroad opportunities.

<p>Suffolk University has been closely monitoring developments regarding coronavirus.

While there are no reported cases of coronavirus within the Suffolk community and the risk to the public in Massachusetts and the U.S. remains low, we understand that this public health issue may be causing increased stress, and for some, concern for loved ones. Please know there are resources at Suffolk to support you. A listing of resources may be viewed&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer" track="on" href="https://www.suffolk.edu/student-life/health-wellness/coronavirus-health-advisory#collapse-Support-Resources-for-Employees">here</a>.</p>
<p>Suffolk University prides itself on fostering an environment of care and compassion and values our foundations of diversity and inclusion. We are fortunate to have a strong global community and it is important to support all members who comprise our community and particularly those from areas that are affected by the coronavirus at this time.</p>

However, for some members of our community, the wearing of masks is commonplace, and we remind the community to be respectful of individuals who choose to wear masks.</p>

<p>Suffolk University continues to closely monitor developments related to coronavirus.

<p>January 30, 2020</p>
<p>Suffolk University continues to actively monitor developments related to coronavirus. This communication follows an advisory sent to students last week and provides updated information.</p>
<p>Currently, there are no reported cases of coronavirus within the Suffolk community or in Massachusetts, and the&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html" target="_blank">Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)</a>&nbsp;reports the overall risk to members of the public in the United States remains low at this time. However, the&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019" target="_blank">World Health Organization (WHO)</a>&nbsp;declared the coronavirus outbreak a public health emergency. The virus was first discovered in Wuhan City, China and affects the respiratory system.</p>
<p>Suffolk is in close communication with the&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.bphc.org/whatwedo/infectious-diseases/Infectious-Diseases-A-to-Z/Pages/2019-Novel-Coronavirus.aspx" target="_blank">Boston Public Health Commission (BPHC)</a>, and, as with other communicable diseases, we have established protocols for responding to coronavirus. When treating students, University Counseling, Health and Wellness (CHW) providers are including screening questions related to recent travel in medical assessments as appropriate and are prepared to follow CDC and&nbsp;Boston Public Health Commission (BPHC)&nbsp;recommendations and instructions regarding prevention, identification and treatment of this virus.</p>
<p>Suffolk has advised students to follow CDC recommendations regarding when to seek medical consultation related to coronavirus. View the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.suffolk.edu/student-life/health-wellness/coronavirus-health-advisory#collapse-Suffolk-University-Community-Advisory-January-30-2020">January 23, 2020 Health Advisory to the Suffolk Community</a> or the CDC for specific instructions and virus transmission prevention steps.</p>
<p>Suffolk's study abroad partners have cancelled spring study abroad trips to China and the Center for International Programs and Services is working closely with impacted students to identify other study abroad opportunities. The University will consider if travel seminars to China scheduled for May 2020 will be offered, as planned.</p>
<p>The&nbsp;CDC recently advised individuals to avoid non-essential travel to China. The U. S. Department of State advised individuals to reconsider travel to China and against traveling to the Chinese province of Hubei. Travel advisories are evolving quickly and increased travel restrictions may be implemented. Students considering travel to China are encouraged to monitor these advisories closely.</p>
<p>We understand this is a concerning situation for students, many of whom have loved ones in China. Suffolk is supporting students and advises students to contact&nbsp;<a href="/student-life/student-services/student-affairs/suffolk-cares">Suffolk CARES</a>&nbsp;for further assistance. </p>
<p>CHW will continue to monitor CDC updates and guidance regarding the coronavirus and will communicate further information in conjunction with other campus administrators as needed.</p>

</ul>
<p>Suffolk University continues to actively monitor developments related to coronavirus. This communication follows an advisory sent to employees last week and provides updated information.</p>
<p>Currently, there are no reported cases of coronavirus within the Suffolk community or in Massachusetts, and the&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html" target="_blank">Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)</a>&nbsp;reports the overall risk to members of the public in the United States remains low at this time. However, the&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019" target="_blank">World Health Organization (WHO)</a>&nbsp;declared the coronavirus outbreak a public health emergency. The virus was first discovered in Wuhan City, China and affects the respiratory system.</p>
<p>Suffolk is in close communication with the&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.bphc.org/whatwedo/infectious-diseases/Infectious-Diseases-A-to-Z/Pages/2019-Novel-Coronavirus.aspx" target="_blank">Boston Public Health Commission (BPHC)</a>, and as with other communicable diseases, we have established protocols for responding to coronavirus. When treating students, University Counseling, Health and Wellness (CHW) providers are including screening questions related to recent travel in medical assessments as appropriate and are prepared to follow CDC and&nbsp;Boston Public Health Commission (BPHC)&nbsp;recommendations and instructions regarding prevention, identification and treatment of this virus.</p>
<p>Suffolk has advised employees to follow CDC recommendations regarding when to seek medical consultation related to coronavirus. View the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.suffolk.edu/student-life/health-wellness/coronavirus-health-advisory#collapse-Suffolk-University-Community-Advisory-January-30-2020">January 23, 2020 Health Advisory to the Suffolk Community</a> or the CDC for specific instructions and virus transmission prevention steps.</p>
<p>Suffolk's study abroad partners have cancelled spring study abroad trips to China and the Center for International Programs and Services is working closely with impacted students to identify other study abroad opportunities. The University will consider if travel seminars to China scheduled for May 2020 will be offered, as planned.</p>
<p>The Office of Risk Management (ORM) would like to remind all faculty and staff that according to the University's Travel Arrangements and Reimbursement Policy and Procedures, travelers may not travel to a country for which the United States Department of State has issued a Level 3 or Level 4 Travel Advisory without prior approval from the Office of Risk Management. At this time the <a rel="noopener noreferrer" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/traveladvisories/traveladvisories/china-travel-advisory.html" target="_blank">U. S. State Department</a>&nbsp;has raised its travel advisory for all of China to a Level 3: Reconsider Travel, and for Hubei Province to a Level 4: Do not travel.</p>
<p>ORM strongly encourages all faculty and staff to report their travel itinerary to our global travel assistance provider, Drum Cussac. Travelers can find out more about Drum Cussac and their services on the International Travel page of the website. Those with questions can <a rel="noopener noreferrer" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="mailto:riskmanagement@suffolk.edu" linktype="1" target="_blank">contact ORM</a>.</p>
<p>We understand this is a concerning situation for students, many of whom have loved ones in China. Suffolk is supporting students and advises students to contact&nbsp;<a href="/student-life/student-services/student-affairs/suffolk-cares">Suffolk CARES</a>&nbsp;for further assistance. </p>
<p>CHW will continue to monitor CDC updates and guidance regarding the coronavirus and will communicate further information in conjunction with other campus administrators as needed.</p>

<p>January 23, 2020</p>
<p>Dear Suffolk&nbsp; Community,</p>
<p>A new coronavirus (2019-nCoV) first identified in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, was reported in the U.S. in the state of Washington on January 21, 2020. The Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is closely monitoring the coronavirus which has led to hundreds becoming ill in China and to some deaths in China. The CDC and the Department of Homeland Security&rsquo;s Customs and Border Protection (CBP) are implementing enhanced health screenings to detect ill travelers traveling to the United States on direct or connecting flights from Wuhan, China. Based on current information, the risk from 2019-nCoV to the American public is currently deemed to be low. At this time, it is unclear how easily or sustainably this virus is spreading between people.</p>
<p>Anyone experiencing a fever and symptoms of respiratory illness (e.g., cough, difficulty breathing) AND who in the last 14 days before symptom onset traveled from Wuhan City, China OR who in the last 14 days had close contact with a sick patient with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV patient, should consult with a medical provider. Students can call CHW Health at 617-573-8260 to consult with a CHW Nurse Practitioner; employees should call their personal medical provider.</p>
<p>More CDC information about the coronavirus and travel related advisories can be found at:</p>
<p><a rel="noopener noreferrer" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html" target="_blank">https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html</a></p>

<p>Counseling, Health and Wellness will continue to monitor CDC updates and guidance regarding the coronavirus and will communicate with the Suffolk community as needed. CHW Health providers will also include travel questions in medical assessments as appropriate and will follow CDC recommendations regarding this virus.</p>
<p>As always, recommendations for prevention of virus transmission include:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Frequent hand-washing with soap and warm, running water for at least 20 seconds</li>
    <li>Coughing or sneezing into your sleeve</li>
    <li>Avoiding touching your eyes or nose</li>
    <li>Not sharing food, drink or eating utensils</li>
    <li>No contact with bodily fluids of an ill person</li>
    <li>Staying hydrated</li>
    <li>Staying home when ill until fever-free for 24 hours</li>
</ul>
<p>We wish you a healthy spring semester.</p>
