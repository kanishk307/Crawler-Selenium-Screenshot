<ul>
    <li>Create social distance/space between people of 6-10 feet when outside of your home (including when outdoors).</li>
    <li>Do not gather in groups and stay out of crowded places.</li>
    <li>Wear cloth face coverings (ie: multiple layers of fabric - not surgical masks or N95 masks) when outside of your home and especially when social distancing measures are difficult to maintain. &nbsp;It is important to launder the mask between uses.</li>
    <li>Wash your hands frequently with soap and warm, running water for at least 20 seconds; if soap and water are not readily available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol.</li>
    <li>Cough or sneeze into your elbow/sleeve.</li>
    <li>Avoid touching your eyes, nose, or mouth.</li>
    <li>Do not share food, drink, or eating utensils.</li>

                            <div class="panel-body">
                                <p><em>Updated 4/4/2020</em></p>
<p>As of April 3, 2020, the CDC changed its recommendation regarding the wearing of face cover for asymptomatic persons (persons not experiencing COVID-19 symptoms) when they are in public settings, especially settings in which public distancing is difficult to maintain. The CDC now recommends that cloth face cover be worn in public settings by all individuals without COVID-19 symptoms.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This revised recommendation is based upon evidence that &ldquo;a significant portion of individuals with COVID-19 lack symptoms (&ldquo;asymptomatic&rdquo;), and that individuals who eventually develop symptoms (&ldquo;pre-symptomatic&rdquo;) can transmit the virus to others before showing symptoms.&rdquo;  People can transmit the COVID-19 virus before showing symptoms when interacting in close proximity to others (e.g., speaking, coughing, sneezing). Therefore, wearing cloth face cover in public settings is a prevention step for the transmission of COVID-19 by asymptomatic individuals.</p>
<p>It is important to note that recommended cloth face cover is NOT surgical masks or N-95 respirators. Surgical masks and N-95 respirators are critical supplies needed for healthcare workers and medical first responders. The CDC states that cloth face cover can be fashioned from household items or made at home from common materials at low cost. </p>
<h4>Face cover should:</h4>
<ul>
    <li>cover your nose and mouth</li>
    <li>fit snugly but comfortably against the side of the face</li>
    <li>be secured with ties or ear loops</li>
    <li>include multiple layers of fabric</li>
    <li>allow for breathing without restriction</li>
    <li>be able to be laundered and machine dried without damage or change to shape</li>
</ul>
<h4>The CDC cautions to NOT place face cover on:</h4>
<ul>
    <li>children under the age of 2</li>
    <li>anyone having trouble breathing</li>
    <li>anyone unconscious, incapacitated or otherwise unable to remove the face cover</li>
</ul>

</ul>
<p>Suffolk University is currently requiring travelers from CDC level 3 high risk countries (whether they are with or without symptoms) to<strong> not come to campus, not be in a residence hall, or not attend any Suffolk sponsored events until 14 days after their first day of arrival in the U.S. Suffolk strongly advises such individuals to follow Self-Quarantine instructions described below.</strong></p>
<p>Suffolk strongly advises such individuals to follow Self-Quarantine instructions described here. Should a student require immediate administrative assistance regarding implementation of University quarantine guidelines, they should:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Boston Campus CAS/SBS students: call the Office of Student Affairs (617-573-8239) during business hours or call Suffolk Police (617-573-8333) after business hours and request to receive a call from the Dean on Call.</li>
    <li>School of Law students: call the Law School Dean of Students Office (617-573-8157) during business hours or call Suffolk Police (617-573-8333) and request to receive a call from the Law School Dean of Students.</li>
    <li>Madrid Campus students: call the Madrid Campus (+34) 91-533-5935 during business hours, or call Madrid Staff on Call at (+34) 628-294-290 after business hours to speak with a Madrid campus staff member.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Self-Quarantine Steps &ndash; COVID-19 </h4>
<p>The purpose of self-quarantine is to separate and prevent the movement of asymptomatic people who have been exposed to or at higher risk of having been exposed to an infectious disease, in this case, COVID-19. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Self-quarantine&rdquo; means that you will have to stay home and monitor yourself for any potential signs of infection&mdash;coughing, fever, chills or muscle aches&mdash;for the duration of the incubation period (14 days), checking your temperature in the morning and evening, </p>
<p>Stay at home means you cannot go to work or school, attend social activities, or visit any public places. </p>
<ul>
    <li>If possible, you should stay in a well-ventilated room that is your own living space in a home or apartment setting. </li>
    <li>Do not spend time with family or friends in person. </li>
    <li>Do keep in touch with friends, significant others, and family via phone or text as this is important to supporting your well-being. </li>
    <li>Do not have contact with family pets or animals. </li>
    <li>If you live with others, it&rsquo;s recommended to have separate sleeping quarters (sleeping alone in a separate room). </li>
    <li>It&rsquo;s also preferable to have your own bathroom. If you must share one, it&rsquo;s vital to clean it after every use, using disinfectants that contain at least 60-90% alcohol or bleach-based cleaning wipes. </li>
    <li>Use your own dishes, drinking glasses and eating utensils; do not share with others. </li>
    <li>Meal delivery is acceptable, but it must be left outside your door or room. </li>
    <li>Hand washing is paramount. Frequent hand-washing with soap and warm, running water for at least 20 seconds is important; if soap and  water are not readily available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60 percent alcohol. </li>
    <li>If you develop a fever or a cough and/or breathing difficulties, contact a medical provider or hospital ER by phone. </li>
    <li>If you develop a fever or a cough and/or breathing difficulties, wear a mask if others need to enter your room for emergency care. </li>
</ul>

                                <p>Dear Colleagues,</p>
<p>As planning for the fall semester and the gradual reopening of campus operations and activities continues, I write to update you with some details on current expectations for employees, some planning principles, and a preliminary timetable for additional information.</p>
<p>As previously announced, all summer classes will be held online, and in most cases, we will continue to operate remotely until at least July 1. Essential personnel will continue to provide critical services that are required on campus, but most employees should expect to work remotely through the end of June, and perhaps longer.</p>
<p>The health and safety of our students and employees remains paramount. We are using the rest of May and the month of June to further plan for gradual reopening of on-campus operations, with the intention of keeping these to a minimum for most of the summer. Our on-campus operations will gradually expand as we move toward the fall. All of this will be done in line with public health guidance and the requirements provided by the state and city.</p>
<p>As you know, a number of University working groups are developing plans for the fall semester and will make recommendations to the University's COVID-19 task force on academic activities, student life, health and safety, and other areas. A link to the various planning groups working on preparations and policies can be found on <a href="/about/president-leadership/provost">the Provost's Office web page</a>. Among those groups, the Safe Actions for Employee Return (SAFER) group, led by Chief Human Resources Officer Boris Lazic, will make recommendations on the policies, processes, changes in operation, and communication that we need to bring employees back to campus in a safe, orderly, and strategic fashion. SAFER is a University-wide group that includes representatives of exempt and non-exempt employees, as well as employees who are student facing and those who are not, and academic representation from all three schools.</p>
<p>Senior Associate Provost Gary Fireman is working with the Office of Environmental Health and Safety and faculty to develop a process to safely allow resumption of certain research laboratory activities, in line with Phase 1 of the governor's guidelines for Massachusetts.</p>
<p>The planning groups will make recommendations to the University task force by the first week in June, and the task force will in turn make recommendations to me.</p>
<p>I will update you with further details, including preliminary FY21 budget actions, through a virtual town hall meeting for employees to be held at 2 p.m. Wednesday, June 10. The town hall also will include other members of the University's leadership team. Specific details about accessing that town hall meeting will be communicated in the coming days.</p>
<p>Again, all of the ongoing planning for the fall will be done in accordance with guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and state and local health officials, as well as with the governor and mayor's guidelines for institutes of higher education, which are still under development.</p>
<p>I continue to wish you and your families good health and a happy Memorial Day weekend to all.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Marisa Kelly<br />
President</p>

                                <p>Dear Colleagues,</p>
<p>As you know, it has been our hope to hold a face-to-face commencement for the class of 2020 this August. We believe that the public health situation will not allow us to do so. As such, we now hope to hold a ceremony for the class of 2020 in May of 2021.</p>
<p>The message below was sent to our recent graduates yesterday. While it is difficult to wait a full year, we will look forward to celebrating the class of 2020 and their many accomplishments at that time.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Marisa Kelly<br />
President</p>
<p>_________________________________________________________________</p>
<p>To our graduating students,</p>
<p>On behalf of the entire Suffolk community, I want to offer my sincere congratulations on completing your Suffolk degrees. Your achievements would be impressive under normal circumstances. But those accomplishments are all the more remarkable in the face of a pandemic that has caused both tragedy, distress, and dramatic changes in the way you have had to live and learn. For all that you have accomplished in the face of extreme adversity, we are very proud of you. You have proven beyond measure that you are determined, resilient, and creative in how you approach your work. That will serve you well as you pursue your professional and personal goals, both now and over the course of your lives.</p>
<p>Gathering to celebrate your accomplishments remains one of the University's highest priorities. In March I told you we would postpone rather than cancel Commencement ceremonies. While some universities were shifting to virtual graduations, I have felt that this moment is so important to you, your loved ones, and to this University community that we need to come together and celebrate in person, if at all possible. As much as we wanted to commence on our scheduled date this month, the pandemic made that impossible, and I know that has been so very disappointing. For that reason, we had hoped to schedule a commencement celebration in August. But we expect public health conditions and guidelines will continue to prevent large groups to safely gather, so we have looked further out on the calendar.</p>
<p>While I wish it could be sooner, I am pleased to announce that we have scheduled a Commencement celebration for the class of 2020 to be held on Sunday, May 23, 2021-- just over a year from now -- at the Rockland Trust Bank Pavilion in Boston. Exploration of earlier dates this coming fall made clear that a celebration at that time would be highly unlikely. I am guardedly confident that by May of 2021 public health conditions and guidelines will allow us to bring our graduates and their families safely together to celebrate. We looked to pick a time that gave us the best chance of being able to move forward with celebrations while allowing as many graduates and their families as possible to attend. The planned Commencement celebration schedule is:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Sawyer Business School at 9 a.m.</li>
    <li>College of Arts &amp; Sciences at 1:30 p.m.</li>
    <li>Law School at 5:30 p.m. </li>
</ul>
<p>We will celebrate the graduating class of 2021 on the following day.</p>
<p>Yours will be a unique celebration, reflecting what has been a distinct experience for the class of 2020. Even as we honor your academic accomplishments, we will mark your return as members of our alumni community. I hope you will save the date for a celebration that we hope will be worth waiting for and one to remember. If you have completed your degree program and other requirements, you are a graduate of this institution as of yesterday, May 17, 2020. Diplomas are being mailed to graduates now.</p>
<p>Again, please accept my heartiest congratulations on your accomplishments and my wishes for your continued health and safety and that of your loved ones.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Marisa Kelly<br />
President</p>

                                <p>To our students,</p>
<p>I hope that this email finds you and your families safe and well. My thoughts have been with you during exam week and as a semester that none of us will ever forget comes to a close. Despite all of the challenges, including the shift to virtual learning, I hope you have had a successful academic year.</p>
<p>The University is at this moment engaged in an extensive planning process to ensure that in the coming academic year we will be prepared to provide our students with the transformational educational experiences that are at the heart of a Suffolk education. It is too soon to know the exact conditions in which we will operate at the start of the fall semester, or all of the public health recommendations pertaining to COVID-19 that will guide us. Planning, however, is moving forward, and we are preparing for a number of scenarios, always with the health and safety of our students and employees as our highest priority.</p>
<p>While there is much that remains unknown, I can tell you with certainty that Suffolk University will be open this fall and fully prepared to deliver on our educational mission. We will start our academic year according to our normal calendar. It is our hope and intention to hold in-person classes and activities at our Boston and Madrid campuses. However, to ensure the health and safety of our community and the broader public, we are also very likely to need a mix of face-to-face and virtual operations that allow for social distancing. We are engaged in careful planning so that we are ready for a wide range of possibilities, and final decisions will be made in light of guidelines set by government and public health officials.</p>
<p>Groups made up of administrators and faculty with expertise from across the University are working to address scenarios related to course delivery and schedules, campus and residence hall life, the cocurricular experience, international programs, and of course, health and safety. A health subcommittee is developing medical and health guidelines to limit the risk of COVID-19 transmission and to protect Suffolk community members, including medically vulnerable populations, as the University transitions back to campus in the fall. That committee will make recommendations on precautionary measures we can take to reduce risk, including social distancing, face covering, accommodations and protections for vulnerable populations, and other areas. COVID-19 testing and contact tracing will be integrated into our operational plan for the fall.</p>
<p>The recommendations from these working groups will be gathered by the COVID-19 Task Force that has been operating since early March, and will inform the final decisions made about the next academic year and the specifics of our operations. We will update you with details on our plans as soon as they become available. We know international students may face special challenges, especially related to visas. A more detailed message from Vice President of International Affairs Sebasti&aacute;n Royo will be forthcoming for those students.</p>
<p>In the meantime, please know that we are committed to our mission and to all of you. We will chart a course for the fall designed to continue to help you achieve your educational goals in and out of the classroom. And until we gather together again, whether in person or virtually, we want to stay connected. Please do not hesitate to reach out to a faculty member, an adviser, to a mentor in your school or in Student Affairs if you have questions. We are here to support you.</p>
<p>My continued best wishes for your health and safety and that of all your loved ones.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Marisa Kelly<br />

<h5>Students &ndash; Suffolk-Sponsored Travel</h5>
<ol>
    <li>All outbound <em>and</em> inbound&nbsp;Suffolk-sponsored international&nbsp;travel by students and employees through May 31, 2020, have been canceled.</li>
    <li>Decisions about Suffolk-sponsored international trips and international travel seminars scheduled to run later in the Spring and Summer have not been made, but we will continue to monitor the situation.</li>
    <li>All Suffolk-sponsored domestic travel will be evaluated on a case by case basis. Students should contact their trip leaders for more information.&nbsp; Trip leaders should contact the Dean of Students, Ann Coyne, or the Dean of Students at the Law School, Laura Ferrari, as applicable.</li>
    <li>In order to manage the logistics and the financial consequences in this uncertain time, students should not book flights for Suffolk-sponsored travel on their own.&nbsp; All flight bookings will be managed centrally through the Center for International Programs and Services (CIPS).&nbsp; Students who have already purchased flights should not make changes in their flights until instructed to do so.</li>
    <li>If a student studying abroad returns to the United States from any country for which the&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/notices" target="_blank">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)</a>&nbsp;has issued a Warning Level 3 notice or for which the&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/traveladvisories/traveladvisories.html/" target="_blank">United States Department of State</a>&nbsp;has issued a Level 3 or Level 4 Travel Advisory for COVID-19, that student must successfully complete a 14-day self-quarantine period <em>off campus</em>, before being permitted to attend any Suffolk-sponsored activities, attend classes, or be present in a Suffolk residence hall.</li>

                                <p>The Off-Campus Housing Office (OCHO) has received inquiries from students and family members about continuing to live in an off-campus apartment or ending their lease since the University has moved to virtual learning. We have prepared the following information to assist you in considering your options.</p>
<h4>Your Tenant Responsibilities</h4>
<p>Students are legally responsible for complying with the terms of the rental lease signed including ensuring they pay their rent in full and on time. Failure to pay the rent can result in the landlord taking you to Small Claims Court.&nbsp;Students who wish end the apartment lease early should contact the landlord or property manager to discuss options. More information about tenant responsibilities may be found at <a rel="noopener noreferrer" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.masslegalhelp.org/housing/lt1-chapter-11-your-responsibilities" target="_blank">the Mass Legal Help Website</a>.</p>
<h4>Subletting</h4>
<p>Students who wish to move out of their apartment but not end the lease, might consider subletting the apartment if permitted in the lease or through discussions with the landlord, but you should note that many leases do not allow for subleasing.&nbsp; If subleasing is allowed under the lease, OCHO can help. You may list sublets or find roommates on <a rel="noopener noreferrer" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://offcampushousing.suffolk.edu/" target="_blank">the OCHO on-line housing website</a>.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Post an apartment or room: You can list an apartment or room for free online.&nbsp; Once you log into the website using your Suffolk University email credentials, you have the ability to post pictures and details of the room or unit.&nbsp;You can find this under "My Account" page, under the Housing header, "Add Listing."</li>
    <li>Post a roommate profile: You can create a roommate profile under the "Roommate" tab, noting that they are "Looking for a Roommate."&nbsp; Profiles can be viewed by the Suffolk community as well as neighboring institutions.&nbsp;You can also <a href="mailto:ocho@suffolk.edu">email</a> the Off-Campus Housing Office for additional options as management companies are sharing March and April openings.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Moving &amp; Storage Information</h4>
<p><a href="/-/media/suffolk/documents/student-life/health-and-wellness/coronavirus-health-advisory/storage_options.pdf?la=en&amp;hash=93D297783BDDA162394B82DCB1AC7E7784CF214C">A list of moving and storage companies is included here [PDF]</a>. Suffolk University does not endorse any of the companies listed.</p>
<h4>If You Need Medical Assistance while Living in a Local Off-Campus Apartment</h4>
<p>As communicated in previous COVID-19 Suffolk health advisories, you should consult with a medical provider:</p>
<ul>
    <li>If you develop symptoms of a fever AND a cough OR shortness of breath AND you have recently traveled in China, Iran, Italy, OR South Korea OR</li>
    <li>If you have had exposure to a person diagnosed with COVID-19 OR</li>
    <li>If you have had exposure to a person who is being evaluated for COVID-19.</li>
</ul>
<p>You may call Counseling, Health and Wellness at 617-573-8260 during business hours or your medical provider at home. Do not go to the offices before calling and speaking with someone. After business hours, please call Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) Emergency Department at 617-724-4100 or your local hospital emergency room.</p>
<h4>Off-Campus Student Behavior</h4>
<p>OCHO encourages students living in off-campus apartments to practice social distancing and limit contact with large crowds. Also, please continue to demonstrate responsible citizenship in your local neighborhoods.</p>
<h4>Contacting OCHO</h4>
<p>If you have any questions, please <a href="mailto:ocho@suffolk.edu">contact</a> OCHO. The office is open and operating and is available for in-person and virtual meetings with students. Please call OCHO at 617-573-8647 to schedule a convenient appointment.</p>

<ol>
    <li>The employee should stay home or go home and immediately seek medical guidance.</li>
    <li>The employee should consult with  their healthcare provider  and follow their healthcare provider&rsquo;s guidance  OR call a COVID-19 health resource and  follow their guidance:
    <ol>
        <li>The Massachusetts General COVID-19 hotline at 617-724-7000 is open 8 a.m.&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;8 p.m., 7 days a week. After 8 p.m., call your local hospital ER.</li>
        <li>The Boston Public Health Commission at 617-534-5050.</li>
    </ol>
    </li>
    <li>The employee should notify their manager&nbsp;about how medical guidance will impact their work attendance, if this is the case. <em>Please note: If medical guidance indicates that your concern about coronavirus exposure does not warrant self-quarantine or self-isolation, you can return to work if you are not ill, or contact your manager about work from home options.</em></li>
    <li>If an employee needs to remain home from work per medical guidance, they should contact our 3rd party administrator, Sedgwick, at&nbsp;888-436-9530.&nbsp; Sedgwick is our third-party absence management administrator providing consultation and administrative support.</li>
    <li>The Suffolk HR Benefit Leave Administrator will be notified by Sedgwick and will follow up with the employee&rsquo;s manager and the employee to review next steps.  For any questions about this or leave of absence,&nbsp;<a href="mailto:Humanresources@suffolk.edu">email Human Resources</a>.</li>
</ol>
<h4>Concerns about Students</h4>
<p>Faculty and staff responding to questions from students about coronavirus are encouraged to refer students to these advisory pages for more information.&nbsp; Faculty and staff should also instruct students who are concerned about their own health related to coronavirus to call CHW (617-573-8260) to speak with a Nurse Practitioner.</p>
<h4>Employee Support</h4>
<p>Suffolk employees with questions about their health related to coronavirus should contact their personal health providers.&nbsp; We are aware some employees may have family or loved ones impacted by coronavirus, and others may be experiencing increased distress or worry related to the outbreak.&nbsp; Employees in need of emotional support are encouraged to contact EAP resources for assistance.&nbsp;For more information visit&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://helloe4.com/" target="_blank">their website</a>, enter &ldquo;Suffolk University&rdquo; for company name, and &ldquo;guest&rdquo; for the password, or call them at 1-800-828-6025.</p>
