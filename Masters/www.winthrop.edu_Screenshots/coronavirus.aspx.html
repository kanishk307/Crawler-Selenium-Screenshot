                           <p>As you know, Phase 2 of Winthrop’s Return to Work Plan&nbsp;begins on Monday, July 6.&nbsp;This
                              means that some of you will return to your offices either full time, in some combination
                              of working on campus and working from home, and some will continue to fully work from
                              home. During Phase 2, the goal is to have no more than approximately 50 percent of
                              our workforce on campus on any given day. Campus buildings will be open and we will
                              return to providing our regular services, but in a modified format so that we can
                              promote social distancing.

                                 spaces on campus where appropriate social distancing cannot be guaranteed. Facial
                                 coverings are not required when alone in private offices, when alone in on-campus
                                 residence hall rooms and when not in close contact with another person, such as walking
                                 alone outside.

                              <li>We must practice proper hygiene such as hand washing and social distancing as the
                                 CDC and DHEC recommend.&nbsp;
                              </li>
                              
                              <li>When possible, meetings should not be face-to-face. The use of telephone, e-mail or
                                 one of the virtual meeting platforms would be preferred to limit interactions among
                                 individuals.&nbsp;
                              </li>
                              
                              <li>Employees are encouraged to self-monitor frequently for any possible symptoms such
                                 as fever, cough, etc
                              </li>
                              
                           </ul>
                           
                           
                           <p>Regarding the importance of self-monitoring, in&nbsp;normal times, many of us would not
                              think twice of coming to work with a runny nose or scratchy throat and go on about
                              our work day, but at this time we are asking you to contact your supervisor and stay
                              home if you have even the slightest feeling of being unwell. This is out of an abundance
                              of caution for our campus community. 
                           </p>
                           
                           <p>&nbsp; </p>
                           
                           <p>We are also asking, if you have physically been in settings or attended events where
                              social distancing was not possible&nbsp;and face coverings were not worn or&nbsp;have&nbsp;been traveling
                              (including airplanes, cruise ships, etc.)&nbsp;to please contact and inform your supervisor&nbsp;to
                              determine the appropriateness of your returning to work in person on campus. 
                           </p>
                           
                           <p>&nbsp; </p>
                           
                           <p>It is imperative to look at your personal decisions over this week and last, and ascertain
                              as much as possible your risk of potentially having been exposed yet be asymptomatic.
                              This is a necessary step we all must take before the&nbsp;July 6&nbsp;Phase 2 opening. If you
                              do think you may have been exposed, please contact HR for guidance. 
                           </p>
                           
                           
                           <p>While we are doing all that we can from an institutional standpoint to provide a safe
                              and healthy work environment, we simply cannot control every variable. I am asking
                              each of us - by wearing a mask, self-monitoring, practicing good hygiene and social
                              distancing, and more - to do our part to help keep our campus healthy and safe.&nbsp; 
                           </p>
                           
                           
                           <p>Finally, as of now, we continue to plan for our Phase 3 opening&nbsp;on July 27&nbsp;during
                              which we will welcome nearly 100 percent of our employees back to campus.&nbsp;We are keeping
                              a close eye on the rise in COVID-19 cases in our area and will keep you informed if
                              this changes. 
                           </p>
                           
                           
                           <p>Thank you for all that you have done, and continue to do, for Winthrop during these
                              uncertain times. I look forward to talking soon to as many of you as I can (while
                              practicing social distancing of course!)

                           <p>Since yesterday's e-mail focused on our return to work planning, I  wanted to update
                              you today on several academic initiatives that currently are  underway as we continue
                              to work towards safely welcoming our students back in  August.

                           <p>Provost and Executive Vice  President for Academic Affairs Adrienne McCormick shared
                              last week with the  campus the&nbsp;<a href="/news-events/modifications-made-to-winthrop-universitys-fall-2020-academic-schedule.aspx" title="https://www.winthrop.edu/news-events/modifications-made-to-winthrop-universitys-fall-2020-academic-schedule.aspx">approved  academic calendar</a>&nbsp;for the fall semester. I'm sure you noticed several  modifications, but the highlights
                              include holding classes on Labor Day;  forgoing&nbsp;fall break&nbsp;in October; canceling classes
                              on Election Day;  concluding face-to-face instruction&nbsp;before Thanksgiving break; and
                              moving  to remote instruction after Thanksgiving to complete the fall semester. I
                              appreciate the input from the campus community as we worked to create a  modified
                              schedule that would&nbsp;minimize travel to and from campus in order  to avoid potential
                              increased instances of COVID-19.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p>I also wanted to share several other items of interest: </p>
                           
                           <ul>
                              
                              <li>The Academic Affairs division has been hard at work planning       and scheduling
                                 fall courses to accommodate our reduced on-campus class       sizes in order to effectively
                                 social distance students in the classroom.       To date, 41 percent of our classes
                                 will be in-person, on-campus courses,       32 percent of classes will be a hybrid
                                 of online and on-campus       instruction, and 27 percent of classes will be offered
                                 solely online. 
                              </li>
                              
                              <li>Staff members are rearranging classrooms and lecture halls in       order to enforce
                                 social distancing. Regular classroom settings will       operate at 40 percent capacity.
                                 Extra chairs and desks will be removed in       order to abide by social distancing
                                 recommendations. Lecture halls or       spaces with fixed seating will operate at
                                 20 percent capacity. Signage       will be placed on the floors of these rooms to
                                 indicate which seats should       be used and which rows are unavailable.&nbsp; 
                              </li>
                              
                              <li>Faculty members have remained dedicated to ensuring that our       students receive
                                 high quality online academic instruction and offerings.       Through training offered
                                 by the Winthrop Office of Online Learning, to       date, a total of&nbsp;164 faculty members
                                 are now fully certified to       provide online instruction.&nbsp;In addition, 188 faculty
                                 members       completed Winthrop Online Teaching Certification (WOTC) 101: Online
                                 Course       Design and Development Basics and more than 145 faculty members completed
                                 WOTC 102: Online Course Facilitation and Management.

                              <li>Winthrop will soon have its own Zoom account that will be       utilized in the fall
                                 across campus, in addition to other platforms       currently available. 
                              </li>
                              
                              <li>Academic Leadership is working with IT to provide most, if       not all, full-time
                                 faculty with a laptop to allow for flexibility. In addition,       the IT call center&nbsp;is
                                 moving to a cloud-based system which will       allow&nbsp;the IT staff to respond to calls
                                 while off campus in case the       university has to pivot to remote work again.

                              <li>A Return to Learn website is underway to provide a one-stop       resource for students,
                                 parents, faculty and staff as they navigate the new       semester. In addition, since
                                 we know the campus community, our students       and their families will have questions
                                 about the new semester and how it       will look, we will offer a series of town
                                 halls to provide an opportunity       for questions and answers using one of the virtual
                                 platforms. More       information will be coming soon on the town hall series. 
                              </li>
                              
                              <li>In Student Affairs,&nbsp;the Office of New Student and Family       Programs is currently
                                 in the midst of welcoming&nbsp;both freshmen and new       transfer students. These students
                                 are currently completing the first part       of our Orientation offerings, the virtual
                                 First Flight component, along       with advising and registration. Once these students
                                 arrive on campus in       August, they will complete the second component of Orientation
                                 - Eagles       Landing. 
                              </li>
                              
                              <li>The Convocation Committee is exploring options for an       outdoor, progressive Blue
                                 Line walk with stops that would help us provide       a safe alternate to our typical
                                 Convocation for incoming students. More       information will be forthcoming on this
                                 semester-opening event. 
                              </li>
                              
                              <li>Finally, as we see the rise in COVID-19 cases happening       locally and across the
                                 state, the Commencement Committee has determined       that a traditional, in-person
                                 Commencement ceremony&nbsp;on Aug. 15&nbsp;to       celebrate our May graduates is not the safest
                                 way to welcome our newest       graduates into the Winthrop family. A survey will
                                 be sent this week to our       May graduates to gather their feedback on other options
                                 and formats that       will allow us to safely celebrate with them and their families.
                                 More       information will be shared soon.

                           <p>As you can see, a lot of hard work has been taking place across  the university to
                              prepare for the fall semester. I thank you all for your part  in these efforts. As
                              I've said before, the Winthrop spirit is real, and it is  on display as the campus
                              community works together to safely welcome back our  students.&nbsp;

                           <p>It is less than one week until our scheduled return to work for Phase 2, and more
                              concerning news has been recently shared that emphasizes why we must be vigilant between
                              now and&nbsp;July 6&nbsp;as we prepare to return to work. Please note that a detailed Return
                              to Work Guide will be forthcoming this week.&nbsp; 
                           </p>
                           
                           
                           <p>While the administration is readying the physical campus for your return and implementing
                              necessary precautions to decrease any spread of COVID-19, you must be equally committed
                              in the coming days to protecting yourself and tangentially our community, as cases
                              continue to rise throughout many areas in the Carolinas.&nbsp; 
                           </p>
                           
                           
                           <p>The Herald reported that York County added a total of 103 COVID-19 cases this past
                              weekend, which ended a record-breaking week of new cases. In order to keep ourselves,
                              our family members and our colleagues healthy and safe,&nbsp;<strong><em>we should all be wearing masks or cloth facial coverings anytime we are in public</em></strong>&nbsp;with the potential for contact with others.&nbsp;We must practice hand washing and social
                              distancing as the CDC and DHEC recommend. Again, this is not only for our own health
                              but the health of our campus colleagues and friends, which is an important component
                              of the Winthrop spirit I’ve seen so consistently displayed during the pandemic.&nbsp; 
                           </p>
                           
                           
                           <p>I also wanted to make you aware of several other items happening concerning campus
                              preparations:&nbsp; 
                           </p>
                           
                           <ul>
                              
                              <li>Following CDC and DHEC guidance, Winthrop&nbsp;is requiring all staff, faculty and students
                                 to wear masks or cloth facial coverings in social settings, such as in university
                                 buildings, including classrooms, residence halls and dining facilities, and in outdoor
                                 spaces on campus where appropriate social distancing cannot be guaranteed. Facial
                                 coverings are not required when alone in private offices, when alone in on-campus
                                 residence hall rooms and when not in close contact with another person, such as walking
                                 alone outside. Also in accordance with CDC and DHEC guidance, Winthrop<strong>&nbsp;</strong>is not requiring baseline COVID-19 testing for faculty, staff and students who return
                                 to campus. COVID-19 testing options for those who become symptomatic will be available
                                 through local health-care facilities. 
                              </li>
                              
                              <li>Should it be required,&nbsp;contact tracing will be provided by DHEC in communication with
                                 Health and Counseling Services for students and Human Resources for employees. 
                              </li>
                              
                              <li>Return to work kits will soon be available from Environmental Health and Safety for
                                 departments and offices. Supervisors will be notified of pick-up arrangements. Kits
                                 include reusable cloth facial coverings (two per employee), disposable masks for office
                                 visitors, a 22 oz. bottle of hand sanitizer for office/department use, a 32 oz. bottle
                                 of disinfectant cleaner for office/department use, gloves and paper towels. No wipes
                                 or personal-sized hand sanitizers will be available for each employee's desk.&nbsp;&nbsp;
                              </li>
                              
                              <li>We are consulting with the Medical University of South Carolina on our Return to Learn
                                 plan, which details our preparations to safely welcome our students, faculty and staff
                                 back to campus for the fall semester.&nbsp;Being reviewed are our social distancing plans
                                 for classroom, residence halls and shared spaces such as Dacus Library, in addition
                                 to our plans for returning employees to the campus. MUSC will evaluate these plans
                                 and give suggestions and guidance as to how we might adjust them if needed.
                              </li>
                              
                              <li>Finally, I would like to encourage each employee to complete the required, mandatory
                                 Return to Work Authorization training as soon as possible. Employees will not be allowed
                                 to return to campus until this training is completed. This information can be found
                                 at the&nbsp;“Faculty and Staff Return to Work Notification, Training, and Resources” section
                                 of the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.winthrop.edu/hr/covid19.aspx" title="https://www.winthrop.edu/hr/covid19.aspx">HR website</a>.&nbsp;

                           <p>It is with anticipation that I look forward to seeing you back on campus. Working
                              remotely has served the university as well as we might have imagined but like you,
                              I suspect, I have missed the opportunity to see each other on a daily basis. As we
                              enter Phase 2 of re-opening, I ask you to pay attention to these guidelines as it
                              is with care and respect for each other that we need to work to create a healthy and
                              safe campus.
                           </p>

                           <p>Thank you for your patience as Winthrop begins to slowly, and with guidance from the
                              State, open its doors after our extended closure. We successfully began&nbsp;<u>Phase 1</u>&nbsp;of our three-phase plan on June 1 with all Facilities Management (FM) employees,
                              essential employees who have been working on campus since the closure, and other employees
                              who were identified within their divisions as unable to work from home, all now on
                              the job handling their duties from their campus work areas. We appreciate all of you
                              who never left and those who have made it back!

                           <p>I want to take a moment to share that July 6, 2020, will be our&nbsp;<u>Phase 2&nbsp;</u>implementation date. &nbsp;We’re nearly two weeks into Phase 1, and things have gone smoothly.
                              However, there is still much to do before we are ready for 50 percent of the workforce
                              to be back on campus. Vice President for HR Lisa Cowart will be in touch in the next
                              day or two by email with the many details you will need to know to successfully report
                              back to work July 6 if you are part of Phase 2 (most of us are). For additional planning
                              purposes, our tentative date to begin&nbsp;<u>Phase 3</u>&nbsp;will be July 27.

                              the media today. We continue to work through additional details as we prepare to welcome
                              back our students in August.&nbsp; Please know that the health and safety of each student
                              and employee is at the forefront of every decision that is made. Thank you once again

                           <p>ROCK HILL, SOUTH CAROLINA - Interim President George W. Hynd announced today&nbsp;that
                              Winthrop University will make changes to its fall 2020 academic schedule due to COVID-19.
                              There will be&nbsp;no fall break&nbsp;in October; the university will conclude face-to-face
                              instruction&nbsp;before Thanksgiving break; and then Winthrop will move to remote instruction
                              to complete the fall semester.&nbsp; 
                           </p>
                           
                           
                           <p>"These schedule changes will hopefully help mitigate a possible spike in COVID-19
                              when traditionally thousands of students, faculty and staff would be returning to
                              campus after a few days away. We weighed the public health risks of having our campus
                              community return from these breaks, and the risks&nbsp;were significant as the country
                              may be facing a second wave of COVID-19 at the same time that we typically experience
                              an uptick in&nbsp;seasonal flu cases,” said Hynd. “We feel that this move,&nbsp;which also has&nbsp;been
                              introduced by some other South Carolina universities, will help keep our students
                              and employees safe, all while continuing to focus on delivering the best learning
                              experience for our students.” 
                           </p>
                           
                           
                           <p>While the university will welcome back the majority of its students to in-person classes
                              in August, Hynd noted that administrators&nbsp;continue to work through details of&nbsp;how
                              in-person instruction will look in order to maximize social distancing and keep the
                              community safe. Winthrop is&nbsp;planning for the majority of classes to be on campus,
                              but some courses will have to be shifted online that were initially planned for in-person
                              instruction, in order to spread courses out across classrooms and scheduled meeting
                              times. 
                           </p>
                           
                           
                           <p>According to Adrienne McCormick, provost and executive vice president for academic
                              affairs,&nbsp;faculty members will build their fall course plans and determine how the
                              final weeks of course material will be covered remotely. “This course planning will
                              differ significantly from the spring since the hybrid content delivery will be planned
                              from the start. The expectations for student work during that time after Thanksgiving
                              will depend on the courses they are taking, but in general, the final week of content
                              and all final exams will be delivered and completed via remote instruction,” said
                              McCormick.

                           <p>While fall planning continues,&nbsp;Winthrop looks to welcome a small group of students
                              back onto campus for a few Summer Session D courses, which&nbsp;begin on July 13. Those
                              few in-person courses include three sections of anatomy and physiology and the corresponding
                              labs and a graduate education course. All other Summer Session offerings will be delivered
                              remotely. Additionally, during&nbsp;the month of July, there will be select student and
                              faculty in-person research taking place on campus as part of the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.winthrop.edu/eaglestem/index.aspx" title="https://www.winthrop.edu/eaglestem/index.aspx">Eagle STEM Scholars program</a>&nbsp;and the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.winthrop.edu/undergradresearch/summer-undergraduate-research-experience.aspx" title="https://www.winthrop.edu/undergradresearch/summer-undergraduate-research-experience.aspx">Summer Undergraduate Research Experience (SURE)</a>.

                                 on August Re-opening</strong></p>
                           
                           <p>ROCK HILL, SOUTH CAROLINA—As administrators plan for the fall semester opening, Winthrop
                              University Interim President George W. Hynd announced today that he will recommend
                              to the Board of Trustees’ finance committee and full board to hold tuition constant
                              at 2019-20 levels for the 2020-21 academic year. Board members will hold their regularly
                              scheduled meeting June 18-19, 2020.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p>“The students and families we serve are largely South Carolinians who have been struggling
                              under the weight of a shuttered economy for an extended time,” Hynd said. “Our recent
                              decisions to reduce summer tuition, temporarily suspend standardized test scores for
                              admission, and make spring fee adjustments all were intended to help students continue
                              or begin their Winthrop experiences. Keeping tuition at 2019-20 levels is another
                              way we can show prospective and returning students that the Winthrop family stands
                              ready to assist them in fulfilling their educational goals, even in uncertain times.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p>At the June board meeting trustees will hear details of Winthrop’s plan to open the
                              campus for new and returning students in August. Hynd noted that senior leaders are
                              focusing on how in-person instruction will look in order to maximize social distancing
                              and keep the community safe. “While we are planning for the majority of classes to
                              be on campus, we will offer some classes online or hybrid classes blending campus-based
                              and online instruction,” he said. &nbsp;“Class sizes, scheduling and locations are being
                              evaluated to help protect students, faculty and staff from COVID-19.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p>Hynd also noted that residence halls will be available in the fall, but on a reduced
                              basis in order to minimize the use of shared bathrooms. “We continue to work on determining
                              the exact number of students we can safely accommodate in the halls and to partner
                              with dining service provider Sodexo on safe practices. We do expect significant revenue
                              implications in both of these auxiliary areas,” Hynd said.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p>On a brighter note, the interim president said he is pleased with progress on the
                              university’s return to work plan, guided by the S.C. State Administrative Department
                              and facilitated by Winthrop’s Office of Human Resources, Employee Diversity and Wellness.
                              The&nbsp;<a title="three-phase plan" href="/uploadedFiles/hr/time-leave/ReturnToWork.pdf">three-phase plan (pdf - 227 KB)</a>&nbsp;beginning June 1 intends to return most of the workforce to the campus sometime this
                              summer.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p>Each Winthrop division has been assessing needs and making plans to return to operations
                              within a predominantly socially distanced work environment. The university’s environmental
                              health and safety office and critical incident management team have been researching
                              and implementing best practices in the run-up to June 1. &nbsp;
                           </p>
                           
                           <p>“We look forward to the day when our full complement of employees may return to campus
                              energized and ready to safely provide the exemplary educational experience our students
                              and their families have come to expect,” Hynd said. “At this time we do not know exactly
                              what day that will be, but we will be prepared and eager to welcome students back
                              to campus.”

                        <ol class="noindent fyNoShow" id="d12e516" type="A">
                           
                           <p>Dear Colleagues:</p>
                           
                           <p>First, let me take this opportunity to thank all of you for your extraordinary patience
                              and understanding as to the many uncertainties that have emerged during these unprecedented
                              times.&nbsp; You have clearly demonstrated the essence of Winthrop Spirit!
                           </p>
                           
                           <p>One of the most frequent questions we receive is when will the staff and faculty be
                              able to return to work again on campus. To that end, many of you may have heard Governor's
                              McMaster's announcement this week about state employees returning to work. I want
                              to reassure you that the senior leadership is carefully reviewing the guidance received
                              from the State Human Resources division and is incorporating that guidance into our
                              planning that, as previously mentioned, is already underway.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p>What is positive about the state's three-phase plan is that we are being given significant
                              discretion to manage our workforce. In addition, because of the success of employees
                              adapting to working from home, we expect to continue liberal work-from-home practices
                              to promote social distancing and mitigate disease transmission.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p>We know that the&nbsp;<u>First Phase</u>&nbsp;of the state's plan impacts employees in FTE (full-time equivalent) positions whose
                              work has not or cannot readily continue to be done remotely. Those employees will
                              be back to work first. The state SC Department of Administration will provide guidance
                              regarding when these employees will be returned to work, but it will be no later than
                              June 1, 2020.&nbsp; FTE employees who are not currently able to work from home may expect
                              to hear from their supervisor prior to June 1 regarding the date they should report
                              to their campus workplace.&nbsp; In most cases, employees who are currently working from
                              home will continue to work from home during the first phase of the return to the workplace
                              plan.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p>The&nbsp;<u>Second Phase</u>&nbsp;of the return to the workplace plan will bring more employees back to their regular
                              work location on campus.&nbsp; The date the second phase begins will also be determined
                              based on guidance from the SC Department of Administration.&nbsp; We do know it will be
                              no sooner than two weeks after the begin date of the first phase.&nbsp;
                           </p>
                           
                           <p>We will take all appropriate measures to make employees feel as safe as possible in
                              the workplace upon their return.&nbsp; In addition, employees who are within the higher
                              risk or special populations or who care for someone in the population vulnerable to
                              COVID-19 should discuss their situation with their supervisor. Our Office of Human
                              Resources, Employee Diversity, and Wellness also stands ready to assist employees
                              who are simply not comfortable physically returning to the workplace at this time.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p>The&nbsp;<u>Third Phase</u>&nbsp;has yet to be determined but in essence it will be launched, “on the advice and guidance
                              of DHEC, but at a minimum of two weeks following the start of Phase 2.” At this point,
                              the Third Phase launch is highly dependent on, “the advice of health professionals,
                              the reopening of schools and the widespread availability of child-care options.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p>As we continue our divisional back-to-work planning, we will maintain our emphasis
                              on the health and safety of our faculty and staff. I will share more information on
                              our institutional plans once additional details are finalized. Thank you again for
                              your patience and flexibility during these unusual times.

                           <p>Dear Colleagues:</p>
                           
                           <p>I hope this message finds you and your family healthy and safe. As I was contemplating
                              what updates to bring to you at this time, it occurred to me that when I accepted
                              this interim presidency I could not have imagined what we have now experienced as
                              a campus community, and I certainly would not have believed in this amount of time
                              on the job that I would have met so few of you, as well as so few of our students,
                              alumni, and other constituents.&nbsp;
                           </p>
                           
                           <p>Like many of you, I value the original form of “face time,” handshakes upon meeting,
                              and eye contact when discussing matters of importance. I had a chance to do all those
                              things with some of you in late January and in my first two weeks on campus. Since
                              then, our communication has been limited, but I do hope you have seen, through the
                              various announcements and decisions that have been made, my dedication to this university
                              and its people. I sincerely hope I have begun to earn your trust.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p>Much uncertainly clearly remains on such important questions as when will campus open
                              and will instruction be “in person” rather than remote in the fall. While I cannot
                              answer those questions, I do want to update you on some of what the senior leadership
                              has determined as we await more information from Governor McMaster, DHEC, the CDC,
                              etc.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p><strong>Immediate Updates</strong></p>

                                 follow social distancing guidance.

                                 return to campus.

                              <li>All&nbsp;<strong>on-campus events, external rentals, and sports, academic and arts camps</strong>&nbsp;are cancelled through June 30.&nbsp; Those events planned for after July 1 may still happen,
                                 depending on state and local guidance at that time.

                              <li>The ban on new&nbsp;<strong>non-essential Winthrop business travel</strong>&nbsp;has been extended through June 30. Given projected revenue shortfalls for 2020-21,
                                 it may be necessary to continue the ban into the new fiscal year, so please plan early
                                 to discuss any travel with your department chairs/heads.
                              </li>

                           <p><strong>Summer Plans</strong></p>
                           
                           <p>The health and welfare of our campus community remains at the forefront of decisions
                              we are making to prepare for the day when, by law, we have to open the campus. We
                              already know that day will look nothing like March 13, the last day that faculty and
                              staff were working on campus and students were leaving for Spring Break. So what will
                              be different?
                           </p>
                           
                           <p>Right now we are planning for a phased opening, rather than everyone back in offices
                              and performing their duties on campus immediately. Last week I asked each division
                              to create a task force to address potential issues related to their division for the
                              eventuality of returning to campus.&nbsp; This multilevel exercise will allow divisions
                              to think through how they can apply social distancing guidelines in their work space,
                              what family obligations or health concerns faculty and staff have, and how work responsibilities
                              will be met through, if necessary, a combination of remote and on-site assignments,
                              based on employee needs. This process also requires that divisions adapt their work,
                              if necessary, to support decisions already made (such as plans for Summer Session,
                              virtual Orientation, etc.) and those yet to be determined about other typical summer
                              activities, leading into the fall semester.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p>Based on the divisional feedback received in the next two weeks, and continuing guidance
                              from the Governor’s office, DHEC, and the CDC, I expect we will have an overall plan
                              shortly thereafter for how we will move into the summer months.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p><strong>Fall Scenarios</strong></p>
                           
                           <p>I want you to know that we are doing all that we can to help returning students and
                              new students enroll for the fall semester.&nbsp;In addition to the spring semester reimbursements,
                              the CARES Act funds, and the Student Emergency and Assistance Fund, we also have extended
                              the deadline for housing contracts and allowed students to enroll even if the balance
                              on their accounts is higher than would be expected. &nbsp;&nbsp;
                           </p>
                           
                           <p>Senior leadership will continue to work with areas across campus on scenario planning
                              for the fall. As you may know if you read higher education news stories, institutions
                              across the country are choosing very different paths, from plans to fully open face
                              to face on schedule, to delayed openings, to hybrid semesters starting remotely and
                              moving to campus based if feasible mid semester. We have every intention of welcoming
                              students to the campus in the fall, but we will continue to explore all of our options
                              with an eye toward what is best for Winthrop, our students, and our employees, keeping
                              in mind national and state guidance aimed at keeping our community safe and healthy.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p>What we are certainly hoping for is a commitment from federal and state government
                              to the widespread testing that is necessary to determine COVID-19 incidence in our
                              state and community.&nbsp; This is a major concern of all the presidents to whom I talk
                              on a weekly basis through the CHE. I will continue to press this need with our legislators
                              as well.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p>As you know, much uncertainty remains on the budget situation. We have been ramping
                              up our recruitment efforts, but like other schools, we do not know what to expect
                              for fall enrollment because many families are facing severe economic difficulties.&nbsp;Likewise,
                              we have no idea yet what federal funds we may see from the state or what our appropriation
                              will be. We do know that the Legislature will be reconvening in Columbia next week
                              to take up their continuing resolution. &nbsp;&nbsp;
                           </p>
                           
                           <p>Thank you for all of your efforts over the spring semester. Your Eagle spirit has
                              been on full display, and I truly appreciate your commitment to Winthrop.
                           </p>

                           <p>I hope this message finds you well and relaxing a bit after exams. I mentioned two
                              weeks ago that we expected $5,382,130 to come to our campus from the CARES Act, with
                              half of that amount ($2,691,065) strictly for emergency assistance to students. I
                              am pleased to say we now have access to the emergency student assistance funds and
                              a better idea of how we will be allowed to disburse these funds to our undergraduate
                              and graduate students. &nbsp;
                           </p>
                           
                           <p>The following federal guidance was used to determine eligibility to receive funds:&nbsp;</p>
                           
                           <ul>
                              
                              <li>Only students who filed a FAFSA for the 2019-20 year are eligible; DACA students,
                                 international students, and others who did not file a FAFSA are not eligible.
                              </li>
                              
                              <li>In addition to filing a FAFSA, undergraduates and graduate students must be degree
                                 seeking and have been enrolled through the end of the Spring 2020 semester; three
                                 exceptions to the degree-seeking requirement at Winthrop are Counseling and Development
                                 Certificate, Dietetics Internship, and Winthrop Think College.
                              </li>
                              
                              <li>Per Department of Education guidance, graduate students must be enrolled in campus-based
                                 programs; therefore, those enrolled in Winthrop’s 100% online programs are not eligible
                                 for this funding.
                              </li>
                              
                           </ul>
                           
                           <p>Based on the above, 3,835 students are eligible for emergency assistance. For Pell-eligible
                              undergraduates, the amount of the assistance will be $750 per student. Non-Pell-eligible
                              undergraduates will receive $550, the same amount that will go to eligible graduate
                              students. These emergency assistance grants are being disbursed directly to students
                              regardless of their account balances with the university. These funds have been processed,
                              and direct deposits/checks will be distributed later this week.&nbsp;
                           </p>
                           
                           <p><strong>Students who have not graduated, who did not file a FAFSA, but had expenses related
                                 to COVID-19, and wish to file a FAFSA before June 30, 2020, may do so and submit a
                                 CARES appeal for consideration.&nbsp; Submitting a FAFSA/appeal does not guarantee funding.</strong></p>
                           
                           <p>Students should contact the&nbsp;<a title="Financial Aid Office" href="mailto:finaid@winthrop.edu">Financial Aid Office</a>&nbsp;if they have questions about their eligibility for CARES Act emergency funds or to
                              inquire about submitting a FAFSA or about the appeal process.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p>As to the other half of the federal CARES Act funding, we have applied for it and
                              await access to the funds. We intend for the money to be used to cover some of our
                              COVID-19 costs, such as technology to support on-line instruction and employees working
                              from home; facilities cleaning aligned with CDC guidelines; and campus security, among
                              others.&nbsp;
                           </p>
                           
                           <p>We know COVID-19 has stretched the finances of many of our students and their families,
                              and it is my sincere hope that the funds distributed today, as well as the room, board
                              and parking reimbursements already applied to student accounts and distributed, will
                              help those impacted get by until the economy improves. As we continue to learn more
                              about additional federal and state funds related to COVID-19, I will keep you apprised.
                              Thank you for your patience.

                           <p>As remote learning and exams conclude this week, I believe&nbsp;a collective sigh of relief
                              is in order for the campus community. Truly, you have all accomplished what some might
                              have thought impossible over the last half of the spring semester. As we pivoted to
                              (for most of us) a totally new mode of teaching, learning, and working in response
                              to COVID-19, we were stretched in unimaginable ways, yet succeeded in making it through
                              this most unusual set of circumstances.&nbsp;Congratulations&nbsp;and well done! I am proud
                              to be your interim president.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p>We have received many questions in recent days about the status of Commencement. As
                              I shared previously, the Commencement Committee was tasked to recommend to senior
                              leadership options for how we might appropriately recognize and celebrate our graduates.
                              The group considered feedback members received about hosting a virtual ceremony this
                              month, but ultimately chose to recommend a more traditional in-person event reflecting
                              the desires of our graduates. I ask you to save the date for Winthrop University’s
                              Commencement on Saturday, August 15, 2020.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p>This was not an easy decision as there remains much uncertainty about where we will
                              be as a state and a nation in three months’ time. However, the committee and senior
                              leadership felt strongly that students' Winthrop experiences should not end without
                              appropriate recognition and celebration. Therefore, we will remain hopeful about the
                              status of gatherings in mid-August and will share more details as we move forward
                              with our plans.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p>In the meantime, this week remains an important milestone, and we have a robust plan
                              to celebrate and inspire our graduates through social media and our website. All of
                              our official Winthrop social media channels will have posts and information on the
                              accomplishments of the Winthrop community, and a new website will debut on Saturday,
                              May 9, when undergraduate Commencement was scheduled to take place. I encourage you
                              to visit these virtual places to see and read about all that is happening during what
                              remains a time of reflection and celebration. Graduates should watch their email for
                              details from Records and Registration about posting of degrees, receipt of diplomas,
                              and other logistics.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p>Among the highlights of Commencement is the announcement of faculty award winners,
                              and I would like to direct your attention to our&nbsp;<a title="news release" href="/news-events/winthrop-celebrates-top-faculty-award-winners.aspx">news release</a>&nbsp;with details regarding our three deserving recipients: Brad Witzel, professor of
                              education and program director of special education (Distinguished Professor Award);
                              Crystal Glover, assistant professor in the Department of Curriculum and Pedagogy (Outstanding
                              Junior Professor); and Adriana Cordis, associate professor of accounting (LaRoche
                              Graduate Faculty Award). I commend these faculty members and thank them for their
                              excellent, student-centered work.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p>As we prepare to conclude Winthrop’s 134th&nbsp;academic year this summer, I once again
                              thank you for your patience and resilience as we continue to navigate uncharted waters.
                              It is my sincere hope to safely see you all on campus August 15, and I certainly look
                              forward to what will be a memorable celebration worthy of the accomplishments of the
                              Class of 2020 and the community that has steadfastly supported these graduates.

                           <p>Dear Colleagues:</p>
                           
                           <p>The first of May, traditionally known as May Day, is often a time of celebration of
                              the arrival of spring. I understand there was at Winthrop an annual May Day Celebration
                              begun in 1929 and popular throughout the institution's years as a women's college.
                              For us, May 1, 2020, will be a cause for celebration of another sort – surviving our
                              seventh (can you believe it?) week away from campus! It is hard to imagine, but another
                              month of working remotely has begun, and it is a good time to review how Winthrop
                              is following appropriate guidelines for the health and safety of our campus community.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p>As you know, the campus is closed until further notice due to the COVID-19 pandemic.&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong><em>At this time, only employees who have been approved to work on campus based on the
                                    essential nature of their jobs are allowed to be working on campus. &nbsp;Other employees
                                    may be approved to briefly come to campus to retrieve items, but in these very limited
                                    situations, approval must be obtained from the divisional vice president or the provost.</em>&nbsp;</strong></p>
                           
                           <p>It is vitally important that we know who has been on campus and when/where they were.&nbsp;
                              I expect any employee who comes to campus to be respectful of others and practice
                              recommended guidelines for the health, safety, and comfort-level of the entire campus
                              community, but especially for those employees who may have no other choice but to
                              report to work.&nbsp; To the extent we can, we want to take all appropriate measures to
                              prevent the potential spread of the virus.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p>To that end, while on campus, all employees must adhere to the following requirements
                              that align with the guidelines published by the&nbsp;<a title="Centers for Disease Control (CDC)" href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/prevention.html" target="_blank">Centers for Disease Control (CDC)</a>.

                                    in a private office.</strong>&nbsp; Specifically, face masks must be worn when the employee leaves their private work
                                 space and when interacting with coworkers.&nbsp; Winthrop's supply of face masks is very
                                 limited.&nbsp; Currently Winthrop is supplying face masks for facilities employees based
                                 on CDC guidelines for employees in certain professions.&nbsp; All other employees are required
                                 to wear face masks and to follow the CDC guidelines for the proper&nbsp;<a title="use, care, cleaning, and disposal of face masks." href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/diy-cloth-face-coverings.html" target="_blank">use, care, cleaning, and disposal of face masks.&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;Winthrop has ordered additional face masks, and employees will be notified when/if

                                             important after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing; going into the bathroom;
                                             and before eating or preparing food.

                                             with at least 60% alcohol, covering all surfaces of your hands and rubbing them together
                                             until they feel dry.

                                          <li>There is not a strong recommendation from the CDC that wearing gloves is necessary
                                             while at work (other than for certain facilities employees and for healthcare workers).&nbsp;
                                             However, wearing gloves may provide employees with an additional level of comfort
                                             with regard to exposure.&nbsp; So, while wearing gloves is not a requirement, employees
                                             may do so at their own discretion.

                                 able to provide a list of individuals with whom the employee was in close contact
                                 with and a list of individuals with whom the employee was in the vicinity of (interaction
                                 with, but does not meet the definition of “close contact”) while working on campus.&nbsp;
                                 This information will be used to notify others if the employee either suspects they
                                 have been exposed to or has tested positive for COVID-19, and it will be requested
                                 only if the need arises.

                           <p>I think you will agree that these requirements are the least we can do as a campus
                              community that cares about and values each member. I personally appreciate the attention
                              you will pay to following these requirements if you have to be on campus for any reason.
                              If you have questions or concerns about these expectations, please let me know. Thank
                              you for all you are doing for Winthrop during difficult times!

                           <p>Dear Students,</p>
                           
                           <p>I hope you and your families are well. I am writing to give you an update on a couple
                              of important matters.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p>First, I am pleased to share information on housing, dining and parking fee adjustments.
                              Thanks to the good work of a team of individuals from residence life, finance, information
                              technology, and financial aid, fee adjustments were made to impacted student accounts
                              last week. As mentioned previously, some fee adjustments would result in a credit
                              to students' accounts if they owed the university, while other fee adjustments would
                              result in a refund if students' accounts were current.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p>The process provided $3.7 million in fee adjustments to student accounts and impacted
                              2,960 students. You may read more about the process in this&nbsp;<u><a title="/news-events/winthrop-returns-3.7-million-in-housing-dining-and-parking-fees-to-students.aspx" href="/news-events/winthrop-returns-3.7-million-in-housing-dining-and-parking-fees-to-students.aspx">news release</a></u>.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p>Secondly, I want to share with you what we know so far about the CARES Act and state
                              funding and what that funding will mean for Winthrop.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p>When the initial Department of Education guidance on CARES came out on April 9, we
                              learned the amount our institution could expect ($5,382,130) with half of that amount
                              ($2,691,065) strictly going toward emergency assistance to students. We are still
                              awaiting clarity about how we will be allowed to disperse these funds, but we know
                              that this assistance must be provided to degree-seeking students, both graduate and
                              undergraduate, enrolled this spring. We submitted our certificate of funding agreement
                              to the Department of Education last week, and we are waiting for access to the funds.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p>We know our students have been impacted in truly unimaginable ways. Hopefully these
                              resources will abate some of the financial stress associated with COVID-19. Conversations
                              among senior leadership have focused on the most equitable and fastest way to distribute
                              these funds. &nbsp;We have a plan based on undergraduate students receiving funds based
                              on their status as Pell-eligible or non-Pell-eligible, per the limited Department
                              of Education guidance received. Graduate students also will receive funds.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p>As to the other half of the funding, it is to be used to cover COVID-19 costs, but
                              again we have no specifics. We eagerly await more guidance here.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p>States also are receiving funds through CARES, and we know that any state-allocated
                              funds will be distributed at Governor Henry McMaster's discretion to higher education
                              institutions (public and private). We have no information yet on any of these funds
                              and how they may impact us.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p>I wish that I had more details to share with you. I will continue to provide information
                              as we receive it and make decisions at the senior leadership level in coordination
                              with the Board of Trustees.
                           </p>

                              and undergraduate, enrolled this spring. We submitted our certificate of funding agreement
                              to the Department of Education last week, and we are waiting for access to the funds.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p>Our students have been impacted in truly unimaginable ways. Hopefully these resources
                              will abate some of their financial stress. Conversations among senior leadership have
                              focused on the most equitable and fastest way to distribute these funds. &nbsp;We have
                              a plan based on undergraduate students receiving funds based on their status as Pell-eligible
                              or non-Pell-eligible, per the limited Department of Education guidance received. Graduate
                              students also will receive funds.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p>As to the other half of the funding, it is to be used to cover COVID-19 costs, but
                              again we have no specifics. We know that some capital and pre-recruitment activities
                              are excluded, and that there is an expectation, but not a requirement, for maintaining
                              payroll. We eagerly await more guidance here.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p>States also are receiving funds through CARES, and we know that any state-allocated
                              funds will be distributed at Governor Henry McMaster’s discretion to higher education
                              institutions (public and private). We have no information yet on any of these funds
                              and how they may impact us.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p>Finally, on the state government front, we know that the legislature met in Columbia
                              week before last in a hastily called meeting where the House and Senate were expected
                              to vote on legislation to keep state government operating at this year’s spending
                              levels and to set a date for when they would return to pass a budget for next fiscal
                              year. Tied to that legislation was a spending proposal that set aside $200 million
                              for emergency COVID-19 spending and gave the governor wide power in directing funds.
                              The proposal also allowed state agencies, including colleges and universities, the
                              flexibility to furlough employees if their budgets get out of balance due to revenue
                              shortfalls stemming from the pandemic.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p>Unfortunately, the full General Assembly failed to adopt those measures, leaving uncertainties
                              on next steps and when the body would again meet. Late last week Governor McMaster
                              offered to call lawmakers back to work on a day of their choosing after coronavirus
                              cases are expected to peak sometime next month. It is unclear at this time whether
                              the legislators will take him up on that offer. So, on the state government front,
                              we continue to watch and wait.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p>At this point in time, I want to note that it is not our intention to consider employing
                              furloughs until their use is approved by the legislature and only if they are necessary.
                              Based on Governor McMaster's communication to the legislature and our intention to
                              use furloughs as a last resort, it would seem reasonable to conclude the decision
                              whether to employ furloughs because of our budget circumstances is likely to be made
                              later in the spring or even sometime this summer. With regard to returning to work
                              on campus, we await guidance from the Governor's office. However, in anticipation
                              of returning to work on campus at some point, please be assured that we are developing
                              a policy on working from home to accommodate employees who will need to continue to
                              work remotely due to family obligations or health concerns.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p>I know these last few items are top of mind, and I wish that I had more details to
                              share with you. I will continue to provide information as we receive it and make decisions
                              at the senior leadership level in coordination with the Board of Trustees.
                           </p>

                           <p>The needs of Winthrop students are rapidly changing&nbsp;in the wake of&nbsp;COVID-19&nbsp;and many
                              are dealing with&nbsp;unexpected&nbsp;financial hardships.&nbsp;In response,&nbsp;Winthrop has created
                              the Student Emergency &amp; Assistance Fund&nbsp;to&nbsp;help students&nbsp;who are faced with difficulties&nbsp;during
                              this unique time.&nbsp;
                           </p>
                           
                           <p>The campus community has already shown a&nbsp;strong commitment to accommodating student
                              needs and expectations, and I thank you for doing your part.&nbsp;Now there is an even
                              greater need for students juggling&nbsp;issues with&nbsp;housing&nbsp;and moving expenses,&nbsp;food insecurities,
                              transportation, resources required for remote learning,&nbsp;and&nbsp;other related basic needs.&nbsp;
                           </p>
                           
                           <p>Many faculty, staff and community members had already&nbsp;expressed&nbsp;interest in how they
                              could provide support to students. This newly created fund will provide the opportunity
                              for us to contribute any monetary level of support that will&nbsp;quickly support those
                              students who have been adversely affected by the campus closure and the transition
                              to remote learning.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p>In my short time here I’ve been amazed at how everyone has come together to ensure
                              that our students remain our top priority. The speed with which this fund was created
                              is yet another example of how the Winthrop community always stands ready to help our
                              own.&nbsp;I am grateful for how you have shown up for our students&nbsp;amid the COVID-19 crisis.

                           <p>Dear Students,</p>
                           
                           <p>Thank you for your patience over these last few weeks as we have grappled with the
                              COVID-19-related closing of campus and how to proceed with fee reductions and refunds
                              related to moving to remote instruction for the remainder of spring 2020. While this
                              is a more complex matter than many may have anticipated, we have worked with the Commission
                              on Higher Education and other state institutions to help determine our response, and
                              today we presented our recommendations to the Board of Trustees.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p>The&nbsp;<a title="press release" href="/news-events/coronavirus-impact-on-winthrop-in-the-millions-board-told.aspx">press release</a>&nbsp;that is posted on our website explains next steps, and I encourage you to read it
                              closely. Each student’s individual account will be reviewed and fee adjustments will
                              be made according the residence hall and meal plan they chose.&nbsp; Unused Cafe Cash will
                              be returned.&nbsp; All students who purchased a parking permit will receive a fee adjustment.&nbsp;
                              The date for proration of fees is March 23, 2020. Adjustments will begin this month
                              and are expected to take some time as individual attention must be given to each student.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p>It is important to note that monies due as a result of fee adjustments will first
                              be applied to any unpaid bills in your account.&nbsp; If you are paid in full, then you
                              will receive a cash refund.&nbsp; If you still owe Winthrop any monies, the amount due
                              will be subtracted before any cash is refunded via direct deposit or by check to the
                              address on record.&nbsp; You should review your contact information in Wingspan immediately

                           <p>Additional information went to faculty/staff today about the necessary budget and
                              hiring freeze that trustees approved in order to help facilitate the reduction in
                              fees and refunds that will soon begin reaching students’ accounts.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p>We know that these are unimaginably difficult times for some students and their families.
                              It also is a truly unprecedented situation for colleges and universities. Earlier
                              this week the Board of Trustees voted unanimously to implement a reduced rate for
                              Summer Session 2020 classes. The university’s summer offerings for in-state students
                              already reflect a 20 percent discount as compared to fall and spring tuition. The
                              board’s action provides an additional 12 percent discount for all regular classes
                              offered this summer only. Read more about the reduction in this&nbsp;<a title="press release" href="/news-events/Winthrop-board-of-trustees-votes-to-reduce-summer-tuition.aspx">press release</a>&nbsp;if you are considering taking classes this summer.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p>We want you to be able to continue on your educational journey with a focus on timely
                              degree completion. The decisions we have made in terms of reductions in fees, refunds,
                              and summer tuition all are made with our students’ progress toward their degrees in
                              mind.

                              with you, and I wanted to reach out today with news of how the university will handle
                              reduction in fees and reimbursements to student accounts. Details may be found in

                           <p>As I have mentioned to news outlets I have spoken with, we have been working with
                              our peer institutions across the state and with the S.C. Commission on Higher Education
                              on guiding principles on how best to address this topic. Today, our Board of Trustees
                              granted approval to begin the process of reduction in fees/reimbursements, and while
                              it will be a time-intensive process because of the need to review each student’s account,
                              funds should begin going out this month.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p>I appreciate your continued patience.</p>

                           <p>I never could have imagined less than a month into my interim presidency that Winthrop
                              and the world would be facing such an unprecedented disruption to our way of life
                              due to COVID-19. But I'm still so glad to be here, watching everyone band together
                              more than ever to continue delivering a retooled Winthrop experience for our students.&nbsp;
                           </p>
                           
                           <p>The tenacious Winthrop spirit that I have heard so much about has been front and center,
                              and I'm thankful for each person's flexibility and perseverance as we navigate these
                              new and challenging times together.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p>I wanted to update you on a couple things below:</p>
                           
                           <p><strong>Latest COVID-19 Information:</strong></p>
                           
                           <p>As you are aware, most all students have moved out of the residence halls and we are
                              holding all classes remotely. Some essential personnel are physically on campus, but
                              most faculty and staff are working remotely from home (as am I!)
                           </p>
                           
                           <p>I applaud each of you who worked quickly and diligently to move all academic instruction
                              to a remote learning format. This is no small feat. As we start our second week of
                              remote learning, our students have embraced these changes and continue learning and
                              working toward their goals. Staff members continue supporting our students in all
                              capacities, reinforcing that their learning, safety and health remain our top priorities.
                              Our Admissions team is diligently working, and thinking, outside of the box to continue
                              recruiting our incoming freshman class.

                           <p>All university-sponsored on- and off-campus events are cancelled or postponed through
                              May 9, including all spring Commencement ceremonies. As I noted in an earlier email,
                              we will find a way to appropriately celebrate our graduates when we feel it is safe
                              to do so.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p>For now, I encourage you to keep monitoring your email and the university's&nbsp;<a title="https://www.winthrop.edu/emergency/coronavirus.aspx" href="/emergency/coronavirus.aspx">COVID-19 website</a>.

                           <p><strong>Board of Trustees Action on Summer Session&nbsp;</strong></p>
                           
                           <p>Yesterday, the&nbsp;Winthrop University Board of Trustees voted unanimously to implement
                              a reduced rate for 2020 Summer Session classes. The university’s summer offerings
                              for in-state students already reflect a 20 percent discount as compared to fall and
                              spring tuition. The board's action will provide an additional 12 percent discount
                              for all regular classes offered this summer only.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p>I applaud and appreciate our trustees’ leadership in recognizing that our students
                              may be facing financial hardships brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic. By reducing
                              summer session tuition, we are able to facilitate our students continuing on their
                              educational journeys with a focus on timely degree completion.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p>Trustees also approved the Division of Academic Affairs' recommendation&nbsp;that Maymester
                              (May 18-June 5) and sessions that are set to begin June 8 (B and C sessions) be totally
                              online, with any classes that require on-campus meetings to be scheduled for the final
                              Summer Session July 13-Aug. 12 (D session).&nbsp;Getting these plans in place now will
                              allow faculty and staff the time to prepare accordingly. You may read more about these
                              actions in this&nbsp;<u><a title="press release" href="/news-events/Winthrop-board-of-trustees-votes-to-reduce-summer-tuition.aspx">press release</a></u>.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p>Thank you again for all of your hard work throughout this month. I don't think any
                              of us envisioned how this spring semester would play out, but together, I know that
                              we will get through this. The Winthrop community is better together, and although
                              we are physically separated right now we will emerge from this stronger than ever.

                           <p>Winthrop University was informed today (March 23) that a resident student who stopped
                              by a Winthrop residence hall on March 17 to pick up belongings during spring break
                              has tested positive for COVID-19. This student followed the protocol of the S.C. Department
                              of Health and Environmental Control and upon showing symptoms of the virus, sought
                              medical advice and testing where s/he permanently resides.&nbsp;
                           </p>
                           
                           <p>While the resident was on campus for only a short time, precautions have been&nbsp;taken
                              in the hall&nbsp;to sanitize shared space and frequently touched surfaces. These&nbsp;preventive
                              measures will minimize the risk posed to other residents and the campus community.&nbsp;Others
                              who may have come into close contact with the individual who tested positive are being
                              notified of possible exposure.&nbsp;
                           </p>
                           
                           <p>This student is receiving the full support of the university during this difficult
                              time. It is important to note that our Winthrop community will likely continue to
                              be directly and indirectly impacted by this unprecedented public health crisis in
                              coming days and weeks. The university does not intend to publicly announce each additional
                              case, but we must remain vigilant in reinforcing the message that no one is immune
                              to COVID-19 that we all must do our part to slow the spread of the virus.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p>That commitment is further reflected in our announcement today of the process by which
                              resident students may return to campus to pick up belongings this week. The staggered
                              sign-up process we will employ underscores the requirement for social distancing with
                              which we must abide so that we have limited numbers of students in the halls.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p>Our recent decision to close campus for the remainder of the semester is in keeping
                              with the advice of public health experts to maximize such social distancing. We strongly
                              encourage everyone in our community to please take the necessary precautions to keep
                              themselves and their loved ones safe: maintain social distance, practice good hygiene
                              by observing respiratory etiquette and washing your hands frequently, continually
                              monitor your health, reach out to your health care provider if needed, and self-quarantine
                              if you develop symptoms.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p>Thank you for your understanding and patience as we navigate this latest development

                           <p>&nbsp;</p>
                           
                           <p>I understand that our Student Affairs division has been sharing information with all
                              of you so that you, too, may remain informed as we share information about remote
                              learning and other topics with your student. Today I would like to reassure you of
                              plans to keep teaching and learning moving forward, as well as ensuring the safety
                              and health of our campus community. As you may know, with the Governor’s directive
                              yesterday, we will be extending remote instruction through the end of the semester
                              and have postponed our May commencement ceremonies.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p>&nbsp;</p>
                           
                           <p><strong>Academic Affairs Updates</strong></p>
                           
                           <p>First, we are committed to completing this semester and ensuring our graduating students
                              meet their requirements for graduation. Our talented faculty and academic support
                              staff have been working overtime to prepare for the shift to remote instruction beginning
                              Monday, March 23, and ensure our students continue to receive high quality learning
                              experiences.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p>&nbsp;</p>
                           
                           <p>We know our students are concerned about their ability to complete their work this
                              semester. Please reassure them that the remote instruction preparations underway will
                              give them a pathway to complete all coursework and get full credit for courses this
                              semester. Where adjustments have to be made, faculty are at work making those adjustments.
                              If students have specific concerns about the transition to remote instruction, please
                              encourage them to reach out to their faculty. They are the front line of academic
                              support. For international students returning to their home countries, faculty are
                              prepared to work with them to complete all coursework remotely as well.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p>&nbsp;</p>
                           
                           <p>Advising sessions for fall 2020 registration also will happen remotely, so our faculty
                              and staff are working to make sure we have processes in place to support that important
                              work as well. Parents and extended family can partner with us in this regard by encouraging
                              students to keep checking their email and texts, look for communications from advisors
                              as well as faculty, and be prepared to discuss degree progress and completion plans.
                              We are committed to doing everything we can to ensure that our students all make steady
                              progress toward their goals.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p>&nbsp;</p>
                           
                           <p>Finally, we know that many students are concerned about completing their cultural
                              events credits for the semester. For seniors graduating in May and August 2020, all
                              remaining cultural events credits will be waived, as long as all other degree requirements
                              are met. For non-graduating students, they will have ample time in the future to work
                              on this degree requirement.&nbsp;
                           </p>
                           
                           <p>&nbsp;</p>
                           
                           <p><strong>Student Affairs Updates</strong></p>
                           
                           <p>Secondly, we have taken steps to limit the number of individuals on campus and thus
                              the potential for COVID-19 spread. We have closed the residence halls to all students
                              but those with severely extenuating circumstances. Our Dining Services staff will
                              provide pick-up meals to students remaining with us. Our on-campus dining locations
                              are closed.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p>To ensure that students receive appropriate support during this stressful time, the

                              eventual return.&nbsp;All internal and external events have been cancelled for the immediate
                              future.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p>&nbsp;</p>
                           
                           <p>Finally, we know financial concerns are paramount to many of you. I am working with
                              the university’s Board of Trustees and senior leadership to provide answers as soon
                              as possible. All decisions on refunds, credits, commencement and other concerns will
                              be communicated to students and parents as soon as possible.&nbsp;

                           <p>The COVID-19 situation remains very fluid. These are challenging and unprecedented
                              times. Please do not hesitate to reach out using the links and contacts above if you
                              have specific questions or needs&nbsp;with regard to&nbsp;your student.&nbsp;Thank you for the patience
                              you have shown as we work through extraordinary circumstances and do our part to reduce
                              the spread of this virus. Nothing is more important than the safety and well-being
                              of our students.&nbsp;Thank you for entrusting them to our care.

                        <ol class="noindent fyNoShow" id="d12e1379" type="A">
                           
                           <p>Per Governor McMaster’s update earlier today, Winthrop University will extend our
                              move to remote instruction for all courses for the remainder of this semester. In
                              this way, all students will have the opportunity to complete their spring 2020 courses
                              while maintaining safe and healthy precautions against COVID-19. Despite it being
                              challenging, Winthrop’s strength is our family-like concern for each other and our
                              tradition of delivering a student-centered experience.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p>The move to remote instruction may create new and unexpected difficulties, but we
                              will face them together. Our talented faculty and staff are working diligently to
                              accommodate student needs and expectations. Faculty, staff, and students should continue
                              to monitor email and our website for information regarding when residence halls will
                              be open for retrieving belongings, access to technology while away from campus, decisions
                              about student refunds and/or credits, and other important updates.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p>We know our seniors and graduate students are faced with unprecedented events that
                              are taking away from what should be a joyous time as they conclude their academic
                              career at Winthrop. Because of that, we will postpone our spring commencement ceremonies.
                              Although these circumstances are beyond our control, we can assure our students that
                              their Winthrop experience will not end without recognizing and celebrating that they
                              will be Winthrop graduates. At this time, we cannot say when or how commencement will
                              happen, but we will rejoice in their accomplishments and honor our graduates in a
                              way and time that is safe to do so.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p>Thank you for your hard work, understanding, and continued patience as we move forward
                              in these uncertain times.

                           <p>I write to you to provide an update as to the recommendations I have now received
                              from Winthrop's Critical Incident Management Team.&nbsp; Based on their recommendations
                              and my judgement as to our rapidly evolving situation, I am providing this update
                              as a follow up to our communication yesterday regarding Governor Henry McMaster's
                              announcement of the closure of all S.C. public universities through the end of March.
                           </p>

                              <li>Guidance received from the Commission on Higher Education indicates that colleges
                                 and universities have some flexibility to continue online or remote coursework moving
                                 forward and to make some decisions on how we might serve (using essential personnel
                                 only) those students who must remain on campus.
                              </li>

                              <li>In general, faculty, staff and students should STAY AWAY from campus until instructed
                                 otherwise. Our president and senior administrators are leading by example by cancelling
                                 all face-to-face appointments and conducting business by phone whenever possible.
                                 It is imperative to the health and safety of our campus community for non-essential
                                 personnel to STAY AWAY from campus at this time. For those who may be instructed to
                                 work from home, we are designating five hours tomorrow (Tuesday 10:00 a.m. to 3:00
                                 p.m.) for employees to pick up materials and other items needed to work from home.

                                 management, police, housing, environmental health &amp; safety and other employees who
                                 have been contacted by supervisors.&nbsp;&nbsp;All other personnel should remain at home and
                                 contact their supervisor for further direction on work expectations.&nbsp;
                              </li>

                              <li>As of now, a decision has not been communicated from the Governor’s office regarding
                                 whether Winthrop will be authorized to apply leave with pay for leave-eligible employees
                                 for the time the Governor has ordered the university closed.&nbsp;&nbsp;Unless the federal or
                                 state government takes additional action, employees in non-leave earning positions
                                 (temporary and student employees) will be in unpaid status for this time unless they
                                 are in one of the “essential” areas and actually work.&nbsp;&nbsp;We are hoping to hear more
                                 information from the Governor’s office soon about how leave-eligible employees should
                                 report their time on timesheets and leave reports.&nbsp;&nbsp;HR will provide additional information
                                 prior to March 31, 2020.

                                 in Academic Affairs have the supports they need to make this transition to remote
                                 instruction in addition to working from home. Faculty who require training through
                                 the WOOL office are able to accomplish this remotely through resources provided on

                              additional clarification on how the closure will impact instructional plans we put

                              and others who may be contacted by their supervisors should report to work.

                           <p>We are shifting our COVID-19 campus response as new information is coming quickly
                              and the ability to be nimble is what we have been working toward for several weeks.
                              I am pleased that our vice presidents and unit leaders are following recommendations
                              from the CDC, DHEC, and their professional associations, as well as modeling plans
                              from peer institutions as we learn of them. As a result of widespread campus consultation
                              in the last few days, primarily through leadership in the academic and student affairs
                              divisions, Winthrop’s senior leadership has new recommendations. Based on their recommendations
                              and on further due considerations, I am informing you of the following.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p><strong>Changes to Instructional Delivery Post-Spring Break</strong></p>
                           
                           <p>Out of an abundance of caution, we will move to remote instruction for March 23-April
                              3, which are the two weeks following Spring Break. To prepare for this shift, faculty
                              will start now preparing for delivery of remote instruction, and their efforts will
                              continue March 16-20, while students are away on the break. The Academic Affairs division
                              has been working on this for the last two weeks, and Winthrop’s Office of Online Learning
                              has prepared a <a href="/onlinelearning/continuity-of-instruction.aspx">Continuity of Instruction (COI) website</a> to support this effort. It is important to note that despite this shift to remote
                              instruction, <strong>all university offices will remain open and staffed until further notice.</strong> The work of this fine university must continue so students will receive the full
                              advantage of the Winthrop experience!
                           </p>
                           
                           <p><strong>Residence Halls and Dining Services</strong></p>
                           
                           <p>Understandably, the above action should decrease the number of students who are residing
                              on campus which, in turn, will decrease the chance of COVID-19 exposure to our campus
                              community. &nbsp;Students traveling home for break should stay home during the two-week
                              remote instructional period, while international students and other populations with
                              specific needs will be accommodated on a case-by-case basis. In general, there will
                              limited access during this two-week period, March 23-April 3, for students to enjoy
                              the full range of residential and dining services to which they are accustomed. But
                              more on that will come from the Division of Student Affairs as details are determined.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p><strong>Recall of Students Studying Abroad</strong></p>
                           
                           <p>With President Trump’s directive last night that travel into the U.S. from a large
                              number of European countries will tighten considerably for the next month, it is prudent
                              for us to recall from those countries. While we have been in regular contact with
                              them and know they are enjoying their experiences, there remains too much uncertainty
                              in international travel for us to allow them to continue their experiences. We are
                              committed to assisting them on their return, and those wheels already are in motion.
                              We will continue to monitor all of our students abroad and take action as appropriate.
                              &nbsp;
                           </p>
                           
                           <p><strong>Travel During and After Spring Break</strong></p>
                           
                           <p>As we have noted, we recognize that some members of the Winthrop community will be
                              traveling over the break. Per earlier information shared, Winthrop is&nbsp;<strong>prohibiting university business travel</strong>&nbsp;through the end of April to international destinations designated by the CDC as&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/index.html" target="_blank">travel warning level 3 or highe</a>r and strongly encouraging our community members to avoid non-essential domestic travel
                              to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-in-us.html" target="_blank">areas</a>&nbsp;where COVID-19 cases have been identified. Again, out of an abundance of caution,
                              Winthrop’s senior leadership has decided that&nbsp;<strong>no new non-essential Winthrop business travel will be approved</strong>&nbsp;through April 30, 2020. Faculty and staff should not make new, work related travel
                              plans during this period.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p><strong>University Events</strong></p>
                           
                           <p>Until further notice, all university-sponsored events scheduled between <strong>Sunday, March 15 and Friday, April 3</strong> are cancelled, and alternative options for holding or rescheduling events in key
                              areas are being considered. Of note, we have decided that our athletics events will
                              follow recommendations and guidance from the NCAA. Student-athletes should look to
                              their coaches for the latest details on games and events.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p><strong>Health Information and COVID-19 Case Response Planning</strong></p>
                           
                           <p>The Critical Incident Management Team and its sub-groups have been meeting daily to
                              prepare for possible spread of COVID-19 to the Winthrop campus. Guidance on prevention,
                              screening, self-quarantine and more has been communicated via email and uploaded to
                              our COVID-19 information page. Of note most recently, Health and Counseling Services,
                              803/323-2206, will move to telephone triage for responding to health issues after
                              the break, and will do the same for tele-mental health, as appropriate. This ensures
                              the high level of service students have come to expect, while at the same time protecting
                              our front-line health care professionals.

                              the best interests of students and the university. As you can imagine, there are many
                              moving parts here, and the situation is changing rapidly. It would be helpful for
                              you to direct your questions to the respective divisional offices, or you may reach
                              out to me at <a href="mailto:president@winthrop.edu">president@winthrop.edu</a>. &nbsp;Please know that at the forefront of any institutional decisions are your health
                              and safety.

                           </p>
                           
                           <p>Winthrop’s spring break is March 16-20, 2020. We continue to monitor the spread of
                              COVID-19 internationally, domestically and locally and rely on guidance from the Centers
                              for Disease Control (<a title="CDC" href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html">CDC</a>)&nbsp;and the Department of Health and Environmental Control (<a href="https://www.scdhec.gov/health/infectious-diseases/viruses/coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19" target="_blank">DHEC</a>).&nbsp;
                           </p>
                           
                           <p>Most Winthrop students will not be on campus for spring break, but all students need
                              to be proactive in considering how the possibility of changing circumstances could
                              impact Winthrop and, therefore, students’ ability to return to campus after the spring
                              break. Think through what you should take when you leave this week in case you cannot
                              return to campus for any reason on March 22. This includes medical, academic, financial
                              and personal needs. Take your books, laptop and other items you may need to study
                              from home. Check your email and the <a href="/emergency/coronavirus.aspx">website</a> for any institutional updates since they may have an impact on your plans.&nbsp;

                           <p>Some members of the Winthrop community will be traveling over the break. Per earlier
                              information shared, Winthrop is <strong>prohibiting university business travel through April 30, 2020,</strong> to international destinations designated by the CDC as <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/index.html" target="_blank">travel warning level 3 or highe</a>r and strongly encouraging our community members to avoid non-essential domestic travel
                              to <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-in-us.html" target="_blank">areas</a> where COVID-19 cases have been identified.&nbsp;
                           </p>
                           
                           <p>Furthermore, Winthrop’s senior leadership has decided that <strong>no new non-essential Winthrop business travel will be approved</strong> <strong>through April 30, 2020</strong>. Faculty and staff should not make new travel plans during this period even for future
                              dates. The university will continue to monitor the spread of COVID-19 and its impact
                              on travel.&nbsp;&nbsp;

                              and documentation of your travel may be required upon your return to campus.&nbsp;&nbsp;

                           <p>Winthrop is actively monitoring communications from the Centers for Disease Control
                              and Prevention (CDC) and World Health Organization (WHO) for updated information and
                              guidance. Winthrop officials are in contact with our international students on campus
                              and those Winthrop students who are currently studying abroad. We want to ensure that
                              all of our students are safe and healthy, wherever they may be in the world.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p>As of 3/2/2020, the CDC is recommending that institutions of higher education should
                              ‘consider postponing or canceling upcoming student foreign exchange programs and consider
                              asking current program participants to return to their home country.’ In terms of
                              study abroad programs, Winthrop continues to closely monitor the situation including
                              (but not limited to) information obtained from the U.S. Department of State, as well
                              as various news and media networks from around the world. The health and safety of
                              Winthrop students, faculty, and staff remain our top priority and will play a significant
                              role in any decisions made regarding current and upcoming study abroad opportunities
                              and/or faculty led programs to international destinations.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p>Additionally, Winthrop officials are preparing contingency plans for academic programs
                              and campus operations pending COVID-19 expansion in our region. Until further notice,
                              Winthrop asks students and employees who choose to travel to countries identified
                              by the U.S. State Department as a Level 3 or Level 4 threat, to self-quarantine for
                              at least 14 days upon returning to the United States.

                                       are unable to work, including work-from-home, as a result of having to care for a

                              work-from-home, as a result of COVID-19.&nbsp; As directed by Governor Henry McMaster in
                              his executive orders, supervisors should still first offer work-from-home opportunities
                              to employees to the maximum extent possible.&nbsp; Paid leave under the FFCRA will only
                              be available to employees when work-from-home opportunities are not available.
                           </p>

                              do not earn other forms of leave.&nbsp; This includes temporary employees and student employees.&nbsp;
                              Employees are eligible to take leave under the EFMLA if they have been employed at
                              least 30 calendar days.&nbsp; Employees are eligible for EPSL from their first day of employment.

                           <p>Our university is committed to limiting the impact of the Coronavirus (COVID-19) and
                              keeping our students, faculty, and staff safe.&nbsp;Classes are continuing through remote
                              instruction. Critical work will continue to be done on campus, such as residential
                              housing support, remote instruction support, IT, public safety, and some administrative
                              services. However, unless specifically directed by their supervisor,&nbsp;<strong>EMPLOYEES SHOULD NOT REPORT TO CAMPUS.</strong></p>
                           
                           <p>Based on guidance from Governor McMaster, beginning March 23, 2020, and until the
                              university resumes normal operation, or until further notice, supervisors will allow
                              employees to work remotely to the extent possible. Every effort will be made to assign
                              remote work to employees, including temporary employees, and work may be assigned
                              on a part-time or full-time basis. Employees may feel free to suggest work opportunities
                              to their supervisor. Please refer to the&nbsp;<a href="/uploadedFiles/hr/time-leave/TEMPORARY-Telecommuting-or-Remote-Work-Guidelines.pdf">Temporary and Remote Telecommuting/Remote Employment Guidelines</a>&nbsp;for additional information.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p>On Monday, March 23, 2020, employees may come to campus to retrieve work-related or
                              personal items between 10:00 a.m. and 3:00 p.m. During this time, employees are expected
                              to be on&nbsp;campus only long enough to retrieve items and should not remain for an extended
                              period of time. While on campus, employees must practice social distancing.&nbsp; Employees
                              are prohibited from bringing children to work either during this item retrieval period
                              on March 23, 2020, or at any time during the COVID-19 event.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p><strong><u>Regardless of whether employees are continuing to work, timesheets and leave reports
                                    are required to be submitted according to the submission deadlines on Wingspan.&nbsp;&nbsp;</u></strong>According to state guidelines, unless the governor allows leave with pay associated
                              with emergency closures of state institutions, employees must use available leave
                              or take leave without pay for related absences. At this time, the governor has not
                              allowed leave with pay for this COVID-19 event.&nbsp; Based on this, please refer to the
                              information below regarding time reporting.&nbsp; If at a later date the governor determines
                              that leave with pay can be provided for all, or a portion of the time, employees would
                              be reimbursed for leave used.

                           <p>Academic Leadership has approved an adjustment in the determination of academic standing
                              at the end of the Spring 2020 semester.&nbsp; Academic Standing will be calculated similar
                              to the end of summer session.&nbsp; Students currently on probation who raise their GPA
                              above the target GPA will be taken off probation and returned to Good Standing.&nbsp; Any
                              student on probation who does not raise their GPA above the target GPA will remain
                              on probation.&nbsp; No students will be placed on academic suspension or academic dismissal
                              at the end of Spring 2020.&nbsp;
                           </p>
                           
                           <p>With the changes to the grading options, the S/U election and extension of the course
                              withdrawal deadline, very few students should see their GPA drop below the required
                              level. This change in applying the academic standing rules will minimize the impact
                              of the changes in instruction caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.&nbsp; For details on all

                           <p>Dear Students,</p>
                           
                           <p>Faculty and academic leaders made two additional adjustments to our Spring 2020 accommodations
                              for students.&nbsp;
                           </p>
                           
                           <p>1) We extended the deadline to withdraw from a course until the last day of classes,
                              April 27. This applies to all undergraduate and graduate students. Please think carefully
                              about whether withdrawing from a course is a better option than choosing S/U or taking
                              an incomplete. Discuss these options with your faculty, advisors, and/or student services
                              professionals.&nbsp; Here is our FAQ on the course withdrawal extension. Please read it
                              before sending any questions:&nbsp;&nbsp;<a title="/recandreg/course-withdrawal-spring2020.aspx" href="/recandreg/course-withdrawal-spring2020.aspx">https://www.winthrop.edu/recandreg/course-withdrawal-spring2020.aspx</a></p>
                           
                           <p>2) We have also made changes to grading options for<u>&nbsp;graduate students</u>.&nbsp;Members of the graduate faculty and academic leadership at Winthrop University have
                              approved changes to the Spring 2020 graduate grading policies in order to further
                              minimize the potential negative impacts of the shift to remote instruction on graduate
                              student performance. Previous communications regarding grading options only extended
                              to undergraduate students. Those decisions are still in place.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p>In short, any graduate student who earns a B-, C+, or C grade in Spring 2020 will
                              automatically receive credit (CR) grades on their records, and the grades will not
                              be counted in the GPA calculation. Any graduate student receiving an F in Spring 2020
                              will automatically receive an unsatisfactory (UN) grade on their record, and the F
                              will not be counted in the GPA calculation. The graduate grading scale does not include
                              C- or D-level grades. Veterans who require F grades to retain benefits will still
                              receive them.&nbsp;
                           </p>

                              reaching out to faculty, advisors, and student services professionals with additional

                           <p>Hello All,</p>
                           
                           <p>I write to share with you the <a class="title" href="#aa4-6">most recent guidance</a> provided to students earlier today, resulting from a proposal that came to Academic
                              Council on Friday. We had a great conversation and arrived at a plan that will help
                              undergraduate students with the uncertainties that may result from the switch to remote
                              instruction. I know some students are still struggling to work from cell phones. I
                              can't imagine working to my full potential if I only had my cell phone as a tool,
                              as powerful as it is. This guidance has been added to the campus website, along with&nbsp;<a title="/uploadedFiles/emergency/Spring2020GradingFlowchartWithFAQs.pdf" href="/uploadedFiles/emergency/Spring2020GradingFlowchartWithFAQs.pdf">FAQs, a flowchart, and GPA calculation examples (pdf - 1 MB)</a>&nbsp;to help students and faculty understand these changes.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p>I also want to draw to your attention the incentive funding we are allocating from
                              next year's budget.&nbsp; Any full-time faculty members who sign up for the WOTC 101 and
                              102 sections commencing on April 10 in order to convert a currently-scheduled face-to-face
                              course for fully online delivery on Blackboard for the first time this summer will
                              receive an additional $1000 in professional development funds on top of their normal
                              college allocation. Adjuncts will continue to receive $700 stipends for completing
                              WOTC 101 and 102; the stipend is paid after the online course has been taught.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p>Finally, I wanted to let you know that the Board of Trustees approved a resolution
                              this morning to allow for test-optional admissions as a result of SAT and ACT test
                              cancellations. We will suspend our requirement of the SAT or ACT tests for admission
                              to Winthrop, for summer 2020 and academic year 2020-2021 admissions only.&nbsp;
                           </p>
                           
                           <p>Let me know if you have any questions. I know you all are moving mountains to be there
                              for our students, providing new modes of instruction, advising them for course registration,
                              and being on call (literally) for all of the other very important work that you do.
                              Many, many thanks for your unflagging energy and commitment to ensuring that they
                              finish strong.

                           <p>Dear Undergraduate Students,</p>
                           
                           <p>Members of the faculty and academic leadership at Winthrop University have approved
                              additional changes to our Spring 2020 grading policies in order to further minimize
                              the potential negative impacts of the shift to remote instruction on student performance.&nbsp;
                              As a result, we are providing this additional guidance for all undergraduate students
                              and faculty. In short, any undergraduate students who earn D grades in Spring 2020
                              will automatically receive credit (CR) grades on their records, and the D will not
                              be counted in the GPA calculation. Any undergraduate student receiving an F in Spring
                              2020 will automatically receive an unsatisfactory (UN) grade on their record, and
                              the F will not be counted in the GPA calculation.&nbsp;
                           </p>
                           
                           <p>This will help those students who have already opted into S/U as well. Any undergraduate
                              students who have already selected S/U and who earn a D-level grade will earn a CR
                              and keep the credit hours. The CR will not be counted in the GPA calculation. These
                              details are spelled out in the chart below and in the <a title="FAQs, flowchart, and GPA calculation examples" href="/uploadedFiles/emergency/Spring2020GradingFlowchartWithFAQs.pdf">FAQs, flowchart, and GPA calculation examples (pdf - 1 MB)</a>.

                           <p>As you have already learned, undergraduate students will have the option to elect
                              additional S/Us on or before the final day of classes.&nbsp; It is very important for you
                              to make a well-informed decision about choosing to use S/U grading instead of a letter
                              grade for one or more of your classes this semester.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p>We want to make sure that you do not make an S/U decision that could negatively impact
                              (1) your&nbsp; Life/Hope or other scholarships, (2) your eligibility for future classes,
                              (3) your overall academic progress, or&nbsp; (4) perhaps even your upcoming graduation.&nbsp;
                              Consequently, we suggest that you speak with your advisor or the Student Services
                              professionals in your college prior to selecting the S/U option for a particular class
                              if you have questions or concerns. If you have already selected S/U for some or all
                              of your classes, review that decision with your advisor and/or the Student Services
                              professionals in your college.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p>Here are only a few things you should consider:</p>
                           
                           <ul>
                              
                              <li>If you select an S/U in all your courses, you could jeopardize your Life/Hope or Palmetto
                                 Scholarship if your GPA after fall was below a 3.000 (or you don’t have a GPA yet
                                 because Spring 2020 is your first college semester).
                              </li>
                              
                              <li>If you are graduating in May or August and need a specific course that you are taking
                                 this semester, remember that a D- in a course gives you credit for the course; a U
                                 does not.
                              </li>
                              
                              <li>If you are not graduating in May or August, you should consult your&nbsp;<em>Catalog&nbsp;</em>to make sure that you know the specific pre-requisite grade requirements for courses
                                 you plan to take in Fall 2020 or later in your degree program. We will accept S grades
                                 as satisfying pre-requisite requirements based upon the unique situation this semester.
                                 However, a U will not satisfy a pre-requisite requirement, whereas a D- might (unless
                                 the pre-requisite course&nbsp;<em>also</em>&nbsp;has a letter-grade requirement).
                              </li>
                              
                           </ul>
                           
                           <p>Again, please use the right resources:&nbsp; your specific&nbsp;<em>Winthrop University Catalog,</em>&nbsp;your advisor, or your Student Services professionals.&nbsp; Your best friend may not have
                              the correct information.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p>Your academic progress and your health are priorities for us.&nbsp; Please take advantage
                              of the assistance available to you.

                           <p>Hello All,</p>
                           
                           <p>As each of you are busy performing incredible feats of re-imagination, I wanted to
                              send a few reminders and words of encouragement:
                           </p>
                           
                           <p>1) Keep checking into the coronavirus website. Important updates show up daily, such
                              as....
                           </p>
                           
                           <p>2) Students have selected times to retrieve their belongings this week, with access
                              windows that started today and will end Saturday. This may impact their ability to
                              respond quickly on remote assignments or advising.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p>3) This is the first week. Like the first pancake, it may not be perfect. That's okay.</p>
                           
                           <p>4) Think "less is more," and allow yourself and the students you teach/support/advise
                              to ease into all of this change.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p>5) As you prepare for advising appointments and student problem-solving, think about
                              places where you might tweak your normal checkpoints, such as asking students whether
                              they are opting into additional S/U's and what they need to keep in mind if they have.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p>Have a great Wednesday!</p>

                           <p>Dear Winthrop Faculty and Staff,</p>
                           
                           <p>Let me begin by saying I am deeply impressed by the resilience and problem-solving
                              efforts I am seeing across Academic Affairs as we all work to prepare for remote instruction,
                              and now with new guidance from Governor McMaster, remote work from home as well! We
                              are reinventing our jobs and roles daily, in response to rapidly changing conditions.
                              Responding to this environment requires patience, creativity, and teamwork. I have
                              the utmost confidence in all of you as you find new ways to deliver on your unwavering
                              commitment to the success of our students. That is why I chose to work at Winthrop.
                              We put student learning at the center of all we do, and that has not changed. We’ve
                              got this!
                           </p>
                           
                           <p>Please know that the Academic Leadership team, Senior Leadership, and the Board of
                              Trustees stand ready to support you in any way possible as we shift to remote instruction
                              and the remote work environment. Stay tuned to email for updates as we reinvent business
                              processes. Don’t forget to utilize the resources available on our&nbsp;<a href="/onlinelearning/continuity-of-instruction.aspx">Continuity of Instruction</a>&nbsp;website, which we are updating frequently as new resources are made available.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p>Please communicate frequently with your students and remember that next week in particular
                              will be a test-drive on many levels. Please provide as much flexibility in your asynchronous
                              remote instruction plans as possible, as students will need to retrieve their personal
                              items from the residence halls in addition to completing course work and planning
                              for advising sessions.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p>Supports are being developed for students as well, such as the&nbsp;<a href="/onlinelearning/preparing-for-remote-learning.aspx">resources for remote learning</a>&nbsp;site provided through our Winthrop Office of Online Learning. Many other supports
                              are available via remote access as well, including tutoring and counseling.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p>A few updates for all that will help us move through the remainder of the semester
                              with additional focus on course completion and making steady academic progress:
                           </p>
                           
                           <ul>
                              
                              <li>All remaining Cultural Events credits for seniors planning to graduate in May or August
                                 2020 are being waived, as long as students meet all other degree requirements to graduate.
                              </li>
                              
                           </ul>
                           
                           <ul>
                              
                              <li>For Spring 2020 only, all students will have the option through April 28 (study day)
                                 to choose S/U as a grading method for all courses, whether they are major, minor,
                                 or elective requirements and regardless of the current number of courses they may
                                 have selected for this grading method. The Registrar will contact students regarding
                                 how to request the S/U grading method.
                              </li>
                              
                           </ul>
                           
                           <ul>
                              
                              <li>Please communicate with your students soon and frequently, if you have not already.
                                 Have contingencies for your contingencies. If you’re all set to go online or have
                                 your remote assignments lined up, that’s great! Perhaps also get cell numbers in case
                                 you need to set up another communication method.
                              </li>
                              
                           </ul>
                           
                           <ul>
                              
                              <li>Advising will also start next week, and will require adjustments as well. Cut yourself
                                 and your students some slack; it doesn’t have to be perfect. Think of this as an opportunity
                                 to look beyond the chaos of Spring 2020, and put tentative plans in place for Summer
                                 and Fall 2020 courses. Use this opportunity to review with students whether to take
                                 advantage of increased S/U options!
                              </li>
                              
                           </ul>
                           
                           <ul>
                              
                              <li>Students who are currently enrolled in internships and other experiential opportunities
                                 may have unique questions. Make sure you are prepared to answer them, with updated
                                 information from your particular college dean or department chair.
                              </li>
                              
                           </ul>
                           
                           <div>&nbsp;</div>
                           
                           <p>Next week, in the language of my teenagers and the ancients, will be epic! But I have
                              deep confidence in all of you. Your creativity, talent, and dedicated teamwork will
                              see us all through the challenges ahead.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p>Please check in to the&nbsp;<a href="/emergency/coronavirus.aspx">campus coronvirus website</a>&nbsp;frequently. News from Academic Affairs has been separated out from other updates,
                              and will continue to be posted there in the future. I will do my best to keep you
                              all apprised of changes as they arise. Once the dust has settled on the shift to remote
                              instruction and remote work, you will hear from me again on plans for resuming our
                              other work and responding to other pressing questions, such as what this means for
                              faculty on the tenure track who are missing out on important professional development
                              opportunities. I am thinking about and working on all of those things. Adolphus Belk
                              and I will work together to make sure we have solutions in place in support of the
                              faculty and staff.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p>Best of luck in your remote instruction adventures, and thanks in advance for doing
                              all you can to model positive thinking, resilience, and creative problem-solving for
                              our students.

                           <p>Dear Winthrop Students,</p>
                           
                           <p>I am deeply impressed by the resilience and problem-solving skills faculty and staff
                              are tapping into in preparation for the shift to remote instruction next week, and
                              now with new guidance from Governor McMaster, they are figuring out how to work from
                              home as well, just as you are! We are reinventing our jobs and roles daily, in response
                              to rapidly changing conditions. Responding to this environment requires patience,
                              creativity, and teamwork. I have the utmost confidence in our faculty and staff, who
                              are unwavering in their commitment to your success.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p>Next week will see us moving into remote instruction, most of which will be asynchronous,
                              which means you will have some flexibility in when you work on assignments. This may
                              be new to you! So please communicate regularly with your faculty and advisor as you
                              make plans to return to campus to retrieve your personal items, and as you commence
                              remote instruction tasks. Monitor emails and texts. Check out the <a title="resources for remote learning" href="/onlinelearning/preparing-for-remote-learning.aspx">resources for remote learning</a> provided through our Winthrop Office of Online Learning. Many other supports have
                              been moved to remote access as well, including tutoring, counseling, and general advising
                              processes. Rest assured that we will be here to answer your questions as we work through
                              this transition together!
                           </p>
                           
                           <p>A few updates for all that will help us move through the remainder of the semester
                              with additional focus on course completion and making steady academic progress:
                           </p>
                           
                           <ul>
                              
                              <li>All remaining Cultural Events credits for seniors planning to graduate in May or August
                                 2020 are hereby waived, as long as students meet all other degree requirements to
                                 graduate.
                              </li>
                              
                              <li>For Spring 2020 only, all undergraduate students will have the option through April
                                 28 (study day) to choose S/U as a grading method for all courses, whether they are
                                 major, minor or elective requirements and regardless of the current number of courses
                                 they may have selected for this grading method. The Registrar will contact students
                                 regarding how to request the S/U grading method. Discuss whether this is a good option
                                 for you with your advisor!
                              </li>
                              
                              <li>Advising will also start next week, and will require adjustments as well. Think of
                                 this as an opportunity to look beyond the chaos of Spring 2020, and put plans in place
                                 for Summer and Fall 2020 courses. What are your next steps? What do you need to do
                                 to be ready for them?
                              </li>
                              
                           </ul>
                           
                           <p>Just as I am confident in the faculty and staff as they prepare to support you, I
                              am also confident in your ability to take these changes in stride and find a path
                              forward to complete your goals. Winthrop students impress me daily with their strength,
                              resolve, and flexibility. Working together, a community with this much talent can
                              get through a challenge of this size and learn things we did not know about ourselves
                              in the process. We’ve got this! Please don’t hesitate to reach out to me at <a title="provost@winthrop.edu" href="mailto:provost@winthrop.edu">provost@winthrop.edu</a> with any questions you have in the coming weeks.

                           <p>I wanted to provide you with an update on the status of your bookstore in light of
                              the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p>On Tuesday, March 24th, we closed our Barnes &amp; Noble College campus stores to best
                              protect the health and well-being of our employees, students and campus communities.
                              While we had originally planned to reopen our stores on Monday, April 6th, continued
                              developments in the spread of COVID-19 have led us to re-evaluate our plans.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p>Your bookstore will remain temporarily closed to the public. We will continue to follow
                              federal, state and your campus guidelines for an appropriate re-opening date for the
                              stores.

                              classes. We will not be charging any students who were unable to return their books
                              in time.

                              campus, pack up and move out your belongings, return your room key, and leave campus.
                              Below is a link that will take you to the app for scheduling your move-out time. The
                              schedule runs from Tuesday, March 24 through Saturday, 28 for move-out. It is imperative
                              for the health and wellness of our campus community that you abide by the time you
                              selected and confirmed. If you show up outside of the time you selected, you may be
                              turned away. <strong>All exterior doors will be locked without resident access and includes Roddey and
                                 Courtyard residents.</strong></p>

                           <p>This information was sent to all resident students from Residence Life to prepare
                              students for moving out of the residence halls:
                           </p>
                           
                           <p>As announced on March 19, 2020, by President Hynd, Winthrop University will be extending
                              remote learning for the duration of the semester. Residence Life is developing a plan
                              for residents to return to campus to collect their belongings and return their room
                              key. This plan is being created with CDC recommendations for social distancing as
                              a priority to ensure the health and safety of the campus community.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p>Please do not show up unannounced to gather your personal belongings. It is very important
                              that you adhere to this request. Residence Life does not have the proper staffing
                              in place for this process yet. Students will not have access to their residence hall
                              and will be told to return home. This includes Courtyard and Roddey residents.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p>Our plan will consist of a staggered move-out process with residents selecting the
                              date and window of time in which they will return to campus. Information about the
                              staggered move-out process will be sent to your Winthrop University email. Please
                              continue to monitor your email frequently.

                           <p>Dear Colleagues,</p>
                           
                           <p>Winthrop’s senior leadership has been evaluating options to mitigate the risks associated
                              with current economic realities, both domestic and abroad. As we continue to navigate
                              these uncharted waters, it is imperative that we all work together to control our
                              collective expenses.&nbsp;
                           </p>
                           
                           <p><strong>Budget Freeze</strong></p>
                           
                           <p>Our first response to mitigate these risks is an immediate budget freeze on normal
                              activities through April 30, 2020, in order to perform a year-end reallocation exercise
                              to support the following:
                           </p>
                           
                           <p>Assessment of appropriate expenditures required during this critical time that fall

                           </p>
                           
                           <ul>

                                 career services, and other key initiatives to attract and retain students in our various
                                 programs across campus
                              </li>
                              
                              <li>Police and facilities activities and supplies to keep our campus safe, clean, and
                                 accessible for workers and students who must be here for the next month and for everyone
                                 else when the time is right to return

                           <p>In order to help control spending, effectively immediately, all expenses will require
                              approval by the vice president or dean of each respective unit on campus. In addition,
                              all expenses over $5,000 will require additional approval by the CFO or AVP of Finance.
                              These controls should significantly reduce expenditures across the university and
                              help us meet our financial challenges as our situation becomes more clear.
