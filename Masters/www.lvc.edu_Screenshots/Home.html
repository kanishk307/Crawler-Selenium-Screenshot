			<div class="accordion_item_description">
				<p>On Tuesday, May 26, 2020, Lebanon Valley College was notified that a subcontractor for the Heilman Center construction project inside the Arnold Sports Center tested positive for COVID-19. The individual showed symptoms on May 19 and was diagnosed with COVID-19 May 26.</p>
<p> The individual was working in a sectioned-off construction zone, entered and exited through a designated contractor door, and used a contractor bathroom. The individual and the individual’s work partner are now self-isolated off-campus. The space has been disinfected.</p>
<p>To protect yourself and prevent the spread of COVID-19, continue to follow good hygiene practices: Wear a mask when you are in close proximity to others, wash your hands often for at least 20 seconds, cough or sneeze into your elbow, stay hydrated, eat healthfully, and practice physical distancing.</p>
<p>LVC’s first priority is the health and safety of the community. For health and safety measures, please refer to <a title="Centers for Disease Control & Prevention" href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Centers for Disease Control & Prevention</a> and <a title="PA Department of Health" href="https://www.health.pa.gov/topics/disease/coronavirus/Pages/Coronavirus.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PA Department of Health</a> resources.</p>
<p>If you experience symptoms such as fever, tiredness, dry cough, runny nose, aches and pains, or digestive issues:</p>
<ul>
<li>Avoid contact with others</li>
<li>Clean and disinfect surfaces</li>
<li>Rest</li>
<li>Contact your healthcare provider</li>
<li>Do not come to work or school.</li>

				<p><em>May 6, 2020</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Dear LVC Community,</p>
<p>As this historic Spring 2020 semester draws to a close, I am inspired by the accomplishments and agility of our students, their families, faculty, and staff. You have overcome challenges and adapted to often daily changes requiring strength of mind, body, emotion, and spirit. It has been an honor to lead the College for eight years and to once again see LVC at its best</p>
<p>Now the College has begun in earnest to prepare for what comes next. I am happy to report that the College is deep into planning for an in-person start of the fall 2020 semester. The College&rsquo;s senior leadership and Critical Incident &amp; Emergency Management Team are developing several scenarios for opening up LVC gradually over the summer. These plans will be based on guidance the Pennsylvania Department of Health expects to release May 15, as well as recommendations from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control &amp; Prevention. We are also vetting potential partners to advise and assist with any needed mitigation strategies.</p>
<p>The team is working closely with incoming president Dr. James MacLaren to define the next eight weeks, and he will take the lead on planning for the next academic year. His experience as part of the team that led Tulane University Katrina-recovery efforts will be invaluable to this process.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The scenarios we are outlining will be flexible. Scheduling may change to reduce density in classrooms and labs. Residence halls may hold fewer students, and there might temporarily be more commuters. Even though the way students learn in the fall will likely be different from how it has been in the past, rest assured that Lebanon Valley College is committed to maintaining the same level of personalized attention it has always given to students. Student affairs will develop co-curricular programming to maintain the community connectedness that makes LVC so special. Learning outcomes will not change, and students will be on the same path to graduate on-time and fully prepared for career or post-graduate studies.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are still many unknowns, including questions related to athletics, student worker opportunities for fall, move-in and Orientation, dining services, and the status of the virus and its spread. As conditions change, LVC will keep you informed.</p>
<p>Please continue to practice physical distancing, and encourage each other&mdash;remotely&mdash;as we show the world what it means to be #LVCStrong.</p>
<p>Warmest Regards,</p>
<p>President Lewis E. Thayne</p>			</div>

			<div class="accordion_item_description">
				<p><em>April 28, 2020</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Dear Students,</p>
<p>All of us at LVC understand that final exam week can be a stressful time, and we are here to help you successfully wrap up this crazy semester. We also recognize that sometimes hearing a few supportive words can make all the difference when you are feeling overwhelmed, or think that you just can’t study one more moment.</p>
<p>Below are messages from some of your LVC professors. From advice, to supportive messages, to inspiring poetry, take a moment to read what they wanted to share with all of you as you prepare for your final exams, papers, and projects. As a community, we all are cheering for you and we know that you can end this semester on a high note!</p>
<p>Remember: You can do it! We believe in you!</p>
<p><em>— Dr. Monica Cowart, Provost & Vice President of Academic Affairs</em></p>
<hr />
<p>Every generation has its challenges, and, from those challenges, leaders are made. You are strong, and bold, and able to successfully navigate through any twist or turn. We are all dealing with uncertainty and unpredictability during these unprecedented times. I encourage you all to take a break, do something for yourself and improve your overall well-being. We are all in this together!</p>
<p><em>—Dr. Lindsay Koch, Department of Education</em></p>
<hr />
<p>We are at that time of year when we are all trying to make our final push—finishing up our final projects and prepping for final exams (this is just as much a faculty thing as it is a student thing!). Even though our educational environment has been disrupted by COVID19, stay-in-place orders, and the transition to online learning and education, how we lead into the end of the semester shouldn’t change. You can and should structure and organize your time to the best of your ability. If you function best early-to-bed and early-to-rise…stick with that. If you like to exercise, make sure that you fit it into your routine. If you usually rely on campus travel to get some much-needed steps and moments of clarity, try to mix a walk around the block or do standing marching in place at your desk. Also, you can’t be all study all the time—make sure to take some much needed you time to avoid burning out. Talk to your friends, enjoy your favorite TV show, watch a zoo live feed, and don’t feel guilty while doing it. You can and will finish strong. We are so impressed with how you have handled this situation up to this point, and you will continue to impress at the end of the charge.</p>

<p>Graduating is a monumental achievement. Take the time to be proud of yourself. Thank all who played a role in your journey. Let yourself be celebrated and celebrate yourself. Embrace the feelings of accomplishment, remember the hard work you put forth and the fun you had. I am so proud of you and I am excited to see what life has in store for you! Go get them. The sky is the limit. Congratulations!</p>

<p>There are a few days during the semester and in life that are higher stakes than others. You are feeling this now with finals right around the corner. Prepare yourself as much as you can for these occasions. But besides these bigger moments, keep track of your smaller accomplishments throughout the semester and take pride in them. They matter just as much as the higher stakes moments. Don't worry too much if you make mistakes. Every faculty member, staff member, and administrator you see has made a bunch of them. Be kind to yourself and make those mistakes a learning moment for going forward.</p>

<p>We are living through exceptional times, and I have been moved by the way in which all my students have rallied, empathized, and supported each other. Despite the trials and tribulations, and especially in the face of enormous challenges, you have continued to try your best and to meet your academic goals and ensure the continued success of our classes. I am inspired by all of you; I feel motivated and energized because of you. This is the proverbial home stretch and exams, papers, project due dates loom ahead. You’ve been preparing for this all semester—have faith in yourselves; you have got this. It may seem daunting, especially since you can’t swing by our offices or study together with friends in the library. But that’s what the wonder of the Internet is for—set up virtual study dates and drop by virtual office hours. The best advice I can give is to pace yourself and breakdown your work into smaller more digestible chunks. And reach out if you need help, we’re all here for you. We can do this together!</p>

<p>Dear Students,</p>
<p>I’ve been one of the lucky ones. I’ve been able to see and interact with you each week in your voice lessons. I’ve been able to talk to you individually, to ask you how you are, to hear you when it’s been challenging, and when it’s been good. We’ve made your dogs howl and your cats hide during your vocal warmups. More importantly, we’ve taken a moment to do what we do as musicians—to put some beauty back into the world that so desperately needs it right now. Music is a beneficial therapy, whether you’re a practicing musician or just an avid listener.</p>
<p>I’ve been drawing on the Psalms during this time, especially Psalm 121. The final verses are: “The Lord will keep you from all evil;/he will keep your life. /The Lord will keep your going out and your coming in/from this time on and forevermore.” [NRSV]. I pray you and your families will remain safe during these next few months, and may you return safely to us in September!</p>

<p>Dear Students,</p>
<p>I have been so impressed with how you have negotiated the change to remote learning. You have tackled this challenge with grace and it has been the highlight of my week to see your smiling faces on my computer screen. As we move into the final exam period I am looking forward to reading your concluding projects. Please take time each day to clear your mind, whether that be working out, meditating, or playing your instrument. Taking care of yourself mentally, spiritually, and physically is the most important thing! You can do this, and please know that I am behind you 100 percent! Do not hesitate to reach out to me if you have questions or concerns.</p>

Be very proud of that accomplishment! You are stronger than you realize, and you have risen to the challenge set before you. This experience gives you resilience! You are gaining unique life experiences that only your generation will know. I am confident that your generation will take the knowledge gained from this experience and use it to make the world a better place for everyone.</p>

<p>Make a list! Whether it is on a cute template, notepad, or napkin, just write down what needs to be done. The best part is being able to cross it off when it is complete! I typically have multiple lists going (one for the week, one long-term) but at the end of the semester, one list should get you through. Take one task at a time and then cross it off. It also helps to break bigger assignments up over a few days, so it feels a little less daunting. Stick to the list; it won’t let you down!</p>

<p>A message of support for students going into finals week, that I shared with my FYE students each semester and all of my advisees, is to take 10–15 minutes each day to 'fill your cup'. Whether that is going for a run, gaming, listening to music, socializing with friends, or meditating, purposefully planning 10–15 minutes each day to do something that 'fills you up' is critical, especially when there is increased stress and demands. We tend to remove from our schedule the activities that recharge and help us when faced with increased workloads and demands, which is the exact time when those activities are most needed. I wish you a great day!  Stay healthy and well.</p>

<p>We all have a lot of responsibilities that we are trying to maintain during this period of global uncertainty. It’s a lot of stress for everyone in the LVC family, whether you’re a student, teacher, staff member, administrator, or anyone connected to our college. Make sure to leave some time open in your schedule every day that you can fill with whatever you most need: a walk in the sunshine, making cookies with your little brother, some time on the couch with a good book, a phone call to a grandparent, or some solo basketball in the driveway.  Pay attention to these moments. Enjoy them. They are at least as important as the rest of your schedule—if not more so.</p>

			<div class="accordion_item_description">
				<p><em>April 22, 2020</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Dear Alumni, Families, and Friends of LVC:</p>
<p>In eight years at the College, I thought I had seen LVC at its best, but I can assure you this crisis has brought out a strength of spirit, determination, and consideration of others that makes us all proud to be part of the LVC community. I would like to share a sense of the College’s extraordinary response to the coronavirus crisis as well as a few of the ways in which alumni, families, and friends can participate in the celebrations at the end of this historic and unprecedented academic year.  </p>
<p>Five weeks ago, all our classes and offices moved online. Within three days, families moved most of our students out of campus residence halls and into their homes or the homes of friends. Where we had nearly 1,200 students in our residence halls and in four countries studying abroad, we now have three students living in one campus house and one student in New Zealand completing her spring term. My hope in repeating the facts is that the reality of what we accomplished, and the sheer grit of the Lebanon Valley College community, could be felt. A 370-acre campus with 1,800 students and 450+ faculty and staff has become a virtual community, connected by the Internet, and functioning very effectively in response to the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p>These last five weeks have been proof-positive of the LVC spirit of resilience and connection. Among much recent <a title="good news" href="https://www.lvc.edu/news/1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">good news</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>We recently learned that Allyson Butz ’20, early childhood education, was selected for a Fulbright English Teaching Assistant Award to Germany for 2020–21, marking the fifth year in a row that the Fulbright program has named LVC students among its awardees.</li>
<li>Christian Lantz ’21, a biochemistry & molecular biology major, has been named a Goldwater Scholar by The Barry Goldwater Scholarship in Education Foundation. This is a highly prestigious research award in STEM disciplines.</li>
<li>Brandon Roy ’20, biochemistry & molecular biology, who has already received a fully-funded Ph.D. offer from Cornell University, was named a Fulbright alternate for a study/research grant in London, England.</li>
<li>Malia Waltman ’20, digital communications and international business, was named an alternate for a Boren Award to China for 2020–21.</li>
<li>We received word late last week that our Athletic Training Program has been accredited by the Commission on Accreditation of Athletic Training Education; one of just two institutions on the East Coast that are fully compliant with the 2020 standards.</li>
<li>I am very happy to report very positive results to date in undergraduate admissions, retention of current students, summer course enrollment, graduate program demand, and student progress. LVC’s exceptional student experience, dynamic mix of pre-professional and liberal arts courses, institutional momentum, and strong sense of community continue to attract great students.</li>
</ul>
<p>There is more good news to come in the virtual spring issue of The Valley magazine, which you will receive a link to next week.</p>
<p>We are all eager to get safely back to campus, but we are also aware of the enormous, heroic effort that has enabled the College to do so well under difficult, stressful conditions. Lebanon Valley College has done its part in the efforts to contain the spread of COVID-19 and deliver on the promise to our students to ensure their safety and continue their education. For their part, our students had to move out of their residence halls, say goodbye to friends, establish access and virtual class and study schedules, navigate new expectations, and, in so many cases, bear the disappointments and cancellations of so much that is traditionally part of the LVC experience. I commend our students; and I commend LVC’s faculty and staff for their tireless attention to guiding our students to success through this crisis:</p>
<p>Academic support efforts were redoubled to assist students with the adjustment to virtual learning, to restructure study habits, and connect with peer mentors.</p>
<p>IT staff provided laptops, technology, and software licenses to students, and assistance to those who needed wireless service while learning from home.</p>
<p>Faculty members redesigned courses to work more effectively in a virtual format, including lab methods instruction.</p>
<p>An emergency pass/fail grading policy was implemented by the faculty to assist students in prioritizing and focusing on courses in majors.</p>
<p>We have now turned our attention to moving all new student advising, summer courses, and research to a virtual format and have begun scenario planning for the fall. The LVC COVID-19 information page is updated frequently if you would like to see more details about the College’s response to the pandemic. Our goal for the fall is to move LVC safely back to campus.</p>
<p>Beyond the digital classroom, staff created and organized activities to engage students through online student affairs programming, video chats, and social media content promoting health and well-being, academic and personal support, and fun. Student Government continues its meeting and activity schedule. Many student organizations have continued to meet online, in part to stay connected and in part to plan for next year. Recitals and performances have also gone online, even as coaches work with their teams to maintain physical conditioning, connection, and recruiting for next year. </p>
<p>We are working very hard to bring in a great class of new students in the fall. A temporary transfer credit policy was approved to make it possible for students who want to move closer to home or otherwise would prefer to come to LVC. Admission sponsored a Student Acceptance week of activities and opportunities to engage with faculty, students, and coaches that was attended by 247 admitted students.</p>
<p>My sincere thanks to the many alumni and friends who offered career and personal support to our students and who contributed to the Student Emergency Fund to help us meet their critical needs. Your care and concern mean so much to the LVC community. I am happy to announce that you will have another opportunity to celebrate and support our students. I invite you to join us for a <a title="Virtual Celebration of Graduates" href="https://spark.adobe.com/page/E7cROlPGRc09Y/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Virtual Celebration of Graduates</a>, which will take place Saturday, May 2, through Saturday, May 9. Events include cap decorating, the President’s Toast to the Class, academic and other honors, and athletic honors. The Virtual Celebration week will conclude with the conferral of degrees and awards on May 9. I have seen the plans and examples and am very excited about what is being produced. You will be, too.</p>
<p>I would like nothing better than to hold the on-campus Commencement Ceremony our graduates very much deserve. I have promised them the College will do so once government and public health officials deem it safe for us to be together in large groups.</p>
<p>Dorry and I are grateful for the many expressions of care and concern we received during this period. We had planned a very different final semester and farewell, but, like you, we are doing the absolute best we can with what we have. I am honored and grateful to lead our great College at this time.</p>
<p>All our best wishes to you and your family, and special thanks to those who are working on the front lines to ensure the health and safety of our communities.</p>
<p>Warmly,</p>
<p>President Lewis E. Thayne</p>			</div>

<p>Dear LVC Students,</p>
<p>We have been together (while apart) for over a month now. It has been an adjustment period for all of us, and I am so impressed with the innovative ways in which LVC students, faculty and staff are remaining connected with each other during these challenging time. We don’t have to be in Annville in order to be there for each other, and you prove that daily!</p>
<p>We will continue to support each other through all of the celebrations, final projects and exams that we associate with the end of spring semester. Even if we are on WebEx or Zoom, please know that the entire LVC community is here to cheer your accomplishments, honor your achievements, and offer support as you prepare for your exams.</p>
<p>We have created many opportunities to help you through the coming weeks. <a title="A" href="https://lvc-www.s3.amazonaws.com/files/resources/2020-finals-week-resources-from-academic-success.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">A</a><a title="ttached is a finals week resource guide from the Academic Success Team" href="https://lvc-www.s3.amazonaws.com/files/resources/2020-finals-week-resources-from-academic-success.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ttached is a finals week resource guide from the Academic Success Team</a> with information regarding resources to navigate the next weeks (from study jams to virtual tutoring to writing center drop-in hours to tips for managing stress).

			<div class="accordion_item_description">
				<p>Dear Class of 2020,</p>
<p>You have all accomplished so much in the years since you first arrived on campus. Who knew that in your final semester a major part of the story of the LVC Class of 2020 would be written? I will have more to say about this story in my President’s Toast to the Class.</p>
<p>After hard work, careful study, lasting friendships, and great memories, you are now poised to become the next generation of compassionate, creative, and highly successful professionals and community leaders. I think of you every day and want you to know I am so proud of you. The entire LVC community is proud of you. Your faculty and staff mentors have poured their hearts and souls into guiding you to success so you could reach this culmination of your college experience. They and the College’s 16,000 alumni are proud to welcome you to the global Dutchmen family.</p>
<p>I would like nothing better than to hold the on-campus Commencement Ceremony you very much deserve next month. But too much uncertainty remains surrounding COVID-19 pandemic projections, especially with regard to large group gatherings, so the College is not yet ready to commit to a date for the traditional ceremony. I assure you there will be one, and we will schedule a ceremony—one specifically dedicated to the Class of 2020—once government and public health officials deem it safe for us to be together in large groups.</p>
<p>Four weeks ago, I committed to you that LVC would develop a virtual celebration of the Class of 2020. At the time, I had no idea what a virtual celebration might look like. But I knew we had talented, creative people who could develop something we could all be proud of. I also knew we could rely on you to let us know what is important to you. In your responses to our survey you told us that it should recognize individually each member of the class, include departments and the department honors programs that are part of graduation week, and connect with a personal and family dimension that is so important to graduation and the recognition of the degree you have earned. Clearly, this is a celebration that needs to happen and to take place over a period of several days.</p>
<p><strong><a title="I am delighted to share with you that A Virtual Celebration of Graduates will be held Saturday, May 2, through Saturday, May 9." href="https://www.lvc.edu/events/commencement/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">I am delighted to share with you that A Virtual Celebration of Graduates will be held Saturday, May 2, through Saturday, May 9.</a></strong> A group of staff, faculty, and students have incorporated your survey feedback and ideas into planning and are developing a series of special online experiences for you and your families. These include a cap decorating contest, champagne toast, academic and student life honors, and athletic honors. The Virtual Celebration week will conclude with the conferral of degrees on May 9. I have seen the plans and examples and I am very excited about what is being produced. You will be, too.</p>
<p>More information will be forthcoming regarding the celebration schedule and links to the content. Your diploma will be mailed to your home later this spring. If you wish, you can now <a title="order regalia online" href="https://lvc.shopoakhalli.com/purchasewizard/Welcome" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>order your regalia online</strong></a>, to be delivered to your home within two weeks of your order, so that you may take photos and celebrate with your family.</p>
<p>Thank you for your patience and your resiliency during the COVID-19 pandemic. There is nothing more that the LVC community wants than to cheer you on as you cross the Commencement stage. I and others will continue to communicate with you as further plans take shape.</p>
<p>All my best,</p>

			<div class="accordion_item_description">
				<p>Dear Lebanon Valley College Families,</p>
<p>I hope this letter finds you well. It was just two short weeks ago that I last corresponded with you. Since then, much as changed. Such rapid change, while unsettling, serves to remind us that we are adaptable, resilient, and committed to doing what we must (no matter how inconvenient) to ensure we do our part to slow the spread of the COVID-19 virus. To adapt a familiar phrase: “We are LVC Strong— We Will Get through this Together!”   </p>
<p>Later this week our community of learners complete their third full week of remote classes. For some, this transition presented a learning curve. Others handled this transition with little difficulty. But throughout, my LVC faculty and staff colleagues have remained steadfast in their commitment to ensuring a quality educational experience for all our students. Our academic support systems are robust. Our counseling support systems are active and engaged. Our co-curricular opportunities continue to expand and evolve. Our administrative functions, while pivoting frequently in response to state and federal guidelines, continue to find meaningful ways to connect with our students and families. Know that we are here for you and your students. It remains our highest priority to assist students and families through these uncertain times. Please feel free to connect with any of our campus administrative offices with your questions and concerns. We have adapted and remain committed to business as usual (or as close as circumstances permit).<a title=" You can find our list of administrative offices here." href="https://www.lvc.edu/offices-directories/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> You can find our list of administrative offices here.</a></p>
<p>Twice each week your student receives an “Updates from The Valley” email that shares information about administrative functions, social engagement, and opportunities to connect. Our coaching staff is connecting weekly with our student-athletes. Our student activities, community service, and intercultural affairs colleagues remain connected with students. Our Student Government remains active. A small sample of the engagement opportunities from this past week include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Virtual Bingo</li>
<li>Cell Phone Trivia Event</li>
<li>60 Minutes (Sun.) and OASIS (Sat.) groups were facilitated by our 50/50 Peers</li>
<li>Service to our local Annville community seniors through cards and well wishes</li>
<li>Community prayer and reflection (Tues.)</li>
<li>Trivia Tuesday through OIA Instagram</li>
<li>Virtual Fitness and Dance Challenges</li>
</ul>
<p> If your student is struggling to feel a connection with peers, faculty, or staff, please encourage them to contact me directly or any of my friends in our <a title="Student Affairs Division" href="https://www.lvc.edu/offices-directories/student-affairs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Student Affairs Division</a>.</p>
<p>The College is exploring ways to acknowledge and celebrate the accomplishments of our graduating students. Events such as our annual Awards Ceremonies, Honor Society Inductions, Inquiry 2020, and, most especially, graduation activities are being discussed. While in the foreseeable future all these celebrations will occur virtually, the College is optimistically planning for a live, in-person graduation ceremony later this year.</p>
<p>I encourage you to remind your student that our COVID-19 website is continuously updated with the latest information for our community. Our staff is ready to respond to inquiries through our <a title="information@lvc.edu" href="mailto:information@lvc.edu" target="_blank" rel="noopener">information@lvc.edu</a> email system. We welcome opportunities to connect with your student—please encourage them to reach out to any member of our LVC community with questions, concerns, or reassurance and encouragement from a familiar face. </p>
<p>Stay safe and well!</p>

<p><em>March 27, 2020</em></p>
<p>Dear Students,</p>
<p>We recognize that this past week has been challenging for all of you. We want you to know that LVC is even more committed to helping you attain your educational goals.</p>
<p><strong>You are our priority.</strong></p>
<p>We will continue to develop student-centered practices and innovative ways to support your success, especially given the unique stressors associated with the COVID-19 coronavirus. Many of you have shared your challenges with coaches, academic success specialists, professors, and tutors.</p>
<p><strong>We hear you.</strong></p>
<p>Unusual circumstances call for new policies that take our current environment into account. These policies recognize the extraordinary educational circumstances that we are all facing as a result of making a rapid and unexpected transition due to the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p><strong>We crafted an emergency pass/fail policy to meet your needs.</strong></p>
<p>The Academic Affairs team has reviewed multiple models and we have chosen the attached emergency “opt-in” model that we feel will best meet the needs of LVC’s undergraduate community. This emergency pass/fail policy will go into effect immediately and will apply to the spring semester only. In this model, you will earn grades according to the standard LVC grading scale (letter grades), but may then convert that grade to a Pass/Fail designation if you so wish and if you have advisor approval. This model requires advisor approval so that you can understand the degree implications of potentially designating a course pass/fail. For instance, in certain majors your advisor might explain that a pass/fail designation will not make sense if an external accrediting body or graduate school will not recognize a pass/fail course, or if licensure could be prevented or delayed if one decides to pass/fail specific courses. Therefore, choosing to change a course to pass/fail should not be taken lightly and will require the approval of your advisor.</p>
<p>We would like to thank Student Government, President’s Staff, Department Chair’s Council, Faculty Steering Committee, and the Faculty Policy & Budget Committee for their commitment to your success. This emergency policy could not have been approved without these groups. Also, a special thanks to the members of the academic affairs team who researched, listened to your concerns, and crafted the best policy for LVC.</p>
<p>Wishing you all a wonderful weekend!</p>
<p>All the best,</p>
<p>Monica Cowart, Ph.D., LMHC<br />Provost and Vice President of Academic Affairs</p>			</div>

			<div class="accordion_item_description">
				<p><strong>Why was the decision made to hold Human Anatomy (cadaver lab) online versus waiting until a later summer session?</strong></p>
<p>This decision was made after a lot of thoughtful consideration. All LVC summer graduate courses are being held virtually, and College leadership is scenario planning for the fall. We wanted to make sure students get the experience and credits they will need to graduate on time while upholding social distancing guidelines and keeping students, instructors, and campus staff safe.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>How will the online cadaver lab affect our learning for future physical therapy courses?</strong></p>
<p>Students should be fully prepared for further study. There is no definitive research showing that learning anatomy by way of cadaver dissection is superior to learning via a web-based program.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Will we be prepared to continue with grad school without a physical, in-person cadaver class?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, many PT programs do not use cadavers in their education. Actually, more and more programs are moving away from cadavers due to cost, space needed, onsite requirements, and medical waste removal implications.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Is there any possible way to move this class to another time?</strong></p>
<p>The fall semester cannot accommodate the course given the other coursework, and the anatomy knowledge is needed for those courses. We are planning to embed cadaver dissection into some fall courses or hold it as a stand-alone module at the end of the fall semester and/or over winter break (mid-December to mid-January) to embed some hands-on dissection. We are working through some logistical issues regarding campus access.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What are other PT programs, who also hold cadaver in the summer, planning on doing? Have they made their decision yet?</strong></p>
<p>Of the 50 percent of PT Programs that still use cadavers, most have already committed to an online transition by using a virtual anatomy program (there are two that are used by most of these programs). We vetted both of these programs for our online course as well and have decided on the Visible Body program. With regard to cadaver dissection, some of the historically cadaver-dissection-based PT programs are foregoing cadaver dissection altogether, while some are doing a “mini-dissection” module, and a small subset of others are separating lecture and lab with plans to hold graded cadaver dissection labs at another time.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>If no other college is holding a cadaver course this summer, will we be allowed to join the class below us for the hands-on portion of the course next summer?</strong></p>
<p>This is not a likely possibility due to space limitations in the cadaver lab (for both cadavers and students/instructors/teaching assistants), but isn’t out of the realm of possibilities. This may have housing implications as it is a summer course. This would not negate the need to have this anatomy information for a grade prior to the fall coursework. A course in this format could possibly be audited.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Will the cost of cadaver be decreased since we no longer are getting the full experience?</strong></p>
<p>The virtual 3D cadaver experience is a different full experience, but it is a full experience. There will be inherent immediate cost savings of not buying personal protective gear (i.e. gloves, goggles, masks, shoe covers, etc.) which are in short supply anyway due to COVID-19. Additionally, there will be a small reduction by waiving the lab dissector manual fee.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Does not having this class affect any accreditation or qualification for our program?</strong></p>
<p>The Commission on Accreditation in Physical Therapy Education (CAPTE), our accrediting body, does not mandate how PT students learn anatomy. In this COVID-19 environment, CAPTE, realizing the unique and unprecedented challenges of PT education, has given PT programs extra latitude in how students are educated while still keeping students safe and progressing forward through the curriculum.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Will this class be worth the same amount of credits?</strong></p>
<p>Yes. The course will still be five credits. The amount of lecture time will not change and the cadaver lab will be replaced with a virtual lab experience. Note: This course was a seven-credit course when the PT program was first developed as a result of the lab time, but it was reduced to five credits as we trimmed down the lab dissection time.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Will elective opportunities for dissection in fall, winter, or May term be graded activities?</strong></p>
<p>No, the grade will be established from the summer course. Elective experiences will be non-graded activities.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Third-year PT students were planning on using the Integrated Clinical Experiences (Wednesday clinical) to satisfy final Immersive Experience (IME) requirements in the undergraduate portion of the degree. How will they satisfy that requirement if they lose the clinical piece?</strong></p>
<p>We will make sure that everyone has their second IME through an internal clinical experience or an independent study project related to a future project.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Is adding the dissection as an “elective” a real possibility?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, two or three weeks is a viable option that could fit at the end of fall or winter term—this will need to be a fluid option to time correctly—possible to do this on a more limited scale using limbs or torsos to give the experience of some dissection.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Will the “elective” option be the same for Athletic Training students? The curriculum is not the same in fall, so there may not be an opportunity to find common times.</strong></p>
<p>Dr. Fink will work closely with Dr. Murphy to identify the best options, and Dr. Frank will be helping run the summer lab course, so she should also be able to provide some continuity of education on this topic.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>How will testing and assessment work?</strong></p>
<p>For didactic courses, there will be no changes—the department uses ExamSoft, a secure platform. The lab assessments will be completed through Visible Body. This assessment process can still accommodate tactile learners. Dr. Fink will also be providing high-quality videos that show dissections and body systems.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What is the course schedule?</strong></p>
<p>The schedule will be mostly asynchronous content similar to what you are currently receiving, but there may be times (if it works for everyone) to build in some synchronous activities. Dr. Fink will also be highly available to all students, and he has already hired a number of qualified instructors to help with the lab.  The course should require the same or less overall time than the traditional face-to-face cadaver course.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Will the textbook resources change?</strong></p>
<p>No, the same books will be required, and these will be important reference books into your early professional careers. There will be some cost savings from not needing safety consumables like masks, gloves, and scrubs.</p>			</div>

			<div class="accordion_item_description">
				<p>Dear Student Employee,</p>
<p>This is an update regarding student employment for the rest of the semester. Please be assured that all hours worked up until this point will be paid, provided that you submitted any hours worked using the online timesheets as you’ve always done.</p>
<p>From March 25 through May 15, the College will only employ students with positions that are deemed essential to operations and can work remotely. This includes, but is not limited to, Peer Tutors and Valley Ambassadors assisting with online chat programming. If your position is considered essential to operations, your hiring supervisor will have already contacted you regarding working remotely.</p>
<p>The College did not reach this decision easily. We recognize that student employment is one of the ways used to assist in paying expenses while enrolled. We look forward to the time when we are all back on campus working together.</p>
<p>Please visit Handshake for employment opportunities this summer and fall semesters.</p>
<p>Feel free to contact the staff in the Breen Center breencenter@lvc.edu if you have questions or concerns and they will be forwarded to the Student Employment Committee.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Student Employment Committee</p>			</div>

				<p>Capital BlueCross recently announced the following steps that will help members during this time of need.   <br /><br /><strong>In-network Inpatient Treatment:</strong> Capital BlueCross will waive member cost share (copays, coinsurance, and deductible) for in-network inpatient hospital treatment related to COVID-19, effective April 1 through May 1. This action applies to all employees participating in the LVC group policy.  <br /><br /><strong>Capital BlueCross Virtual Care app:</strong> The Capital BlueCross Virtual Care benefit cost waiver is extended through May 15. Medical, psychiatry, and counseling visits through the Capital BlueCross Virtual Care app will be free.<br /><br /><strong>Telehealth:</strong> The telehealth member cost share waiver expired at midnight on April 15. Access to telehealth (phone or video conference) with in-network providers will continue without interruption—but as of April 16, members will once again be responsible for their respective cost share (copays and deductible), which varies depending on the member’s benefit plan.  <br /><br />Employees are encouraged to use telehealth to support social distancing, prevent the spread of the virus, and help protect our healthcare workers. Telehealth uses phone or video conferencing to connect healthcare providers and patients. It’s not limited to a specific platform, app, or provider. Members may use any in-network health system’s or doctor’s telehealth apps, or contact their doctors directly to find out how to schedule a phone or video appointment. </p>			</div>

Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems, or diabetes, are more likely to develop serious illnesses.</p>			</div>

			<div class="accordion_item_description">
				<p>Dear Students,</p>
<p>Happy Monday! I am reaching out because we have heard that there have been a number of questions regarding the <a title="emergency undergraduate pass/fail policy" href="https://lvc-www.s3.amazonaws.com/files/resources/final-spring-2020-grading-accommodation.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">emergency undergraduate pass/fail policy</a> for this semester. In response to these questions, members of the Academic Affairs team have created a <a title="helpful FAQ" href="https://lvc-www.s3.amazonaws.com/files/resources/final-spring-2020-undergraduate-grading-policies-f.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">helpful FAQ</a> that covers all of the common questions one might have regarding this policy.</p>
<p>In addition, all of the student support areas within Academic Affairs have shared a number of updates on the services they continue to offer (although in a slightly different format). These opportunities (including graduate studies info sessions and virtual study jams) are designed to make your experience even better at LVC. Please simply scroll down to see what is available.</p>
<p>Finally, I want you all to know that I have moved my weekly Thursday office hours from 4–5 p.m. to a WebEx address. If you would like to drop by to just say hi, or if you would like to chat about a topic that has been on your mind (anything from your favorite Netflix shows to your thoughts on the new pass/fail policy), then please join me at the [address provided in April 6 email to students.]</p>
<p>I would love to connect. If we haven’t met before, then why not meet for the first time over WebEx? If Thursday at 4 p.m. doesn’t work with your schedule, then you also can text me to set up an appointment at a different time.</p>
<p>I realize this is a short week and I hope everyone is able to make the most of their days “away” from LVC. Wishing you all a restorative break that includes taking a few moments to recognize, appreciate and prioritize those things that are most important to you. Even if it is as simple as savoring a Reese’s peanut butter egg or hugging your dog, you all deserve some time for yourselves!</p>
<p>Take care and stay safe,</p>
<p>Dr. Cowart<br />Provost and Vice President of Academic Affairs<br />Lebanon Valley College</p>			</div>

			<h3 class="js-swap accordion_item_heading" data-swap-target=".accordion_item_2" data-swap-group="accordion_group">A Personal Note—Dr. Bob Mikus, March 25, 2020</h3>
			<div class="accordion_item_description">
				<p>Dear Lebanon Valley College Families,</p>
<p>I hope this letter finds you healthy and safe, wrapped in the comfort of loved ones during these uncertain times. Over the years I have had the privilege of meeting many of you, whether in person, over the telephone, or via email. During the past few weeks, my family communications have focused on the College’s response to and planning of the COVID-19 situation. This letter is different. It serves to affirm how life at LVC, while certainly different in the remote environment, remains centered on supporting the growth and development of the most valued members of our community—our students.</p>
<p>I write this letter from a quiet room at my house, not the active and exciting environment of the Center for Student Engagement as I am accustomed. It is a different experience. It will require flexibility and patience. It will require concerted effort to remain connected with my colleagues, my students, my friends. And as I struggle with this new experience, it is my hope that your students will understand that they are not alone. We will persevere and come through this as a stronger community—it is the LVC way!  </p>
<p>While preparing my thoughts for this letter, I asked my own college student, “What is most concerning about this COVID-19 pandemic? Are you worried about connecting with friends…transitioning to a new and different learning modality…re-evaluating your study abroad plans? The answer received was surprising: “I’m not worried about myself. I’m worried about the economy, dad, and the families who will struggle as a result.” Shocked as I was at this reply, it should not have surprised me. It reflects the caring, thoughtful, and reflective nature of this generation. Our students—your sons and daughters, nieces and nephews, grandchildren—are among the most kind and caring students with whom I’ve worked during my 27-year career. I’ve come to know and appreciate a collective selfless spirit, thinking of others more often than themselves. At times such as these, we must continue to foster that selflessness, that care and concern. It is the framework within which our LVC community has evolved for more than 150 years.</p>
<p>This COVID-19 uncertainly impacts each of us differently. However, I assure you that there remains familiarity and commonality throughout LVC. Our talented and skilled academic support team is working tirelessly to ensure that our connections with your students remain engaging, meaningful, and purposeful. Please encourage your student to remain connected to their LVC faculty and staff, their roommates and friends. Engagement opportunities are thriving! Student Government continues to meet regularly. Our Service and Volunteerism Program has identified opportunities for students to serve while away from campus. Coaches continue to support their student-athletes through virtual coaching and advising. Twice each week your students receive “Updates from The Valley,” a newsletter highlighting ways to stay engaged with LVC (and more opportunities are in the works!). I encourage you to ask your student each day how they connected with a professor, a classmate, or staff member. Such personal connections are important for our students, as well as our staff. Our faculty and staff are eager to reconnect and advance the deep and meaningful relationships we have with your student.  </p>
<p>As we move through this situation in the coming weeks, please be assured of the collective commitment of our LVC community. I welcome the opportunity to connect with you, our families, to ensure the best possible experience for your child in these uncertain times. Please accept my gratitude for the trust you’ve placed in us to guide and shape the growth and development of your student. It is a profound privilege and distinct honor to play a small part in the transformation of your student during the most incredible years of their lives!</p>
<p>Finally, we created a new email for you and our students to have any questions answered. Please email <a title="information@lvc.edu" href="mailto:information@lvc.edu" target="_blank" rel="noopener">information@lvc.edu</a> and the appropriate person will respond as soon as possible.  </p>
<p>Stay safe and be well!</p>
<p>Best,</p>

			<h3 class="js-swap accordion_item_heading" data-swap-target=".accordion_item_3" data-swap-group="accordion_group">Remote Learning, Commencement, and Perseverance—President Thayne, March 20, 2020</h3>
			<div class="accordion_item_description">
				<p>Dear Students and Families:</p>
<p>I want to begin this letter by saying thank you to all LVC students and families for your heroic efforts in response to the COVID-19 crisis. I deeply regret the necessity of having to ask students to leave campus. Thank you for your determination and, frankly, your grit to do what is necessary to safeguard your health and the health and wellbeing of all LVC students and campus community members. To date, there are no reported cases of COVID-19 in the LVC community.</p>
<p>In one week, you have been asked to move from the residence halls, convert to online classes, leave daily contact with friends, and sacrifice the truly special, personal quality of the LVC experience. I know that for many students and families, this was done at considerable personal sacrifice. </p>
<p>I spoke with faculty members at a virtual meeting yesterday and heard from them and many students and families the depth of disappointment that is being felt. I feel it personally, I can assure you. What you have achieved despite that disappointment is all the more astonishing. I am very aware of the stress caused by these abrupt changes and ongoing uncertainties. LVC is a community that is at its best in an emergency and when we all need to pull together in the same direction. The COVID-19 crisis has certainly brought out our best. </p>
<p>Last night Pennsylvania Governor Tom Wolf issued a statewide <a title="Emergency Declaration" href="https://www.governor.pa.gov/newsroom/all-non-life-sustaining-businesses-in-pennsylvania-to-close-physical-locations-as-of-8-pm-today-to-slow-spread-of-covid-19/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Emergency Declaration</a> that effectively closes all LVC buildings and campus-based operations. The declaration is open-ended. The CDC had previously recommended no gatherings of 50 or more for the next eight weeks. The State Department has issued the highest level <a title="travel alert" href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/traveladvisories/traveladvisories.html/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">travel alert</a> for any and all international travel. Almost all of our study abroad students and faculty conducting international research have returned or are returning to the U.S. Social distancing is still the only effective safeguarding measure and we must all participate in slowing and stopping the spread of the virus for the benefit of the communities of which we belong. LVC will do its part.</p>
<p><strong>I am announcing with this letter that all classes for the spring semester will be taught remotely, including final exams. LVC will not resume any campus-based instruction, campus-based residency, or campus-based student activity for the spring semester.</strong> This includes athletic competitions, student performances, research presentations, exhibitions, and recognitions. We will, however, work intensively to develop alternative and virtual means of designing presentations and recognition. I know you will have many questions. Please see the below information for more details. </p>
<p>For seniors, this leaves the question of Commencement. There is no current information to suggest that there will be any positive change in policies and practices around social distancing by May 9. <strong>I can fully commit to you that <span style="text-decoration: underline;">we will have a Commencement ceremony at some date in the future</span>. Regrettably, I must inform you that we will not have a traditional Commencement Ceremony on May 9.</strong> Personally, I would like nothing better than to hand out diplomas in person, to send you off with my fondest best wishes for your future. Instead, our challenge is to work together to create an alternative plan for recognition. I am convinced that we can–with your contribution of ideas–find ways to honor the seniors and recognize student accomplishments. On Monday, I intend to get started on this commitment.</p>
<p>We are definitely going to get through this crisis. This is a moment in time and, for all of us, an invitation to demonstrate compassion and kindness toward one another, to retain our optimism while being realistic. The LVC signature is the close, respectful relationships we build between faculty and student, student and student, and among all of us. This must now become a virtual signature as well. Everyone is part of this learning community. We expected to continue remote instruction with the simplest organization of efforts, to learn as we go, and to refine as we learn. Your questions and ideas will be part of the refinements we make as we go along in all areas of college life.</p>
<p>Thank you for responding so well and flexibly to this urgent and serious situation. I repeat my strong encouragement to spend time each day in self-care, to schedule time for self-care. I am very proud of you and very grateful for each and every one of you.</p>
<p>Warmly,</p>
<p>President Lewis Thayne</p>			</div>

			<h3 class="js-swap accordion_item_heading" data-swap-target=".accordion_item_4" data-swap-group="accordion_group">A Shared Sense of Commitment and Purpose—President Thayne, March 16, 2020</h3>
			<div class="accordion_item_description">
				<p>Dear Colleagues,</p>
<p>Today we venture together into uncharted waters. In the past 72 hours, we have moved all students out of the residence halls, prepared to complete all classes online, and planned to move all offices to online services. Our objective now is to make the conversion from face-to-face instruction and in-person work to fully remote and online—and to make that conversion as seamless as possible, as rapid as possible, and as simple as possible. </p>
<p>From everything I have seen—and considered as a whole —we are prepared. It’s inevitable that there will be bumps in the road, and many unanticipated questions are sure to arise. I am confident we will address these challenges together and learn valuable lessons.</p>
<p>The agility, competence, and determination of so many over the last several days has been incredibly impressive. The College has been able to implement complex and difficult decisions quickly by keeping our students at the center of all our efforts. Our highest priority is the safety and security of our students, of all employees of the College, and of the communities with which we interact.</p>
<p>In this crisis, it is essential that we maintain a shared sense of mission and of community. Ann Hayes, Monica Cowart, and Dave Shapiro will continue to communicate about the logistics of remote learning and working. Starting tomorrow, Molly O’Brien-Foelsch will share with the campus community a once-daily update on COVID-19-related matters. Part of each day’s communication will be an opportunity to acknowledge truly heroic efforts by our colleagues.</p>
<p>I am very proud of what we have done so far. I have no doubt that our response going forward will reflect the resilience and grit, the ethos of care and of determination that characterize the LVC community. Please remember to begin with self-care and to connect (remotely) with your friends and family.</p>
<p>Warmly,</p>
<p>Lewis</p>			</div>

			<div class="accordion_item_description">
				<p>Dear LVC Families,</p>
<p>We recognize that this has been a particularly challenging time for families and students as we all attempt to navigate the implications of the COVID-19 pandemic. Many of us are still trying to process all the sudden changes occurring in Pennsylvania, across the U.S., and around the world. It is in uncertain times like these that you can be even more confident in your decision to have your student attend LVC. I am reaching out to assure you that the College remains committed to offering the first-class education for which we are known. </p>
<p>We have taken immediate action and implemented several measures that will ensure our students have uninterrupted course work and have access to all the academic support services that you expect from LVC. My team has been working around the clock with our faculty and other key campus leaders so that we are ready to address the comprehensive needs of our students as we shift to remote learning on Wednesday. </p>
<p>I would like to share some of the action steps we implemented in the past week so that Wednesday’s transition to online learning will address the needs of our students:</p>
<ul>
<li>Faculty forums occurred last week to identify immediate technology needs and to discuss how all course learning objectives would be met remotely, despite the content area, in case we needed to move teaching online.</li>
<li>We reached out to accrediting bodies and colleges around the U.S. that have already taken their programs online to get direction on how to offer labs and other forms of experiential learning in a potentially new format while preserving learning objectives.</li>
<li>Two intensive trainings are scheduled for Monday, March 16, and Tuesday, March 17, to help our faculty convert all aspects of their courses to online/remote modalities. These trainings include workshops on WebEx, Canvas, VoiceThread, and other technology solutions. Professors also are working individually with instructional designers to create course-specific online content that maximizes student learning outcomes.</li>
<li>We are not just switching to online instruction. We are making all of our academic support services available remotely. This includes tutoring, individual Academic Success appointments, advising, accommodations, transcripts, resume review, mock interviews, library assistance, and all other academic support services. <a href="https://lvc-www.s3.amazonaws.com/files/resources/academic-support-services-3-15-12.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">We are distributing a resource guide to all students, faculty, and families so that everyone knows what steps to take and who to contact to receive the support that is needed on a variety of issues.</a> Since all of our current academic support services will be offered remotely, our students will continue to benefit from the individualized attention that students and families expect from LVC.</li>
<li><strong>The deadline to withdraw from a course or change to/from pass/fail status has been extended to April 29.</strong> This gives students additional flexibility. The best way to reach the Registrar's Office is via email: <a href="mailto:registrar@lvc.edu" target="_blank" rel="noopener">registrar@lvc.edu</a>.</li>
<li>Undergraduate registration is April 15–23. Course schedules and additional details will be made available ahead of time.</li>
<li>We have taken steps to ensure that seniors will not have any graduation disruptions.</li>
</ul>
<p>As always, my office is here to support you and your student. <a href="https://lvc-www.s3.amazonaws.com/files/resources/academic-support-services-3-15-12.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">This resource guide includes contact information for all of our academic student services.</a> If you are unsure about whom to contact to address a specific concern, then please email Beth Julian, assistant dean of student success and retention at: <a href="mailto:julian@lvc.edu" target="_blank" rel="noopener">julian@lvc.edu</a> or <a href="mailto:findyoursuccess@lvc.edu" target="_blank" rel="noopener">findyoursuccess@lvc.edu</a>.  </p>
<p>As circumstances evolve, please know that we are adapting our support services and our instructional techniques accordingly. Frankly, seeing our faculty, staff, and administrators come together this past week to creatively problem solve has shown me the pure strength of the LVC community. </p>
<p>In these difficult times, know that we are here for you and your student. I have never been so proud to be a member of this community. To quote our CIO, Dave Shapiro, in a faculty forum from last week “We are here for you…We’ve got this!” and we promise you that we will continue to put the needs of our students first in everything we do.</p>

			<div class="accordion_item_description">
				<p>Dear LVC Community,</p>
<p>Yesterday, the World Health Organization assessed that COVID-19 is a pandemic. Last night, the U.S. Department of State issued a Level 3 Global Health Advisory (Reconsider Travel), and President Trump addressed the nation about curbing the spread of COVID-19. Today, Governor Tom Wolf <a href="https://www.governor.pa.gov/newsroom/wolf-administration-provides-guidance-to-commonwealth-employees-on-travel-and-large-gatherings/">recommended</a> significant social distancing and no mass gatherings of 250 people or more for two weeks starting tomorrow, March 13, as a proactive measure to prevent sustained community spread of the disease. Given these and other new developments, the Critical Incident Team strongly recommended that Lebanon Valley College move all classes to remote learning from Wed., March 18, until Thurs., April 9. I have accepted their recommendation to protect the health and well-being of our students and follow precautionary measures. During this period, we will evaluate continuously and assess whether or when we will resume face-to-face classes.</p>
<ul>
<li>All in-person classes are canceled Mon., March 16, and Tues., March 17, for faculty to complete preparations for remote instruction. Existing online classes will proceed as planned. <strong>Face-to-face classes are expected to resume on April 14.</strong></li>
<li>Students must vacate residence halls and houses by Sunday, March 15, at 1 p.m. and take all belongings with them.</li>
<li><strong>Clarification as of March 13:</strong> <strong>Only those students who have been approved to remain living on campus past March 15 are permitted to enter campus buildings or facilities. Commuting students and those who live off-campus <em>are not permitted</em> to enter or use campus buildings or facilities until such time as in-person classes resume.</strong></li>
<li>Students will receive instructions from their professors about how to proceed with their courses. Classes will be held through April 29 as planned, and <a href="https://www.lvc.edu/academics/academic-resources/academic-calendar/">our regular final exam schedule remains in effect</a>.</li>
<li>Seniors will graduate on time if they fulfill all course requirements. Students will complete all their academic requirements remotely. Learning outcomes will not change, even though the mode of delivery will. Faculty will assess students according to the outcomes outlined in syllabi.</li>
<li>Student support services, including advising and tutoring, will be available remotely. <a href="https://www.lvc.edu/offices-directories/counseling-services/">Counseling services</a> will be available remotely for in-state students. If you need mental health support, call 717-867-6232 or email falk@lvc.edu.</li>

<p>I am very grateful for the commitment and flexibility of our faculty and staff members, especially the many hours of work and difficult decisions made by our Critical Incident Team. I also want to thank those faculty, staff, students, and parents who emailed their support and guidance. This is an unprecedented time. LVC is a resilient institution. As circumstances change, we will adjust. <strong>What will not change is Lebanon Valley College’s commitment to students</strong>. We will continue to update the below FAQs and communicate regularly.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>

				<p>Dear Campus Community,</p>
<p>As of today, the <a title="CDC coronavirus page" href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Centers for Disease Control & Prevention</a> and the <a title="PA Department of Health coronavirus guidelines" href="https://www.health.pa.gov/Pages/AlertDetails.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PA Department of Health</a> are recommending that colleges and universities without identified cases of COVID-19 in their community remain open. There are no identified cases in our community. <strong>Given this fact and current guidance by public health officials, LVC will continue to deliver classes in-person.</strong> Faculty will maintain office hours and college offices will work their normal schedules. </p>
<p>The COVID-19 situation could change at any moment. Many colleges and universities in Pennsylvania have opted for online-only delivery of courses. We are monitoring the situation closely and have discussed with the Executive Committee of the Board of Trustees options to consider. If we decide to move to online learning, we will communicate this immediately.  </p>
<p>Lebanon Valley College’s critical incident team meets daily to prepare for potential impacts on the College. I encourage you to review the FAQs below and bookmark this page to stay informed of updates. Please direct inquiries about COVID-19 and the College’s preparedness to 717-867-6555 or <a href="mailto:campuswellness@lvc.edu">campuswellness@lvc.edu</a>.  </p>
<p>LVC Live—our admitted student day scheduled for this Saturday, March 14—will take place as planned. It is one of the most meaningful experiences for prospective students and their families. </p>
<p>I expect there will be a need for frequent updates, so please be alert to changes in circumstances. </p>
<p>Sincerely, </p>
<p>President Thayne </p>			</div>

				<p><em>Last update: Wednesday, March 11, 2020</em></p>
<p>The following FAQs outline the actions Lebanon Valley College is taking regarding the novel coronavirus (COVID-19). <strong>There are no reported cases of COVID-19 on the Lebanon Valley College campus, and no one is self-isolating, as of March 11, 2020.</strong> A college-wide team is monitoring the situation and planning for several scenarios should the virus affect campus. The team is following <a title="PA Department of Health coronavirus guidelines" href="https://www.health.pa.gov/Pages/AlertDetails.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PA Department of Health</a> guidelines and regularly monitoring <a title="CDC coronavirus page" href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Centers for Disease Control & Prevention</a>, and <a title="World Health Organization coronavirus information" href="https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019" target="_blank" rel="noopener">World Health Organization</a> information. </p>
<p>A few important items to note:</p>
<ul>
<li>Students: LVC has partnered with WellSpan Health System to provide 24-hour, 7-day-a-week access to a doctor through the convenience of a video appointment using your smartphone, tablet, or computer. If you need medical attention or advice, first <a href="https://www.wellspanonlineurgentcare.org/">visit the WellSpan Online Urgent Care registration page.</a> Use registration code “LVCStudent."</li>
<li>COVID-19 symptoms include fever, fatigue, dry cough, and difficulty breathing. Some may have aches and pains, nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat, or diarrhea. If you have these symptoms, please call Shroyer Health Center at 717-867-6232 before using walk-in services. </li>
<li>Students who need mental health support should visit counseling services in the Shroyer Health Center. Walk-in appointments are Mon.–Fri., 11 a.m. to 1 p.m., and students may also call for appointments (717-867-6232).</li>
<li>Public safety is always available at 717-867-6111. Call 911 in an emergency.</li>
<li>Faculty and staff who experience symptoms or who have come into contact with those experiencing symptoms should contact their primary care physicians. If you have symptoms for more than three days, you must provide LVC human resources with a return-to-work note from your physician clearing you to come back to campus.</li>
<li>Stay home to rest if you are ill.</li>
<li>If you have traveled to a location where COVID-19 has been reported since Feb. 1, 2020, Lebanon Valley College requests that you make the College aware by emailing <a title="Email campus wellness" href="mailto:campuswellness@lvc.edu">campuswellness@lvc.edu</a>. Provide the dates and locations of your travel. We also request you avoid unnecessary travel anywhere the disease has been reported.</li>
<li>PA Dept of Health can be reached at 877-724-3258.</li>
</ul>
<p>The College will continue to provide updates as this situation evolves.</p>
