                        you love, whether that was inside your homes or outside. We also hope that the online
                        learning experience is going well for our entire community.

                     <p>You may have seen that Governor Tony Evers plans to formally issue a “safer-at-home”
                        order that we expect to take effect this week. Though we do not know what the order
                        will entail specifically, the Wisconsin Association of Independent Colleges and Universities
                        (WAICU), our state agency, is seeking exemption language to allow continuation of
                        online learning and other essential functions for colleges and universities.
                     </p>

                        <li>Right now, <strong>the college is open to support students and for core business operations</strong>. Most staff continue to work remotely, with skeleton on-campus work proceeding as
                           necessary, in particular those offices that provide services to students or are critical
                           to keeping operations running smoothly, like IT, Campus Safety, HR and Payroll. There
                           are always one or two senior administrators on campus at all times.
                        </li>
                        
                        <li>All offices are observing recommended social distance guidelines, and many employees
                           are working alternating days to minimize in-person interactions.
                        </li>
                        
                        <li>At current point, no employees are prohibited from coming to campus, but we urge care
                           and consultation if you are coming in or would like to.
                        </li>

                     <p>We are in the midst of a very new and different way of being, and the Administrative
                        Council and campus leaders are being deliberate about the best way to do this, consulting
                        appropriately. We are in continual contact with our colleagues around the country
                        and those at the Milwaukee Health Department, and we are following all guidelines
                        from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and World Health Organization.
                        Additionally, WAICU is working with the Governor’s office to ensure that the essential
                        work of educating students and keeping individuals employed – while keeping people
                        safe and healthy – are at the forefront of all decisions being made.

                     <p>Finally, many of you have asked how you can continue to support our students. Here

                     <p><strong>The Food Pantry</strong> will now be open every week, and students can pick up an order <strong>every other week</strong>.&nbsp;Students must complete an order form at <a href="https://alverno.wufoo.com/forms/food-pantry-request/">https://alverno.wufoo.com/forms/food-pantry-request/</a> before picking up. We anticipate that demand for the food pantry will increase in
                        coming weeks, so there are bins in the Commons Lobby and Christopher Hall Lobby to
                        collect non-perishable items.

                  <p><strong>A letter from Alverno President Andrea Lee, IHM</strong></p>
                  
                  <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"></span>Dear Alverno College community,
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>Like our peers in Milwaukee and all over the globe, we have been monitoring the quickly
                     evolving outbreak of respiratory illness caused by a novel coronavirus (COVID-19).<br> <br> To date, March 11, there are no confirmed cases of COVID-19 at Alverno and no Alverno
                     students are currently studying abroad. The first priority in managing our response
                     to this situation is to focus on the health and safety of our students, faculty and
                     staff. Our next priorities are to ensure that teaching and learning will continue
                     in a meaningful way; to ensure continuity of college business and services to the
                     greatest extent possible; and to ensure frequent communication with our community.<br> <br> We have decided to extend spring break by one week. <strong>No classes will be held, in person or online, between March 16 and March 20 at 4 p.m.</strong> A decision will be made early next week about graduate classes for the evening of
                     March 20 and all classes beyond March 20.<br> <br> This will allow all faculty to prepare classes to be offered online in the event
                     that on-ground courses do not resume March 24. Faculty will receive additional information
                     shortly about preparing courses to go online.&nbsp;<br> <br> We recognize that some within our community may not have access to technology off
                     campus, and we are developing a mechanism by which you will be able to communicate
                     this with us.&nbsp;<br> <br> All other Alverno administrative and business operations remain open, including the
                     Early Learning Center, Campus Safety, the Library and the Computer Center. Alverno
                     staff should report to campus as usual. On-campus events will be evaluated on a case-by-case
                     basis, and notification of any rescheduling will be done as quickly as possible.<br> <br> Additionally:<br> •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Housekeeping and Dining Services have heightened their cleaning efforts based
                     on industry standards related to the coronavirus. In addition, as a preventive measure,
                     you will see slight modifications in Dining Services to reduce the likelihood of shared
                     utensils, condiment dispensers, etc.<br> •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Residence hall students who have traveled elsewhere for spring break are
                     asked to remain off campus. If this is not possible, students may return to their
                     residence hall. Dining Services options will be limited during this extended spring
                     break time.<br> •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Students who work on campus are excused from work during this extended break;
                     however, student employees who would like to work may do so. Students should contact
                     their supervisors.<br> •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; College-sponsored travel will be determined on a case-by-case basis by the
                     appropriate vice president.<br> •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We will make short-term study abroad decisions soon and in consultation with
                     the host countries, the World Health Organization and the faculty leading these courses.<br> <br> As this situation evolves, campus decisions are being led by the Incident Response
                     Team and Counseling and Health Services, in consultation with the President’s Office
                     and Administrative Council. These groups will continue to meet regularly and to rely
                     on information from the Milwaukee Health Department, the Centers for Disease Control
                     and Prevention, and the WHO.<br> <br> As a college community, we must hold true to our values during this time. It is important
                     that fear resulting from the situation never be turned toward individuals or groups
                     based on race, country of origin or other factors. Additionally, we have a special
                     responsibility to those who are far from home who are concerned for loved ones at
                     risk and who may be at risk and be the least likely to have a local network of support.
                     I know that we will all remember to support one another during this time.<br> <br> Finally, the CDC recommends the following measures to help prevent the spread of
                     all respiratory viruses:<br> •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Avoid close contact with those who are ill<br> •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Avoid touching your face<br> •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stay home when you are sick<br> •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue, then throw the tissue into the
                     garbage<br> •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Clean and disinfect objects and surfaces using household cleaning spray or
                     wipes<br> •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after
                     going to the bathroom; before eating; and after blowing your nose, coughing or sneezing<br> <br> Please visit the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-nCoV/summary.html">CDC website</a> for the most up-to-date information on COVID-19.<br> <br> In the meantime, Alverno will continue to communicate updates in a timely manner
                     to students, faculty and staff. Please also continue to monitor alverno.edu/coronavirus.<br> <br> Be well,<br> <br> Andrea Lee, IHM<br> President, Alverno College
