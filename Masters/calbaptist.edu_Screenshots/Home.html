                  <p><strong>CBU to resume some classroom instruction for 2020 Summer Session 2</strong></p>
                  
                  <p>California Baptist University plans to resume limited face-to-face classroom instruction
                     for the 2020 Summer Session 2, officials announced today.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>The notice from the CBU Executive Council comes after the university transitioned
                     all academic programs to remote instruction and shifted many employees to working
                     from home during the spring 2020 semester. That unprecedented move followed an order
                     by the Riverside County Public Health Officer to close all schools, colleges and universities
                     in the county in response to the coronavirus pandemic.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>The closure order for colleges and universities was rescinded May 9, 2020, permitting
                     CBU to schedule a limited number of in-person classes for Summer Session 2 starting
                     June 29.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>CBU plans to reopen student housing and continue face-to-face instruction for the
                     fall semester. A university task force is developing plans and recommendations to
                     welcome students for classroom instruction during Summer Session 2 as well as for
                     the fall terms.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>“Our top priority is to provide a safe environment for students and employees as they
                     return to campus,” said Kent Dacus, CBU vice president for enrollment and student
                     services.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>“Students are looking forward to a vibrant campus experience and we look forward to
                     welcoming all of our new and returning students,” Dacus said.

                  <p><strong>NOTICE TO CALIFORNIA BAPTIST UNIVERSITY EMPLOYEES</strong></p>
                  
                  <p>We are excited to announce that California Baptist University will begin welcoming
                     students back to campus to attend the second term of the summer semester in face to
                     face classroom instruction which begins June 29.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>We are also excited to welcome back employees that have been working remotely. It
                     is anticipated that offices will be open June 8 and moving toward full capacity to
                     support the return of students and resumption of face to face instruction.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>As restrictions imposed during the coronavirus pandemic are being relaxed, places
                     of employment across California are opening operations almost daily. CBU recognizes
                     the special service of employees who continued working on campus since March, covering
                     essential duties and responsibilities during the closure.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>Offices have been cleaned, hand sanitizing stations, individual hand sanitizers and
                     employee face covers have been ordered, and additional cleaning products will be available
                     for personal workspaces. We are asking that employees respect others by maintaining
                     appropriate social distancing. Additionally, we ask that all employees use a face
                     covering in common spaces and when interacting with others.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>As CBU moves to resume full capacity operations on campus, supervisors will continue
                     to provide guidance concerning duties, responsibilities and work location.

                  <p><strong>Message from President Ellis re: Fall Semester</strong></p>
                  
                  <p>Dear Lancers,</p>
                  
                  <p>We have reached the end of an academic year unlike anything ever experienced!</p>
                  
                  <p>On behalf of the California Baptist University faculty, staff and administration,
                     I want to express our admiration for your outstanding Lancer Spirit amid the unprecedented
                     challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic. Of all the lessons learned this year, flexibility,
                     patience and perseverance arguably mark the CBU experience as never before.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>I am greatly encouraged to report that returning students are registering for fall
                     classes at even greater numbers than last year. We are eager to see them all next
                     semester as we also welcome new first-year and transfer students into the Lancer Nation.
                     As always, CBU is committed to help you Live Your Purpose!
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>Still, I am sure you and your family have many questions. The main question on many
                     minds is simply this: will the CBU campus be open for education this fall?
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>I want you to know that we are doing everything in our power to be ready to welcome
                     students to our beautiful campus in August—not virtually, but in person! To reopen
                     the campus, however, we need to be coronavirus safe. This includes developing plans
                     for testing, tracing, and containment, as well as new spacing, food service delivery
                     options and enhanced safety guidelines for campus activities.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>While there is considerable uncertainty in the battle against this global health crisis,
                     we are nevertheless planning to face the challenges that lie ahead. This spring, I
                     created a task force to develop comprehensive plans for returning to classroom instruction
                     in the fall 2020 semester. We will share details as soon as possible.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>I assure you we will continue working diligently to ensure a safe campus environment.
                     Until there is a vaccine, few places in the world will be coronavirus free. We do
                     not know when new waves of COVID-19 may occur, or what health and travel restrictions
                     may be enacted. And any number of reasons—ranging from student and employee safety
                     to State of California public health directives and the potential for a coronavirus
                     resurgence—may necessitate other options.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>If significant health and safety risks require, we will be prepared to shift decisively
                     and nimbly to a different scenario than we now envision. We look forward to reopening
                     California Baptist University and enjoying the vibrant campus experience once again.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>May the Lord continue to bless!</p>

                  <p><strong>Millions in financial aid helps thousands of CBU students</strong></p>
                  
                  <p>California Baptist University (CBU) has distributed more than $3.4 million in emergency
                     financial aid grants to thousands of students under a provision of the federal CARES
                     Act designed to help students affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>The CBU-administered grants were made possible by the Higher Education Emergency Relief
                     Fund (HEERF) established pursuant to Section 18004(a)(1) of the CARES Act.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>In April, CBU was awarded $7,913,118 from HEERF with the requirement that no less
                     than 50% of those funds be distributed to students as emergency financial aid grants.
                     As of April 30, 2020, the university had disbursed $3,471,200 of emergency financial
                     aid grants to students. CBU also set aside more than $485,000, the remaining HEERF
                     balance, to fund supplemental grants to students who demonstrated higher need.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>The estimated total number of students at CBU potentially eligible to receive the
                     emergency financial aid grants is 7,116. The university reports 6,380 students received
                     an Emergency Financial Aid Grant under the CARES Act.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>The emergency grant amounts that CBU students received were determined by a formula
                     that incorporated Department of Education guidelines, Pell Grant eligibility, and
                     the Expected Family Contribution (EFC) calculated in FAFSA applications submitted
                     for the 2019/20 academic year.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>CBU sent notices by email to eligible CBU students about how the grants were being
                     disbursed and provided updates to its public website.
                  </p>

                  <p><strong>CBU planning to be open for fall 2020 classes</strong></p>
                  
                  <p>California Baptist University is “prepared and planning” to reopen for the fall 2020
                     semester, officials announced today.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>The notice from the CBU Executive Council comes nearly one month after the university
                     transitioned all academic programs to remote instruction. That unprecedented move
                     followed an order by the Riverside County Public Health Officer to close all schools,
                     colleges and universities in the county in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>The closure order currently is set to expire June 19.</p>
                  
                  <p>CBU is planning to reopen student housing at its Riverside campus and resume on ground
                     classes for the fall semester. The notice comes one week after CBU announced creation
                     of a task force to develop plans and recommendations to safely reopen the campus when
                     closure orders are eased or expire.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>“We are hearing from many students that they are eager to return to campus and we
                     are eager to welcome them—returning students and new students alike,” said Kent Dacus,
                     CBU vice president for enrollment and student services.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>“CBU is prepared and planning to ensure a safe environment for students, employees
                     and visitors once the campus reopens,” Dacus said.

                  <p><strong>Task force to plan reopening CBU campus after coronavirus closure</strong></p>
                  
                  <p>California Baptist University has created a task force to develop plans to reopen
                     the CBU campus once COVID-19 restrictions are eased or lifted.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>President Ronald L. Ellis, Ph.D., announced the task force April 16, following a meeting
                     of the CBU Executive Council, consisting of the CBU president and vice presidents.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>The CBU campus has been closed to the public since March 13 under an order from the
                     Riverside County Public Health Officer, shutting down all public and private schools,
                     colleges and universities until April 30. The closures later were extended until June
                     19.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>Ellis said the task force will recommend steps to help ensure safe conditions as students,
                     employees and guests return to the CBU campus.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>Leon Phillips, director of safety services, and Anthony Lammons, dean of students,
                     will serve as task force co-chairs. The group will include representatives from Academic
                     and Student Services, Facilities and Planning Services, Residence Life, Food Services,
                     Information and Technology Services and other essential areas.

                  <p>Remote instruction at California Baptist University will continue at least through

                  <p>The CBU announcement on April 2 followed an order by Riverside County Public Health
                     Officer Dr. Cameron Kaiser, extending closure of the county’s schools to June 19 in
                     response to current conditions of COVID-19.

                  <p>The CBU campus remains closed to the public with all academic programs transitioned
                     to remote instruction after all public and private schools, colleges and universities
                     initially were ordered on March 13 to close until April 30. Today’s extension will
                     include all locations until June 19.

                  <p>California Baptist University continues to monitor the developments of the novel coronavirus

                     and events that are planned for the next 30 days will go on as scheduled. This includes
                     all CBU athletic events.&nbsp; Currently, the only exception is Grandparents Day, which
                     has been canceled.

                  <p>CBU understands this is a fluid situation and university leadership from across campus
                     is convening regularly to monitor developments and identify steps that may be needed
                     in the foreseeable future. As with any crisis that can change quickly and without
                     warning, the university’s response to COVID-19 will be flexible, thorough and evidence
                     based.

                     individuals and those suffering from severe underlying health conditions seem to be
                     at risk of developing more serious effects of the virus.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>The CDC states: “For the majority of people, the immediate risk of being exposed to
                     the virus that causes COVID-19 is thought to be low. There is not widespread circulation
                     in most communities in the United States.”
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>The risk of contracting the virus is higher for people in places where ongoing community
                     spread of the virus has been reported. Individuals who have come into close contact
                     with persons with the COVID-19 and travelers returning from restricted areas are also
                     at an elevated risk of exposure. The risk of contracting COVID-19 is strongly correlated
                     to location of an outbreak.

                  <p>The CDC recommends <span><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/downloads/workplace-school-and-home-guidance.pdf">practicing vigilant hygiene measures</a></span> in addition to avoiding contact with sick individuals to avoid the transmission of
                     the disease.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>To help implement these recommendations, CBU will conduct deeper cleans on campus,
                     particularly in student housing areas, eateries and classrooms. Additionally, there
                     is a food delivery program for students as needed. Please contact Student Services
                     at 951.343.4217 for more information or to request a delivery. CBU is also in the
                     process of ordering a large supply of non-perishable food as precautionary measure.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>University leadership also urges faculty members, staff and students to stay home
                     if they are feeling ill. Here are some recommendations from the CDC on how you monitor
                     your symptoms:
                  </p>
                  
                  <ul>
                     
                     <li>Symptoms compatible with COVID-19 include fever, cough or difficulty breathing.</li>
                     
                     <li>If people feel feverish or develop a cough or difficulty breathing, they should take
                        their temperature, self-isolate, limit contact with others, and seek advice by telephone
                        from a healthcare provider to determine whether medical evaluation is needed.
                     </li>
                     
                  </ul>
                  
                  <p>In a worst-case scenario, CBU has identified quarantined housing areas for students
                     who have either been confirmed to carry the COVID-19 or suspected of coming in contact
                     with a person with the COVID-19.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p><strong>Travel Restrictions</strong></p>
                  
                  <p><strong>Update: 3/14/2020:</strong></p>
                  
                  <p><a id="Travel restrictions 3-17-20"></a>California Baptist University is committed to the continued health and safety of all
                     employees, particularly considering the spread of the COVID-19 coronavirus domestically
                     and internationally. In response to this rapidly developing situation, new travel
                     policies have been implemented to minimize the impact of the virus spread on CBU.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>Effective immediately, all business-related travel by any CBU employee to any domestic
                     or international destination for the purpose of attending off-campus events, including
                     but not limited to conferences or seminars, is now prohibited. This travel policy
                     shall remain in effect at least through June 30, 2020. This restriction applies to
                     any off-campus activities, including continuing education events and scholarly presentations.
                     Any exceptions to this policy must be approved in advance by the president and area
                     vice president. Routine, necessary local travel for system operations, such as secondary
                     site clinical work, procurements, couriers, etc., will continue as scheduled.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>Any cancellation costs incurred by the implementation of this policy shall be covered
                     by departmental funds. Any employee choosing to disregard this policy, however, shall
                     be ineligible for reimbursement of travel-related expenses from departmental funds.
                     In addition, any required quarantine resulting from such travel shall not be paid
                     unless the employee has paid leave or sick leave hours available.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>Employees should carefully heed the most current CDC guidelines and recommendations
                     when considering personal travel. Should an employee travel to a location that has
                     CDC restrictions and/or to a domestic location experiencing community transmissions
                     of the COVID-19 coronavirus or where a state of emergency is in effect, any required
                     quarantine resulting from such personal travel will not be paid unless paid leave
                     or sick leave hours are available.
                  </p>

                  <p>CBU is closely monitoring the developments of the coronavirus (COVID-19). It is important
                     to note that there are no confirmed cases or suspected cases on campus. The risks
                     associated with catching the COVID-19 in the U.S. are still minimal.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>With that said, CBU is aware of the growing public concerns for the COVID-19. To address
                     concerns, CBU has been in contact with the Riverside County Health Department&nbsp;Center
                     for Disease Control to monitor their responses to the virus. Additionally, CBU is
                     forming a COVID-19 task force that will meet frequently to discuss the developments
                     surrounding the COVID-19. The group will also keep the CBU community aware of the
                     important information associated with the virus.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>CBU is also continuing to enforce travel restrictions for its faculty members, staff

                  <p>As a cautionary measure, CBU would like to keep track of our community’s recent travels.
                     If you have traveled outside the U.S. in the past month or plan to travel abroad,

                  <p><strong>WHAT IS CORONAVIRUS</strong></p>
                  
                  <p>According to the&nbsp;CDC, the COVID-19 virus is a respiratory illness that is spread through
                     human-to-human transmission―including sneezing,&nbsp;coughing or close contact.&nbsp;
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>In reported illnesses, patients have had symptoms such as:</p>
                  
                  <ul>
                     
                     <li>Fever</li>
                     
                     <li>Cough</li>
                     
                     <li>Shortness of breath</li>
                     
                  </ul>
                  
                  <p><strong>CARE</strong></p>
                  
                  <p>Contact the CBU Wellness Center or your healthcare professional if you develop any
                     of these symptoms. Please note that we are experiencing a strong flu season that has
                     similar symptoms. You are more likely to catch the flu than the COVID-19 virus.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>*Preventative measures against respiratory illnesses include:</p>
                  
                  <ul>
                     
                     <li>Flu shot</li>
                     
                     <li>Good hygiene – by washing your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds</li>
                     
                     <li>Avoid close contact with people who are sick</li>
                     
                     <li>Avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth frequently</li>

                  <p>California Baptist University is carefully monitoring the Novel Coronavirus 2019 that
                     originated in China and has spread to numerous other countries including the United
                     States. Public Health information at the local, state and national levels indicate
                     the CBU community currently is not at risk of infection. CBU has suspended travel
                     to China and is identifying members of the campus community who have been in China
                     since the outbreak of the Novel Coronavirus 2019 so that appropriate measures can
                     be taken if needed to limit exposure.
