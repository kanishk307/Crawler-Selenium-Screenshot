	<dd class="accordion-navigation"><a class="btn btn-sm animated-button lincoln-one accordion-nav" href="#panelJune24">+ June 24 Update: Reopening Plan</a>

	<div class="content" id="panelJune24">
	<p>Dear Lincoln University Community,</p>

	<p>I am pleased to announce that the Lincoln University Board of Trustees has approved the University’s plan to welcome you all back to campus for the fall semester. Of course, all plans remain contingent upon the continued reduction in the spread of COVID-19 and the continued use of protocols required to mitigate, monitor, and contain any health risks to our community.</p>

	<p>The reopening plan has three top priorities:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>First and foremost, keeping students, faculty, and staff healthy and safe;</li>
		<li>Offering an excellent Lincoln University education to all students; and</li>
		<li>Managing the University’s resources carefully.</li>
	</ul>

	<p><span style="font-family: inherit;">The reopening plan for the Lincoln University main campus<sup>1</sup> is designed in concert with several guidelines and best practices provided by various sources during the continued threat of the COVID-19 virus. Primary are the <a href="https://www.pa.gov/guides/responding-to-COVID-19/#PhasedReopening" target="_blank">guidelines put forth by Tom Wolf, Governor of Pennsylvania</a>.</span></p>

	<p><span style="font-family: inherit;">Additionally, the Pennsylvania Department of Education (PDE) has issued <a href="https://www.education.pa.gov/Schools/safeschools/emergencyplanning/COVID-19/SchoolReopeningGuidance/HigherEd/Pages/default.aspx" target="_blank">guidelines for reopening post-secondary institutions in the state</a>. The guidelines are designed to determine an institution's preparedness to mitigate and manage risks associated with COVID-19. Each plan to resume in-person instruction must be consistent with state and local orders and must incorporate the minimum requirements and expectations put forth by PDE. Institutions must coordinate with local public health or emergency management officials and have a strategy for monitoring health conditions on campus.&nbsp;</span></p>

	<p><span style="font-family: inherit;">The PDE guidelines require that systems for communicating accurate and timely information on COVID-19 related developments to students, faculty, and staff be in place. Finally, strategies for quarantine and isolation must be in place in the event transmission of the virus occurs on campus or if the county is designated as being in the red phase. Any institution whose reopening plan conforms to these guidelines is deemed ready to resume in-person instruction and other related operations as permitted by the Governor's orders.</span></p>

	<p><span style="font-family: inherit;">Lincoln University has engaged in a two-month planning process designed to incorporate state and national guidelines for reopening. The comprehensive plan is the result of careful work by many in the community and invaluable input from students, faculty, staff, and Board members through conversations, surveys, and forums. I am grateful for the work done by our community to address our top priorities and am pleased to say that the resulting plan exceeds expectations and guidelines put forth by the governor, the PDE, and public health officials.</span></p>

	<p><strong><span style="font-family: inherit;">The Academic Calendar</span></strong></p>

	<p><span style="font-family: inherit;">The academic calendar and course delivery modalities have been adjusted to mitigate the threat of COVID-19. Two major principles are (1) ensuring that the campus is residence-free during peak influenza season (late November through late February) and (2) capitalizing on the use of technology to enhance social distancing and to protect the health and safety of students and faculty who are at the highest risk.</span></p>

	<p><span style="font-family: inherit;">The fall semester will begin <strong>August 17, 2020</strong>, one week earlier than originally scheduled. Campus-based instruction will conclude on <strong>November 20, 2020</strong>. Students will leave campus at the Thanksgiving break and not physically return to campus for the remainder of the fall semester. Classes will resume after the break using only remote technology, including the completion of final exams. To minimize travel during the fall semester and thereby lessen the opportunity to be exposed to the virus, classes will be held on Labor Day and there will be no fall break. The fall semester will end on December 11, 2020, as originally scheduled.</span></p>

	<p><span style="font-family: inherit;">The spring semester will begin on <strong>January 25, 2021, using remote technology</strong>. Students will complete the first four weeks of classes remotely. A scheduled spring break will occur the last week of February and <strong>students will return to campus to resume classes in-person on March 1, 2021</strong>. The semester will end May 20, 2021, and Commencement will be held the following weekend on May 30, 2021.</span></p>

	<p><span style="font-family: inherit;"><strong>The curriculum will be delivered through a highly flexible mix of in-person and remote instruction.</strong> Most courses will be delivered through a synchronous hybrid method where courses will be offered during the scheduled time but both students and faculty have the option to attend either in-person or remotely. Faculty will be permitted maximum flexibility in how they manage this option for students. Additionally, this method will provide students who are unable to return to campus some options for continuing their education remotely.&nbsp;</span></p>

	<p><span style="font-family: inherit;">The changes in the academic calendar will necessitate changes in move-in and new student orientation dates. Instructions regarding these matters will be sent to students in the coming days.</span></p>

	<p><strong><span style="font-family: inherit;">Reducing, Monitoring, Containing COVID-19 Outbreaks on Campus&nbsp;</span></strong></p>

	<p><span style="font-family: inherit;">Several strategies and protocols will be implemented toward reducing the threat of a COVID-19 outbreak during the on-campus sessions as well as plans for monitoring and containing any identified cases. The strategies and protocols draw upon the best information and practices known to date.</span></p>

	<p><span style="font-family: inherit;">These protocols include:</span></p>

	<ul>
		<li><strong><span style="font-family: inherit;">The requirement of face masks and social distancing in all public spaces</span></strong></li>
		<li>Baseline COVID-19 testing for all students returning to the residence halls</li>
		<li>Periodic follow-up COVID-19 testing&nbsp;</li>
		<li>A requirement for a seasonal flu shot for faculty and staff.</li>
		<li>Required daily health questions and temperature checks for all campus members.</li>
		<li>Strict protocols guiding visitors to campus and prolonged off-campus trips</li>
		<li>Enhanced frequency of cleaning protocols in all public spaces including all restrooms</li>
		<li>Ample supplies of cleaning materials and hand sanitizers available in public spaces</li>
	</ul>

	<p><a class="btn btn-sm animated-button lincoln-one orange" href="https://www.lincoln.edu/sites/default/files/pdf/hr/reopening-plan.pdf" target="_blank">View the complete plan</a></p>

	<p>With all of the uncertainty and upheaval that the pandemic has caused in just four months, I know you have been eager to know the plan for returning to a “new normal.” I thank you for your patience as faculty and staff have worked diligently to plan to keep everyone at Lincoln safe and move students forward in their education.&nbsp;</p>

	<p><em><sup>1</sup>The plan for resuming classes at the School of Adult and Continuing Education (SACE) in Philadelphia will be released under a separate announcement.</em></p>

	<p>Sincerely,</p>

	<div class="content" id="panelMay19">
	<p>Dear Lincoln University Community,</p>

	<p>I wish you good health and strength during this global pandemic. Many people across the world have contracted the Covid-19 virus with hundreds of thousands losing the battle. The ancillary economic impact has compounded the crisis for many. These are truly unprecedented times, yet the human spirit endures.</p>

	<p>Current trends in infection rates suggest that the public health measures put in place to reduce community spread of the virus have been effective and many states, counties, and regions have begun to reopen. Pennsylvania's reopening is guided by data on infection rates by counties with most of the state slated to be at some level of reopening by mid-June. If infection rates continue to be controlled, the entire state should resume full operation by late July.</p>

	<p>Given this forecast, Lincoln University is planning to welcome students back to main-campus this Fall. We are planning in the context of best practices designed to protect the health and safety of our community while being mindful of the importance of campus activities for the life of the college.</p>

	<p>Operating the campus in the age of Covid-19 requires that we all enter into a "social exercise" to design a "new normal" for engagement both inside and outside of the classroom. Many believe that our ability to resume an active life is predicated on the social responsibility that each individual accepts for keeping themselves and their community safe.&nbsp;<br />
	We are currently forming working groups of faculty, students, and staff to develop protocols and policies based on best practices for managing the continued public health concerns. Look for more information about the working groups in the coming weeks.</p>

	<p>Of course, these plans are contingent upon continued reductions in the spread of Covid-19 and the state support required to mitigate, monitor, and contain any health risks to our community. The full plan for how the University will manage any potential health risks will be shared with the Lincoln University community very soon.</p>

	<p>Finally, threats of Covid-19 to the global community are being assessed every day. Please know that alternative plans for providing continuity of education for our students are also underway should we receive guidance dictating the need to continue remote instruction. In addition, information regarding the School of Adult and Continuing Education (SACE) is forthcoming.</p>

	<p>Again, I wish you strength and endurance as the world battles the threat of the Covid-19 virus. The Lincoln community has weathered many storms together over its 165-year existence. Together we can survive this current crisis.</p>

	<p>Sincerely,<br />
	Brenda A. Allen<br />
	President</p>

	<div class="content" id="panelMay9">
	<p>Dear Lincoln Employees,</p>

	<p>Governor Tom Wolf has extended the stay-at-home order for Chester County and the Philadelphia region to June 4. Accordingly, Lincoln University’s non-essential faculty and staff will continue working remotely through at least June 4. This operating status will remain in effect until further notice. This extends the previous remote work guidance that was set to expire on May 11, 2020.</p>

	<p>The health and safety of the Lincoln community continue to be our main concern. As a reminder, anyone coming to campus must wear a mask and adhere to health and safety practices while on campus.</p>

	<p>Should you have any questions, please contact the Office of Human Resources at <a href="hr@lincoln.edu">hr@lincoln.edu</a>.</p>

	<p>I thank you for continually adapting and moving our agenda forward even during this uncertain time.</p>

	<p>I’m writing to share with you the latest updates on how we work. Governor Tom Wolf extended the Pennsylvania statewide stay-at-home order to May 8 during the coronavirus crisis. Lincoln University’s non-essential faculty and staff will continue working remotely at least through May 8. This extends the previous remote work guidance that was set to expire on April 30, 2020. Employees with permanent residency in neighboring states should follow guidelines set by their respective states and maintain open communication with supervisors. Please remember to update your auto-reply email message accordingly.</p>

	<p>The health and safety of the Lincoln community is our top priority. As a reminder, anyone coming to campus must wear a mask and adhere to health and safety practices while on campus.</p>

	<p>We ask that you continue to regularly monitor your Lincoln University email and the COVID-19 website, which contains all communications sent to our University community.</p>

	<p>Should you have any questions, please contact the Office of Human Resources at <a href="mailto:hr@lincoln.edu">hr@lincoln.edu</a>.</p>

	<p>We thank you for remaining flexible during this challenging time. Stay safe and healthy!</p>

	<div class="content" id="panelApr9">
	<p>Dear Students,</p>

	<p>The COVID-19 pandemic interrupted our spring semester on campus. To compensate for the disruption, we are in the process of crediting 25% of the meal plan and room charges back to the accounts of students who vacated campus and Thorn Flats by March 22, 2020.</p>

	<p>Applying the 25% credit back to student accounts will reduce any existing balances. In cases where the 25% credit clears an existing balance and leaves a surplus, a refund check or direct deposit in that amount will be issued, except for students on full-scholarship.</p>

	<p>Students may log in to <a href="http://webadvisor.lincoln.edu/">WebAdvisor</a> to view their charges and account balance.</p>

	<p>Students may log in to <a href="https://lincoln.afford.com/">lincoln.afford.com</a> and navigate to “refund preference” to review their selected method of payment.</p>

	<p>For refunds to accounts with a Parent/PLUS Loan, checks will be issued to the address on the PLUS loan application unless the parent has designated the student as the refund recipient. A parent’s address can be changed by notifying <a href="http://www.lincoln.edu/financialaid">Financial Aid</a>.</p>

	<p>Questions regarding COVID-19 refunds may be addressed to <a href="mailto:bursaroff@lincoln.edu">bursaroff@lincoln.edu</a>.</p>

	<p>We will begin to issue refunds on April 27, 2020.</p>

	<p>We appreciate your understanding and flexibility as we implement these changes in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

	<p>Sincerely,</p>

	<p>Brenda A. Allen<br />

	<div class="content" id="panelMar24">
	<p>Dear Lincoln University Community,</p>

	<p>The unprecedented events that surround the COVID-19 pandemic continue to present extraordinary challenges. However, these challenges also present our community with the opportunity to overcome and lead, just as Lincoln has done for 165 years.</p>

	<p>I want to start with positive news about the health and wellbeing of our community because safety is always first on my mind. I am pleased to share that no suspected or confirmed cases of COVID-19 have been reported in the Lincoln University community. Our thoughts continue to be with all those affected with this disease and with all of the healthcare and other essential workers keeping us safe. The University continues to exercise universal precautions as we house approximately 40 students with extenuating circumstances following the closure of all University residence halls.</p>

	<p><strong>Remote Coursework</strong><br />
	For many, the start of remote coursework yesterday ushered in a sense of normalcy and routine while also causing anxiety, especially given the connectivity and technology issues with the learning management system. I encourage students to seek support from their instructors, academic advisors, and the class deans to ensure the successful completion of the semester. I want students to know that we value your partnership, feedback, and patience as we adapt our world-class instruction and student support in new, unfamiliar ways.</p>

	<p>Our dedicated faculty and staff have shown themselves to be responsive, flexible, and creative all while experiencing many pressures related to this rapid transition to alternative modes of instruction. Thank you to the faculty and staff who have worked diligently to move courses and administrative functions to a remote format.</p>

	<p>Faculty and staff remain committed to finding learning solutions that meet the needs of every student; I ask students to prioritize learning, to seek answers, and to persist, because if we stick together we will keep our dear old Orange and Blue moving forward amid truly challenging times.</p>

	<p><strong>Pass/Fail Option</strong><br />
	We continually look for ways to adapt our learning and stay focused on the experience of learning. In acknowledgment of the tumultuous events of this semester, Lincoln University has expanded the existing pass/fail grading option for undergraduate students for spring 2020 only. Any undergraduate student may elect to convert any or all of their courses to pass/fail by submitting the Pass/Fail Petition by the last day of classes on April 17. Learn more and access the petition at the <a href="http://www.lincoln.edu/registrar">Office of the Registrar webpage</a>.</p>

	<p><strong>Employees</strong><br />
	Yesterday, Governor Wolf issued a stay-at-home order for seven counties in Pennsylvania, including Chester. Under Governor Wolf’s order, personnel who are providing life-sustaining services can continue to be deemed essential and are permitted to continue their work, provided they adhere to social distancing guidelines.</p>

	<p>Unless otherwise notified, non-essential employees will continue working remotely through at least April 10. Given the ever-changing orders from federal, state, and local jurisdictions, I urge caution for any employee traveling to campus. If a non-essential employee must come to campus, the employee’s supervisor must follow the instruction on the FAQ page, which includes communicating the urgent and essential need to several senior administrators.</p>

	<p><strong>Senior Week and Commencement</strong></p>

	<p>Based on the information from Governor Wolf and the Centers for Disease Control — and for the health and safety of all participants — Senior Week and Commencement are postponed. I know how special Commencement is for students and their families who expected to celebrate with them in May. We will honor students’ achievements in the months ahead and will have a Commencement. I will share the updated details as they emerge so students and their families have time to prepare for this meaningful and jubilant event.</p>

	<div class="content" id="panelMar15">
	<p><em>Note: This update was sent to alumni on March 15 via email. If you are an alumnus and did not receive it, please update your information by signing up or logging in at <a href="https://giving.lincoln.edu/">giving.lincoln.edu</a>.</em></p>

	<p>Dear Members of the Lincoln University Alumni Community,</p>

	<p>Thank you for your calls and expressions of support as we navigate this uncertain time at our beloved Lincoln regarding the plans for addressing the COVID-19 virus. We are grateful that there are no suspected or confirmed cases of COVID-19 at Lincoln University.</p>

	<p>Lincoln University has two top priorities: the safety of our community and the continuity of academic instruction.</p>

	<p>As of today, the majority of the students have evacuated residence halls for their own safety. Any and all students experiencing an extenuating circumstance (e.g. international travel, out-of-state travel, or a student who is experiencing housing insecurities) have been and will continue to be provided for on campus. I assure you that the students who notify us of extenuating circumstances will be supported.</p>

	<p>The second priority is to continue with academic instruction. After thoughtful discussions and feedback from many stakeholders about Lincoln University’s plans, classes will resume in an alternative format on Monday, March 23. Faculty and staff are working diligently to develop alternative modes of course delivery to meet the instructional needs of every student so that they can complete the semester successfully.</p>

	<p>No decisions have been made for activities past the end of classes, which includes Commencement and Alumni Weekend. We are committed to providing timely updates about these and other events. I ask for you to remain flexible and patient as we make adjustments to new information that is released.</p>

	<p>Thank you all for your outpouring of support. We look forward to the day when it is safe to resume normal operations, and we can’t wait to welcome the students back to campus this fall.

	<p><strong>Lincoln University Announces Proactive Measures to Prevent Spread of Coronavirus </strong></p>

	<p><em>Suspends Face-to-Face Instruction for the Remainder of the Spring Semester</em></p>

	<p>Dear Members of the Lincoln University Community,</p>

	<p>I write to you with important updates. We have been following the Coronavirus (COVID-19) news and are aware that recently many secondary schools and higher education institutions in our area have begun to suspend classes.</p>

	<p>The leadership team is in consultation with public health experts and emergency management to implement procedures that ensure that the Lincoln University community is safe.</p>

	<p>While Lincoln University does not have any confirmed cases of COVID-19 as of now, we are taking every precaution possible to ensure the health and safety of all students, faculty, staff, and visitors to main campus and our University City location.</p>

	<p><strong>Academic Instruction</strong></p>

	<p>Erring on the side of caution, face-to-face academic instruction is suspended immediately for the remainder of the spring semester. Classes are canceled for the remainder of this week. Faculty will use this time to determine the best way to deliver remote modes of instruction. Beginning Monday, March 16, classes will transition to alternate modes of instruction.</p>

	<p>It is important to check your Lincoln University email regularly for the latest updates.</p>

	<p><strong>University Housing</strong></p>

	<p>All students in University housing are required to vacate their rooms by Sunday, March 15, for the remainder of the semester and complete their classwork remotely. We ask that you continue to follow guidance from Centers for Disease Control and your local community. The Office of Residence Life will work with individual students who require assistance. This includes both main campus and Thorn Flats.</p>

	<p><strong>Employees</strong></p>

	<p>Faculty and staff members are expected to report to work to manage the day-to-day administrative operations for the University. <strong><em>We ask that all employees continue to exercise universal precautions to minimize the possibility of spreading the virus. If you are sick, please self-quarantine.</em></strong></p>

	<p>We are working with the Physical Plant to implement further enhanced cleaning procedures at all facilities.</p>

	<p><strong>Events at Main Campus and University City</strong></p>

	<p>In keeping with the CDC’s guidance to limit social distance, the University is taking proactive measures to minimize social contact. All non-essential events and public gatherings with more than 100 expected attendees are prohibited until further notice.</p>

	<p><strong>Travel</strong></p>

	<p>We strongly discourage domestic or international non-essential travel for faculty, staff, or students.</p>

	<p><strong>To summarize, classes are canceled for this week and will resume on Monday in a form decided upon by each instructor. </strong></p>

	<p>Please remember there are some basic steps that you can and should take as an individual during this outbreak:</p>

	<p>1. Wash your hands frequently, with soap and water, for at least 20 seconds; and</p>

	<p>2. Avoid close contact with others if you are feeling sick.</p>

	<p>Lincoln University will do whatever we can to help students complete the spring term successfully. I will be sending more details about how this proactive plan will be implemented, but I wanted to let you know of this decision as soon as possible.</p>

	<p>Please know that these decisions have not been made lightly as our leadership team had lengthy discussions. We are confident that if we pull together, we will see our way through this challenge. Thank you— students, faculty, staff, parents, visitors, alumni, community members, and friends—for your support and patience as we adjust to these new plans.</p>

	<p>I encourage you to check the website and your Lincoln emails frequently. All updates on the University’s response to COVID-19 will continue to be posted on our website, <a href="http://www.lincoln.edu/coronavirus">www.lincoln.edu/coronavirus</a>.</p>

	<p>Sincerely,&nbsp;<br />

	<p><strong>Update: 3/9/20 — Lincoln Suspends All Travel for University Business</strong></p>

	<p>Dear Faculty and Staff:</p>

	<p>As Lincoln University continues to monitor the rapidly evolving situation regarding the novel coronavirus COVID-19, the University’s leadership has agreed that it is in the best interest of the health and safety of our faculty and staff to suspend all non-essential travel for University business effective immediately.</p>

	<p>This means that all official travel for University business for faculty and staff is suspended both internationally and domestically outside of Pennsylvania. This decision will remain in effect until further notice. Our goal is to reduce the risk that anyone at Lincoln University might contract or inadvertently spread the virus.</p>

	<p>In response to this decision, you are encouraged to use remote communications such as Zoom or Skype where appropriate to carry out University business that would otherwise necessitate travel outside of Pennsylvania.</p>

	<p>We understand that this travel suspension will have an impact on your work, however, we take seriously our responsibility to protect every member of the Lincoln community.</p>

	<p>Please continue to visit our Coronavirus update page at <a href="http://www.lincoln.edu/coronavirus" target="_blank">www.lincoln.edu/coronavirus</a> for the latest information as Lincoln University administrators monitor this evolving situation and follow recommendations from the Department of State and the CDC.

	<p><b>Actions for Those Experiencing Symptoms</b></p>

	<p>Students, faculty, and staff should stay away from classes and campus activities if they are feeling sick. Community members who are experiencing a fever, cough, or have difficulty breathing — especially if they have traveled internationally in the last 14 days or been in contact with someone who has — should seek medical care right away. Students on campus should contact the Office of Health Services immediately by calling 484-365-7338. <o:p></o:p></p>

	<p>Faculty and staff with possible exposure to COVID-19 or who experience symptoms should avoid coming to campus and should contact their medical provider immediately for further instruction. <o:p></o:p></p>

	<p><b>Travel </b></p>

	<p>The U.S. Department of State has issued several travel advisories.

	<div class="content" id="panel1b">
	<p>Dear Lincoln University Community,</p>

	<p>As news regarding the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak continues to evolve, we want you to know that we are working closely with the Chester County Health Department and the Pennsylvania Department of Health to monitor COVID-19 conditions and make decisions about the best steps to take concerning the health of our students, faculty, and staff.</p>

	<p>COVID-19 is a respiratory illness that can spread from person to person just like the flu or a cold through the air by coughing or sneezing; through close personal contact, like touching or shaking hands; by touching an object or surface with the viruses on it; and occasionally, through fecal contamination. There are currently no cases of COVID-19 in Chester County or Pennsylvania. At this time, the virus is not spreading in the community, so there is no need to change daily routines.</p>

	<p>We have protocols in place to minimize the spread of illness to our students, faculty, and staff and we are reviewing our emergency preparedness plans in the event of a widespread outbreak that requires more action. We have and will continue to work with the Chester County Health Department to implement plans and protocols quickly. Currently, our custodial crews are performing additional cleanings of classrooms and touch surfaces such as desktops and door handles. We are doing our very best to prevent the spread of illness.</p>

	<p>All students, staff, and families are advised to follow the same practices that help prevent the spread of the flu and other illnesses:</p>

	<ul>
		<li><strong>Wash your hands often with soap and water</strong>, especially after coughing or sneezing. Alcohol-based hand cleaners that are at least 60-95% alcohol are also effective.</li>
		<li>Cover your coughs and sneezes. The main way that the flu spreads is from person to person is in the droplets produced by coughs and sneezes, so it is important to cover your mouth and nose with a tissue or cough/sneeze into your elbow or shoulder, not into your hands.</li>
		<li>Make an appointment to get your <a href="https://www.lincoln.edu/sites/default/files/webform/daily-bulletin/flu%20shot_0.pdf">free flu shot on campus at Health Services</a>.</li>
		<li>Do not share personal items such as drinks, food or utensils.</li>
		<li>Do not attend class if you are sick. Refer to the <a href="https://www.lincoln.edu/student-life/students/student-handbook">Student Handbook</a> for specific attendance policies.</li>
		<li>Sick individuals should remain at home for at least 24 hours after there is no longer a fever or signs of a fever without the use of fever-reducing medicine like ibuprofen or acetaminophen.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Our priority is the health and well-being of students, faculty, and staff. We will remain vigilant with the ongoing situation and will notify you of any additional changes to our strategy to prevent the spread of COVID19.</p>

	<p>We recommend you regularly check Chester County Health Department’s website current information about COVID-19 in Chester County at <a href="https://www.chesco.org/4376/2019-Novel-Coronavirus">https://www.chesco.org/4376/2019-Novel-Coronavirus</a>.</p>
