<p>Bethel University is committed to providing a safe and healthy workplace for all of our student workers. To ensure that, we have developed the following Reopening Plan for Student Workers in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. All student workers are responsible for understanding and complying with all aspects of this plan. We know our community at Bethel is unique. As Christ-followers, we care deeply for each other, our students, and their safety and wellbeing. Together, by adhering to this plan, we can mitigate the potential for transmission of COVID-19 at Bethel and create a safe and welcoming community for our students when they return.&#160;</p>
<p>The COVID-19 pandemic is a fluid situation and circumstances can change quickly. <strong><em>As such, this plan will change as needed.</em></strong> We will provide updates when changes are made. This plan is heavily informed by outside medical experts from the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), the Minnesota Department of Health (MDH), and follows the guidance from Governor Walz.&#160;</p>
<h2>Returning to Work On Campus</h2>
<p>We are excited to announce, consistent with the State of Minnesota&#8217;s direction, that we will begin allowing more student workers back on campus. <strong>To facilitate this, effective immediately, student workers will be allowed to return to campus to work if they are unable to perform their work remotely.</strong></p>
<h2>Screening and Policies for Student Workers Exhibiting Signs &amp; Symptoms of COVID-19</h2>
<p><strong><em>Daily Health Screenings and Accountability</em></strong></p>
<p>Prior to beginning work each day, all student workers must complete a daily online health screen. If the form is not completed or the results show that staying at home is advised, ID card access will be denied for that day.</p>
<p><strong>Daily Screening Process</strong></p>
<p>Complete the daily online <a href="https://www.bethel.edu/covid-19/health-screening/">Health Screening Form</a>. Student workers will be asked two questions regarding their current health status and then asked to attest to their answer.&#160;</p>
<p><em>QUESTION 1: Are you showing any signs of one or more of the following symptoms that are not related to a chronic condition: fever, cough, shortness of breath, chills, muscle pain, sore throat, or loss of taste or smell?</em></p>
<p><em>QUESTION 2: To your knowledge, have you been in direct contact within the last 14 days with someone who has been diagnosed with COVID-19 (clinically or test-confirmed)? Direct contact is defined as being with the person infected for 15 minutes or more at less than 6 feet distance.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>If the answer is NO to both questions, ID card access will automatically be updated as approved to be on campus that day.
<ul>
<li>If entering 3900 via a vehicle, student workers should proceed to the main entrance off of Old Snelling (near the West Parking Lot) and enter through the far-right side, swiping their ID card to gain entry.</li>
<li>If living on campus, student workers should proceed to one of the main buildings to gain entry.</li>
<li>If entering at the Anderson Center, student workers should proceed to the reception desk to gain entry.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If the answer is YES to <strong>one or both questions</strong>, do not come to work and follow the steps below for reporting COVID-19 illness while at home.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><em>Reporting COVID-19 Illness Policy While at Home</em></strong></p>

<p><strong>At a minimum, student workers must stay home until they are fever-free for three consecutive days without fever-reducing medication and ten days since the onset of symptoms.</strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Reporting COVID-19 Illness Policy While at Work&#160;</em></strong></p>
<p>&#160;Student Worker Steps:&#160;</p>
<ol>
<li>Ensure you are wearing a mask.</li>
<li>Inform your supervisor.</li>
<li>Go home immediately. If immediate departure is not possible, you should stay isolated in your department&#8217;s isolation space until a ride home is available.</li>
<li>Complete the <a href="notification-form">Health Services COVID-19 Notification Form</a>. <strong><em>Note that the answers to these questions will only be sent to and stored by Health Services.</em></strong>
<ul>
<li>What are your symptoms?</li>

<li>What locations have you been at Bethel within the last 14 days?</li>
<li>Who have you been in direct contact with at Bethel, i.e., been with for 15 minutes or more at less than 6 feet distance?</li>
</ul>
</li>

</ol>
<p>Supervisor Steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Ensure your student worker is wearing a mask.</li>
<li>Send the student worker home immediately. If immediate departure is not possible, the student worker should stay isolated in your department&#8217;s isolation space until a ride home is available.</li>
<li>Notify human resources at <a href="mailto:bethelhr@bethel.edu">bethelhr@bethel.edu</a>.</li>
<li>Notify facilities management at <a href="mailto:facilities-management@bethel.edu">facilities-management@bethel.edu</a> so that they can properly disinfect the workspace as needed.</li>
<li>Inform your team that a member of your team is out sick, being careful to share only the information your student worker wishes be shared.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>At a minimum, student workers must stay home until they are fever-free for three consecutive days without fever-reducing medication and ten days since the onset of symptoms.</strong></p>
<h2>Communication of Exposure</h2>
<p>If a student worker has been diagnosed with COVID-19 (clinically or test-confirmed), MDH will notify individuals having been identified as direct contacts of a potential exposure and advise about next steps.&#160;</p>
<h2>Health Privacy Policy</h2>
<p>All COVID-19 data collected from the <a href="notification-form">Health Services COVID-19 Notification Form</a> will only be sent to and stored by Health Services. In addition, all HIPAA Privacy and Security Policies will govern the privacy of data shared.</p>
<h2>Student Worker Pay Policies for COVID-19</h2>
<p><strong><em>Caring for Yourself</em></strong></p>
<p>Student workers who are unable to work due to being ill with COVID-19 will be paid at 100% for their regularly scheduled hours. This time must be marked at C-19 on their timesheet, not as regular hours.</p>
<p><strong><em>Quarantine Policy</em></strong></p>
<p>Student workers will not be allowed on campus for 14 days after they have been in direct contact with someone who has been diagnosed with COVID-19 (clinically or test-confirmed). Direct contact is defined as being with the person infected for 15 minutes or more at less than 6 feet distance. All other contact is considered indirect and does not necessitate being quarantined.</p>
<p>If quarantined, student workers must/will:</p>
<ol>
<li>Inform their supervisor.</li>
<li>Work remotely to the degree their position allows.</li>
<li>Be paid at 100% during this time for their regularly scheduled hours.</li>
<li>Record their quarantine time as C19 on their timesheet, not as regular hours.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Accommodations for Vulnerable Persons</h2>
<p>We recognize and support the need to provide accommodations for student workers who are vulnerable to COVID-19 or student workers who live with individuals who are vulnerable to COVID-19. Currently, per the CDC, an individual falls into the vulnerable category if they are over age 65 and/or have one or more of the following conditions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Chronic lung disease or moderate to severe asthma</li>
<li>Serious heart conditions</li>
<li>Immuno-compromised (e.g., cancer treatment, smoking, bone marrow/transplant, immunodeficiencies, prolonged use of steroids or immune-weakening medication)</li>
<li>Severe obesity (BMI 40 or higher)</li>
<li>Diabetes</li>
<li>Chronic kidney disease undergoing dialysis</li>
<li>Liver disease</li>
</ul>
<p>Student workers should contact human resources at <a href="mailto:bethelhr@bethel.edu">bethelhr@bethel.edu</a> if they need an accommodation.</p>
<h2>Hygiene and Respiratory Etiquette</h2>
<p>Practicing basic hygiene and respiratory etiquette has been proven to prevent the spread of COVID-19. It also demonstrates to others our care and concern for their health and wellbeing. While practices such as frequent hand washing or wearing a cloth mask may seem inconvenient to us personally, to those around us, especially to those in the vulnerable category, these are tangible expressions of thoughtfulness for one another.</p>
<p><strong><em>Masks</em></strong></p>
<p>Cloth masks are <strong>required</strong> in public spaces on campus where social distancing measures are difficult to maintain, such as when entering or exiting campus, lounges, hallways, restrooms, etc. In addition, where workstations do not permit at least six feet between individuals, student workers must wear cloth masks at all times. The use of cloth masks is <strong>encouraged</strong> within office suites even if social distancing measures can be practiced.&#160;</p>
<p>Student workers may bring their own cloth mask to work. If student workers need a cloth mask, Bethel will provide up to two per student worker at no cost. Masks can be <a href="https://www.bethel.edu/covid-19/mask-request">requested online through the Campus Store</a>.&#160;</p>
<p><strong><em>Handwashing</em></strong></p>
<p>Student workers are expected to wash their hands for at least 20 seconds with soap and water frequently throughout the day, but especially at the beginning and end of their time on campus, after visiting high traffic locations, prior to any mealtimes, and after using the toilet. Hand sanitizer dispensers are also available and can be used for hand hygiene in place of soap and water if hands are not visibly soiled.</p>
<p><strong><em>Cover Your Cough or Sneeze</em></strong></p>
<p>Student workers are expected to cover their mouth and nose with their sleeve or a tissue when coughing or sneezing and avoid touching their face&#8212;in particular their mouth, nose, and eyes&#8212;with their hands. Tissues should be disposed of in the trash and individuals should wash or sanitize their hands immediately afterward.</p>
<h2>Social Distancing Policy</h2>
<p>To ensure the protection of student workers and students, the following social distancing practices must be followed:</p>
<ul>
<li>Until further notice, meetings must continue to be held virtually if:
<ul>
<li>Social distancing cannot be practiced and/or</li>
<li>The group is larger than 10.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>All meetings must have a virtual or remote call-in option.</li>
<li>Student workers must not gather in groups in confined areas, including elevators.</li>
<li>Student workers must not use anyone else&#8217;s personal protective equipment, phones, computer equipment, desks, cubicles, workstations, offices, or other personal work tools and equipment. There are some situations where Bethel-owned vehicles or work tools must be shared. In those situations, student workers should take precautions to sanitize them between use. These materials will be provided by facilities management.</li>
<li>Common spaces such as break rooms, lounges, huddle rooms, and conference rooms must have furniture rearranged to promote social distancing.&#160;</li>
<li>Break rooms and lunchrooms will be limited to food preparation only. When possible, student workers are encouraged to bring meals that do not require refrigeration or heating.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Cleaning Protocol</h2>
<p>Regular cleaning practices are being enhanced by Bethel, including routine cleaning and disinfecting of work surfaces, equipment, tools, and machinery, and other areas in the work environment. Frequent cleaning and disinfecting will be conducted in areas with highly touched surfaces such as door knobs and handles, classroom furniture, handrails, light switches, vending machines, elevators, and water fountains. Facilities management will also clean public spaces such as building lobbies and restrooms at least once daily, and more frequently if deemed necessary.</p>
<p>Departments will be provided with sanitizing products for shared-use equipment so that they have the ability to disinfect areas, including the following, after each use:&#160;</p>
<ul>
<li>Department reception areas</li>
<li>Break rooms and kitchenettes</li>
<li>Workrooms</li>
<li>Huddle and conference rooms&#160;</li>
<li>Training areas</li>
<li>Circulation areas&#160;</li>
<li>Shared computers, printers, or other technology</li>
<li>Other shared resources</li>
</ul>
<p>All custodial staff and their supervisors have been provided refresher training on proper cleaning techniques, as well as background information on COVID-19. All cleaning products meet U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) requirements. If there is a confirmed positive case reported to Bethel, facilities management will coordinate cleaning and disinfecting of that student worker's work space and other places they have touched or used.</p>
<h2>Communications and Training</h2>
<p>&#160;This plan has been adopted by the Bethel University Cabinet and was first distributed to all student workers on May 28, 2020. It will be updated, as necessary. The most up-to-date version of this plan will remain posted on the <a href="https://www.bethel.edu/covid-19/">COVID-19 Information</a> website.</p>
<p>Additional communication will be ongoing as circumstances surrounding the pandemic require. Supervisors, managers, directors, deans, ELT, and Cabinet are required to monitor how effective the program has been implemented by reporting observations and concerns to their supervisor and Cara Wald, chief human resources and strategy officer, at <a href="mailto:c-wald@bethel.edu">c-wald@bethel.edu</a>.</p>
