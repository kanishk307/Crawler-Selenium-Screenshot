<p><em>It is critical to emphasize that maintaining 6-feet social distancing remains important to slowing the spread of the virus. CDC is additionally advising the use of simple cloth face coverings to slow the spread of the virus and help people who may have the virus and do not know it from transmitting it to others.&nbsp; Cloth face coverings fashioned from household items or made at home from common materials at low cost can be used as an additional, voluntary public health measure.</em><br /><br /><em>For more information, click <strong><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/cloth-face-cover.html">here</a>.</strong></em></p>

<li><em>As the University is open for business, students can report to work but are not required to work if they do not want to.&nbsp;If the student resides&nbsp;in&nbsp;the residence halls, the student must follow University Housing and Dining protocol for requesting to return the week of March 23 (March 22-30).&nbsp;</em></li>

<li><em>If you are designated as an eligible-to-work employee but are unable to report to work because of the lack of childcare, you should notify your supervisor of the need for absence following your department&rsquo;s normal call-in procedures and report time away for work in accordance with University policy.

<li><em>The University has taken a number of steps to limit the risk of exposure to our faculty, staff and students. Employees who are not sick should generally expect to follow existing departmental policy by requesting time off from their supervisor. Approval will be at the supervisor's discretion in order to meet operational needs.</em><br /><br /><em>If you have an underlying health condition and believe that, despite the precautions taken by the University, that you are at risk for exposure by reporting to work, please contact the Human Resources Office at <a href="mailto:benefits@eiu.edu">benefits@eiu.edu</a> to discuss your eligibility for FMLA or an accommodation under the Americans with Disabilities Act.</em></li>
</ul>
<p><em><strong>Will I need a release to return to work if I am off work for five or more consecutive workdays?</strong></em></p>
<ul>
<li><em>The necessity for a return to work will be determined in accordance with the University's Return to Work procedures.</em><br /><br /><em>Please contact <a href="mailto:benefits@eiu.edu">benefits@eiu.edu</a> for questions regarding leave reporting or return-to-work requirements. If an employee is self-isolating, a certification to return to work will be necessary.&nbsp;</em></li>
</ul>
<p><em><strong>Can the University require that I self-quarantine or self-isolate?</strong></em></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Yes, to protect the health and safety of other employees and students, the university can require employees and students to self-isolate. &nbsp;Please discuss specific situations with the supervisor and contact HR with questions related to leave usage.&nbsp; As general guidance, if the employee presents symptoms that are cause for concern, you should send the employee home (with pay) for that day.&nbsp; In order for the employee to return to work, they must present a release from a medical provider that indicates they are clear to return to work.&nbsp; In absence of that return to work certification, the employee would need to utilize sick leave benefits until a return to work authorization can be obtained.</em></li>
