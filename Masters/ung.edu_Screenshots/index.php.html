<p>These essential plans are built on three guiding principles that are designed to support and shape the behavior of our university community. They are:</p>
<ul>
<li>UNG will continue to make the safety of students, faculty and staff its first priority.&#160;</li>
<li>Classes and operations must be able to go between best practices in face-to-face and online delivery for a period during the semester, based on public health information.</li>
<li>Clear and proactive communications regarding planning and implementation processes, operational changes are essential.&#160;</li>
</ul>
<p>Through the remainder of the summer, UNG employees will continue teaching in an online format and employees will begin a staged approach to resume normal campus operations.&#160;</p>

<p>I write today to update you on two important topics&#8212;our plans for fall semester and the state budget process.</p>
<h4>Planning for fall</h4>
<p>Under direction from the University System of Georgia (USG), we have developed plans for fall semester that consider three scenarios: 1) face-to-face instruction with social distancing expectations, 2) fully online classes, and 3) classes and operations would transition to an online format at any point during the semester. This extensive planning effort&#8212;involving more than 140 faculty, staff, and administrators&#8212;has been guided by these principles:</p>
<ul>
<li>The university will continue to make the safety of students, faculty and staff its top priority.;</li>
<li>Classes and operations must be able to go between best practices in face-to-face and online delivery for a period during the semester, based on public health information.</li>
<li>Clear and proactive communications regarding planning and implementation processes and operational changes are essential.</li>
</ul>
<p>All USG institutions plan to resume face-to-face instruction with social distancing expectations this fall, and this will include more hybrid courses and flexible approaches. USG leaders have reviewed our plans, and our workgroups are refining them to clarify institutional practices and processes. I anticipate that we will publish the full plan no later than July 1.&#160;</p>
<p>As UNG begins to operationalize its plans, we are working with the USG to define specific situations that may require the use of face-coverings and appropriate enforcement provisions. We will share those details as they are available. Additionally, we will supply every UNG employee and student with a reusable cloth face-covering and actively promote their use as a best practice for helping to mitigate the spread of <span class="all-caps">covid</span>-19.</p>
<h4>Budget update</h4>
<p>Yesterday, the Georgia State Senate released its version of the FY21 budget, which begins July 1. As anticipated, the Senate proposed an overall operating budget reduction of 11% or $288.7 million for the USG. Unfortunately, no new funds were provided for enrollment growth, maintenance and operations of facilities, health insurance increases, or pay raises.</p>
<p>The legislative process will continue as the budget moves back to the House of Representatives for consideration and eventually back to Governor Kemp for approval. After the budget is approved, we will learn more from the USG regarding our FY21 allocation and the implementation of potential furlough days, the proposed Voluntary Separation Program and other budget reduction measures I have shared previously.</p>
<p>On a positive note, the Senate's version of the capital project budget, which is separate from the operating budget, includes funding for three UNG projects. The projects include: completion of the Gainesville Campus renovations of the former Lanier Tech facility; construction of the Cottrell Center for Business, Technology and Innovation; and the planning and design of the addition to the Cumming Campus building. These are important projects to support UNG's students, faculty and staff, and I am grateful to our legislators for their advocacy.</p>
<p>These past few months have been personally and professionally difficult and stressful for each of us, and the days ahead remain challenging. Thank you for your continued professionalism and support. Most importantly, thank you for your care for one another and our students. I will continue to provide updates as information becomes available.</p>

<p>The COVID-19 pandemic has brought extraordinary challenges, and you have responded with creativity, flexibility and care for one another. The challenges will continue in the coming weeks, particularly as we prepare for employees and students to return to campus.</p>
<p>As I noted last week and as we shared in the <a href="https://video.ung.edu/Playlist/UNG_TownHall_OnDemand?destinationID=0AO4fcoQVkqSlJD_P698KQ&amp;contentID=MR-yorx1cU2zAL1nYnLAnA&amp;pageIndex=1&amp;pageSize=10" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Faculty-Staff Town Hall meeting</a>&#160;(login required) this week, <a href="https://ung.edu/remote-life/employee-return/index.php">UNG&#8217;s Employee Return to Campus Plan</a> includes incremental steps in three phases. A <a href="https://ung.edu/remote-life/_uploads/files/ung-return-to-campus-plan-summary.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank">summary of the plan (PDF)</a> is attached to this message for your reference. Phase 1 is planned to begin June 15 and will involve a <strong>limited return</strong> to campus for approved units. Their priority will be to prepare for the next stages of employee return and our students&#8217; return to campus this fall. In phases 1 and 2, most employees will continue to work remotely fully or on a staggered basis.</p>
<p>Employees who have continued to work on campus during this time should continue to do so. All other employees should not return to campus until receiving direction from their supervisor. We will not have a full return to campus until we reach phase 3.</p>
<p>Many people have asked about work accommodations for those who fall into the Georgia Department of Public Health and CDC categories for higher risk for severe illness with COVID-19. Those employees may request alternate work arrangements, and our Office of Human Resources is developing an electronic form to facilitate that process. In the meantime, you may email that office at <a href="mailto:ada@ung.edu">ada@ung.edu</a> to notify them that you may need accommodations.</p>
<p>The health of our employees and the community remains our top priority. In each phase, leaders in each area will closely with the COVID-19 Planning Team, Emergency Management, and Facilities to ensure that appropriate social distancing and protective measures, including arrangements for appropriate PPE, are in place before staff members begin returning to campus. Supervisors should particularly note this <a href="https://ung.edu/remote-life/employee-return/appendix-a.php">additional guidance</a> and <a href="https://ung.edu/remote-life/employee-return/appendix-e.php">forms</a> to help you in planning and management.</p>
<p>As we have stressed, we will proceed cautiously and with a great amount of flexibility. Our plans will remain fluid and may change based on the latest guidance from the USG, the Governor&#8217;s COVID-19 task force, Georgia Department of Public Health, and CDC. Thank you for your continued commitment to finding creative solutions and your work to ensure the health and well-being of our UNG community.</p>

<p>I know many people are wondering when we will return to campus. Throughout our response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have prioritized the safety of our students, faculty and staff, and we will continue to do so. With that as a guiding principle, our workgroups have developed a plan to transition employees back to campus-based work cautiously and deliberately. This gradual return to campus will occur over three phases, beginning June 15 and continuing over the summer.</p>
<p>This strategy continues to encourage teleworking as much as possible, especially for high-risk personnel, while enabling critical personnel to return to campus to prepare for students&#8217; return in August. The plan&#8217;s recommendations comply with Executive Orders and directives from the Governor&#8217;s Office and reflect guidance from the Georgia Department of Public Health and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, as well as the USG.</p>
<hr/>
<h4>Phase 1:</h4>
<p>Phase 1 will begin June 15. It will be limited in scope and will not end before June 28. The primary task of those returning in Phase 1 is to prepare our campuses for the continued safe return of more members of the university community in Phase 2, ultimately culminating in the full Phase 3 return of faculty, staff and students in August for the Fall Semester. Our efforts will focus on cleaning and preparing campus, and the majority of our community will continue to work remotely. Our facilities teams and others on campus doing this work will be provided with extensive training, personal protective equipment, and other measures to ensure their safety.</p>
<p>Those employees previously defined as essential and who have been working on campus during the period of reduced operations should continue to do so. On a limited basis, supervisors who should return to campus to ensure the work environment they oversee is compliant with health and safety guidelines and staff members who perform mission-critical/time-sensitive functions, as determined by their supervisor, and who need to work onsite may return as necessary. <strong>Employees should not return to campus until they are notified by their unit that they can do so.</strong></p>
<hr/>
<p>Our goals are to protect the health and safety of all our employees and our community while taking the steps within our control to make it more likely that students can return to campus safely this fall semester. Throughout this process, we must remain flexible and adjust our expectations and operations to conform to public health guidance and changing circumstances. As we successfully complete each phase and account for the latest public health information, we will announce guidelines and timing for the next phase.</p>
<h4>Next Steps</h4>
<p>I will host a virtual town hall meeting on Wednesday, June 3, 12:00 - 1:00 p.m., to present our plans and discuss a safe and productive return to campus. You can participate virtually through the link below. Questions should be emailed to <a href="mailto:president@ung.edu">president@ung.edu</a>.</p>

<p>I can share that students are enthusiastically planning to return to campus for fall instruction, and our enrollment is looking strong. Our UNG workgroups, which are composed of dozens of faculty, staff, and administrators from each campus, are developing a plan&#8212;to include multiple contingencies should we have to adjust&#8212;for the 2020-2021 academic year.</p>
<p>Thank you for all you are doing to carry out our mission in this extraordinary situation while prioritizing the safety and success of our students and employees.</p>

<p>I appreciate so many of you participating in the virtual Town Hall Meeting we held last week. I know you continue to have many questions, and I will continue to keep you updated.</p>
<p>As you are aware, the COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on the state&#8217;s economy. This April, state revenues declined by more than $1 billion (or 35.9%) compared to April 2019. With further revenue declines expected, the University System of Georgia (USG) and all state agencies have been asked to prepare budget plans with a target of 14% in reductions for Fiscal Year 2021, which starts July 1. However, nothing will be final until a budget appropriation is approved by the General Assembly and signed by the Governor, and that is expected to happen in June.</p>
<p>Chancellor Wrigley asked us to be strategic as we plan for this reduction at our institution. Included below is UNG&#8217;s proposed budget reduction plan, which includes both temporary and permanent actions that place the greatest priority on our core instructional mission and helping our students complete a college education<strong> I want to reiterate that this is only a plan, and final reductions will be determined in the weeks ahead</strong>.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the USG Board of Regents approved a system-wide furlough plan and guidance for potential staff reductions as part of an overall plan to reduce the state budget by 14% for Fiscal Year 2021.

<p>For UNG, the 14% potential budget reduction equate amounts to $12.1 million. Preliminary calculations show that the proposed five-tier furlough plan would have an impact of about $2.24 million at UNG. As shown below, the plan is based on salary scale and is designed to protect our most vulnerable employees.&#160; If implemented, please know that employee benefits would remain intact.&#160;</p>

<p>Chancellor and Presidents will take <strong>26 furlough days</strong> which equates to 10% reduction.</p>
<p>We still need to identify nearly $10 million more for our budget reduction plan. Our budget team has already begun working on this, and we will be considering freezing vacancies, reducing travel and operating budgets&#8212;including summer utility savings from reduced operations, and, potentially, early retirement opportunities. Reductions in force will be a last resort as we strive to make strategic reductions that support our ability to serve students and fulfill our mission.&#160;</p>
<p>I understand this is troubling information, on top of stress you may already be experiencing due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the disruptions we have all experienced. Your Faculty Senate and Staff Council leaders will be involved in my discussions with cabinet leaders next week as we navigate these very challenging decisions.&#160;This is still a planning process and will likely evolve;&#160;I pledge to keep you informed as our plans progress.</p>

<p>The Board of Regents for the University System of Georgia (USG) provided authority Thursday for a plan for possible staffing reductions and furloughs due to rapid changes in expected state revenue caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>USG is working now with its 26 colleges and universities to develop a new spending plan for fiscal year 2021 that includes a 14% reduction from the current fiscal year.</p>
<p>Any action related to staffing reductions and furloughs will be based on the final budget appropriation to be approved in June. The Board&#8217;s approval allows institutions and the system office to respond to the state&#8217;s request for a plan to reduce spending by 14% starting July 1.</p>
<p>While this may include difficult decisions, the system&#8217;s top priority continues to be helping students complete a college education. USG remains grateful to all its employees for making a difference at a critical time for the University System, including keeping institutions and the University System Office (USO) accessible and responsive during this extraordinary time.</p>
<p>The Board&#8217;s guidance, to be reflected in each campus plan, requires faculty and staff at all 26 USG colleges and universities as well as the USO to take a minimum number of days of unpaid time off depending on their salary range, with the exception of those with the lowest base salaries. For most employees, this means either 4 furlough days or 8 furlough days, depending on their salary. Those with the highest base salaries will be required to take 16 furlough days, or the equivalent of a 6.2% pay reduction.</p>
<p>In addition, the Chancellor and all Presidents at every USG institution will take the equivalent of a 10% pay reduction which includes 26 furlough days for fiscal year 2021.</p>
<p>USG institutions and the USO may also need to adjust staffing levels to meet operational needs and address the immediate impact of revenue and funding losses. These plans, including the number of impacted employees, will be unique to each institution.</p>
<p>&#8220;Employees of the University System of Georgia and our 26 colleges and universities continue to show resilience and dedication despite facing uncertainty and unprecedented challenges during the COVID-19 pandemic,&#8221; USG Chancellor Steve Wrigley said. &#8220;Their work has been instrumental in supporting not only USG&#8217;s 333,000 students, but thousands of Georgians across the state. I deeply appreciate the contributions of our employees impacted by these measures, and ask all of us to show our respect, compassion and gratitude for their service to our students.&#8221;</p>
<p>Institutions have already experienced changes to campus operations caused by COVID-19, including a move to remote instruction and the departure of thousands of students from campuses, which has had an immediate negative impact on auxiliary operations and finances.</p>
<p>USG will continue to monitor the financial impact of COVID-19 and adjust as circumstances require. The system also continues to implement cost-cutting measures. These include a Comprehensive Administrative Review that will reduce administrative costs system wide by more than $100 million and a critical hire process that was implemented in December 2019.</p>
<p>While remote instruction will continue through summer, on-campus classes are tentatively expected to restart in the fall. A final decision will be based on guidance from the Georgia Department of Public Health and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</p></div>

<p>As you are aware, the COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on our economy. Earlier today, state leaders announced that all state agencies, including the University System of Georgia (USG), should plan to reduce their budgets by 14% for Fiscal Year 2021, which begins July 1. It is important for you to know that, at this point, this is a planning figure only. We hope that the impact on UNG will be partially mitigated by state funding based on our enrollment growth and federal stimulus funds.</p>
<p>The USG will provide additional direction in the days ahead on system-wide elements of the budget reduction plan. Institution-level plans will also be required. I will be working internally with institutional leaders, including representatives of the Faculty Senate and Staff Council, to develop strategic institutional budget reduction plans for submission to the USG by mid-May. Our goal will be to sustain the academic mission of the institution while minimizing, as much as possible, the impact on personnel.</p>
<p>I know this news generates many questions for you. We will have more information to share at our Town Hall meeting on May 14, and I will provide updates as they become available in the interim. These are unprecedented events that will test our ingenuity and our resourcefulness, and I am grateful for your continued patience and support.</p>

Kemp&#8217;s Coronavirus Task Force and the Georgia Department of Public Health (DPH) this afternoon. This two-week timeframe, which encompasses UNG&#8217;s Spring Break scheduled for the week of March 23, will give us time to test our business continuity plans and online instruction modules and for state officials to continue to assess the current situation regarding coronavirus in Georgia.&#160; At UNG, this suspension of instruction includes all face-to-face and online courses.</p>
<p>While instruction is temporarily suspended for this two-week period, UNG will continue to operate. However, in-person services may be limited, as offices are encouraged to telework during this period. Students and consumers should review information on the UNG website for details. Employees should consult with their supervisors regarding expectations of essential personnel and teleworking opportunities.&#160;</p>
<p>Any decision to alter operations or move classes online beyond March 29 will be determined by the University System of Georgia in consultation with the Georgia Department of Public Health.</p></div>
