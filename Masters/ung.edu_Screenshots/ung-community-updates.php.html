<p>I write today to update you on two important topics&#8212;our plans for fall semester and the state budget process.</p>
<h4>Planning for fall</h4>
<p>Under direction from the University System of Georgia (USG), we have developed plans for fall semester that consider three scenarios: 1) face-to-face instruction with social distancing expectations, 2) fully online classes, and 3) classes and operations would transition to an online format at any point during the semester. This extensive planning effort&#8212;involving more than 140 faculty, staff, and administrators&#8212;has been guided by these principles:</p>
<ul>
<li>The university will continue to make the safety of students, faculty and staff its top priority.;</li>
<li>Classes and operations must be able to go between best practices in face-to-face and online delivery for a period during the semester, based on public health information.</li>
<li>Clear and proactive communications regarding planning and implementation processes and operational changes are essential.</li>
</ul>
<p>All USG institutions plan to resume face-to-face instruction with social distancing expectations this fall, and this will include more hybrid courses and flexible approaches. USG leaders have reviewed our plans, and our workgroups are refining them to clarify institutional practices and processes. I anticipate that we will publish the full plan no later than July 1.&#160;</p>
<p>As UNG begins to operationalize its plans, we are working with the USG to define specific situations that may require the use of face-coverings and appropriate enforcement provisions. We will share those details as they are available. Additionally, we will supply every UNG employee and student with a reusable cloth face-covering and actively promote their use as a best practice for helping to mitigate the spread of <span class="all-caps">covid</span>-19.</p>
<h4>Budget update</h4>
<p>Yesterday, the Georgia State Senate released its version of the FY21 budget, which begins July 1. As anticipated, the Senate proposed an overall operating budget reduction of 11% or $288.7 million for the USG. Unfortunately, no new funds were provided for enrollment growth, maintenance and operations of facilities, health insurance increases, or pay raises.</p>
<p>The legislative process will continue as the budget moves back to the House of Representatives for consideration and eventually back to Governor Kemp for approval. After the budget is approved, we will learn more from the USG regarding our FY21 allocation and the implementation of potential furlough days, the proposed Voluntary Separation Program and other budget reduction measures I have shared previously.</p>
<p>On a positive note, the Senate's version of the capital project budget, which is separate from the operating budget, includes funding for three UNG projects. The projects include: completion of the Gainesville Campus renovations of the former Lanier Tech facility; construction of the Cottrell Center for Business, Technology and Innovation; and the planning and design of the addition to the Cumming Campus building. These are important projects to support UNG's students, faculty and staff, and I am grateful to our legislators for their advocacy.</p>
<p>These past few months have been personally and professionally difficult and stressful for each of us, and the days ahead remain challenging. Thank you for your continued professionalism and support. Most importantly, thank you for your care for one another and our students. I will continue to provide updates as information becomes available.</p>
<p>Sincerely,<br/>Bonita <br/><br/>Bonita C. Jacobs, Ph.D.<br/>President</p></div>

<p>The COVID-19 pandemic has brought extraordinary challenges, and you have responded with creativity, flexibility and care for one another. The challenges will continue in the coming weeks, particularly as we prepare for employees and students to return to campus.</p>
<p>As I noted last week and as we shared in the <a href="https://video.ung.edu/Playlist/UNG_TownHall_OnDemand?destinationID=0AO4fcoQVkqSlJD_P698KQ&amp;contentID=MR-yorx1cU2zAL1nYnLAnA&amp;pageIndex=1&amp;pageSize=10" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Faculty-Staff Town Hall meeting</a>&#160;(login required) this week, <a href="https://ung.edu/remote-life/employee-return/index.php">UNG&#8217;s Employee Return to Campus Plan</a> includes incremental steps in three phases. A <a href="https://ung.edu/remote-life/_uploads/files/ung-return-to-campus-plan-summary.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank">summary of the plan (PDF)</a> is attached to this message for your reference. Phase 1 is planned to begin June 15 and will involve a <strong>limited return</strong> to campus for approved units. Their priority will be to prepare for the next stages of employee return and our students&#8217; return to campus this fall. In phases 1 and 2, most employees will continue to work remotely fully or on a staggered basis.</p>
<p>Employees who have continued to work on campus during this time should continue to do so. All other employees should not return to campus until receiving direction from their supervisor. We will not have a full return to campus until we reach phase 3.</p>
<p>Many people have asked about work accommodations for those who fall into the Georgia Department of Public Health and CDC categories for higher risk for severe illness with COVID-19. Those employees may request alternate work arrangements, and our Office of Human Resources is developing an electronic form to facilitate that process. In the meantime, you may email that office at <a href="mailto:ada@ung.edu">ada@ung.edu</a> to notify them that you may need accommodations.</p>
<p>The health of our employees and the community remains our top priority. In each phase, leaders in each area will closely with the COVID-19 Planning Team, Emergency Management, and Facilities to ensure that appropriate social distancing and protective measures, including arrangements for appropriate PPE, are in place before staff members begin returning to campus. Supervisors should particularly note this <a href="https://ung.edu/remote-life/employee-return/appendix-a.php">additional guidance</a> and <a href="https://ung.edu/remote-life/employee-return/appendix-e.php">forms</a> to help you in planning and management.</p>
<p>As we have stressed, we will proceed cautiously and with a great amount of flexibility. Our plans will remain fluid and may change based on the latest guidance from the USG, the Governor&#8217;s COVID-19 task force, Georgia Department of Public Health, and CDC. Thank you for your continued commitment to finding creative solutions and your work to ensure the health and well-being of our UNG community.</p>
<p>Sincerely,<br/>Bonita</p>

<p>I know many people are wondering when we will return to campus. Throughout our response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have prioritized the safety of our students, faculty and staff, and we will continue to do so. With that as a guiding principle, our workgroups have developed a plan to transition employees back to campus-based work cautiously and deliberately. This gradual return to campus will occur over three phases, beginning June 15 and continuing over the summer.</p>
<p>This strategy continues to encourage teleworking as much as possible, especially for high-risk personnel, while enabling critical personnel to return to campus to prepare for students&#8217; return in August. The plan&#8217;s recommendations comply with Executive Orders and directives from the Governor&#8217;s Office and reflect guidance from the Georgia Department of Public Health and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, as well as the USG.</p>
<hr/>
<h4>Phase 1:</h4>
<p>Phase 1 will begin June 15. It will be limited in scope and will not end before June 28. The primary task of those returning in Phase 1 is to prepare our campuses for the continued safe return of more members of the university community in Phase 2, ultimately culminating in the full Phase 3 return of faculty, staff and students in August for the Fall Semester. Our efforts will focus on cleaning and preparing campus, and the majority of our community will continue to work remotely. Our facilities teams and others on campus doing this work will be provided with extensive training, personal protective equipment, and other measures to ensure their safety.</p>
<p>Those employees previously defined as essential and who have been working on campus during the period of reduced operations should continue to do so. On a limited basis, supervisors who should return to campus to ensure the work environment they oversee is compliant with health and safety guidelines and staff members who perform mission-critical/time-sensitive functions, as determined by their supervisor, and who need to work onsite may return as necessary. <strong>Employees should not return to campus until they are notified by their unit that they can do so.</strong></p>
<hr/>
<p>Our goals are to protect the health and safety of all our employees and our community while taking the steps within our control to make it more likely that students can return to campus safely this fall semester. Throughout this process, we must remain flexible and adjust our expectations and operations to conform to public health guidance and changing circumstances. As we successfully complete each phase and account for the latest public health information, we will announce guidelines and timing for the next phase.</p>
<h4>Next Steps</h4>
<p>I will host a virtual town hall meeting on Wednesday, June 3, 12:00 - 1:00 p.m., to present our plans and discuss a safe and productive return to campus. You can participate virtually through the link below. Questions should be emailed to <a href="mailto:president@ung.edu">president@ung.edu</a>.</p>

<p>I can share that students are enthusiastically planning to return to campus for fall instruction, and our enrollment is looking strong. Our UNG workgroups, which are composed of dozens of faculty, staff, and administrators from each campus, are developing a plan&#8212;to include multiple contingencies should we have to adjust&#8212;for the 2020-2021 academic year.</p>
<p>Thank you for all you are doing to carry out our mission in this extraordinary situation while prioritizing the safety and success of our students and employees.</p>

<p>I appreciate so many of you participating in the virtual Town Hall Meeting we held last week. I know you continue to have many questions, and I will continue to keep you updated.</p>
<p>As you are aware, the COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on the state&#8217;s economy. This April, state revenues declined by more than $1 billion (or 35.9%) compared to April 2019. With further revenue declines expected, the University System of Georgia (USG) and all state agencies have been asked to prepare budget plans with a target of 14% in reductions for Fiscal Year 2021, which starts July 1. However, nothing will be final until a budget appropriation is approved by the General Assembly and signed by the Governor, and that is expected to happen in June.</p>
<p>Chancellor Wrigley asked us to be strategic as we plan for this reduction at our institution. Included below is UNG&#8217;s proposed budget reduction plan, which includes both temporary and permanent actions that place the greatest priority on our core instructional mission and helping our students complete a college education<strong> I want to reiterate that this is only a plan, and final reductions will be determined in the weeks ahead</strong>.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the USG Board of Regents approved a system-wide furlough plan and guidance for potential staff reductions as part of an overall plan to reduce the state budget by 14% for Fiscal Year 2021. Please remember that any actions related to furloughs and staffing reductions will be based on the final state budget appropriation, which will be determined in June.&#160;</p>
<p>For UNG, the 14% potential budget reduction equate amounts to $12.1 million. Preliminary calculations show that the proposed five-tier furlough plan would have an impact of about $2.24 million at UNG. As shown below, the plan is based on salary scale and is designed to protect our most vulnerable employees.&#160; If implemented, please know that employee benefits would remain intact.&#160;</p>

<p>Chancellor and Presidents will take <strong>26 furlough days</strong> which equates to 10% reduction.</p>
<p>We still need to identify nearly $10 million more for our budget reduction plan. Our budget team has already begun working on this, and we will be considering freezing vacancies, reducing travel and operating budgets&#8212;including summer utility savings from reduced operations, and, potentially, early retirement opportunities. Reductions in force will be a last resort as we strive to make strategic reductions that support our ability to serve students and fulfill our mission.&#160;</p>
<p>I understand this is troubling information, on top of stress you may already be experiencing due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the disruptions we have all experienced. Your Faculty Senate and Staff Council leaders will be involved in my discussions with cabinet leaders next week as we navigate these very challenging decisions.&#160;This is still a planning process and will likely evolve;&#160;I pledge to keep you informed as our plans progress.</p>

<p>The USG Board of Regents met this morning and approved a recommendation for potential furlough days as part of the previously announced 14% state budget reduction planning process. Because the legislature and governor have not yet approved the Fiscal Year 2021 budget, this information is preliminary and is subject to change based on the final budget.

<p>The Board of Regents for the University System of Georgia (USG) provided authority Thursday for a plan for possible staffing reductions and furloughs due to rapid changes in expected state revenue caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>USG is working now with its 26 colleges and universities to develop a new spending plan for fiscal year 2021 that includes a 14% reduction from the current fiscal year.</p>
<p>Any action related to staffing reductions and furloughs will be based on the final budget appropriation to be approved in June. The Board&#8217;s approval allows institutions and the system office to respond to the state&#8217;s request for a plan to reduce spending by 14% starting July 1.</p>
<p>While this may include difficult decisions, the system&#8217;s top priority continues to be helping students complete a college education. USG remains grateful to all its employees for making a difference at a critical time for the University System, including keeping institutions and the University System Office (USO) accessible and responsive during this extraordinary time.</p>
<p>The Board&#8217;s guidance, to be reflected in each campus plan, requires faculty and staff at all 26 USG colleges and universities as well as the USO to take a minimum number of days of unpaid time off depending on their salary range, with the exception of those with the lowest base salaries. For most employees, this means either 4 furlough days or 8 furlough days, depending on their salary. Those with the highest base salaries will be required to take 16 furlough days, or the equivalent of a 6.2% pay reduction.</p>
<p>In addition, the Chancellor and all Presidents at every USG institution will take the equivalent of a 10% pay reduction which includes 26 furlough days for fiscal year 2021.</p>
<p>USG institutions and the USO may also need to adjust staffing levels to meet operational needs and address the immediate impact of revenue and funding losses. These plans, including the number of impacted employees, will be unique to each institution.</p>
<p>&#8220;Employees of the University System of Georgia and our 26 colleges and universities continue to show resilience and dedication despite facing uncertainty and unprecedented challenges during the COVID-19 pandemic,&#8221; USG Chancellor Steve Wrigley said. &#8220;Their work has been instrumental in supporting not only USG&#8217;s 333,000 students, but thousands of Georgians across the state. I deeply appreciate the contributions of our employees impacted by these measures, and ask all of us to show our respect, compassion and gratitude for their service to our students.&#8221;</p>
<p>Institutions have already experienced changes to campus operations caused by COVID-19, including a move to remote instruction and the departure of thousands of students from campuses, which has had an immediate negative impact on auxiliary operations and finances.</p>
<p>USG will continue to monitor the financial impact of COVID-19 and adjust as circumstances require. The system also continues to implement cost-cutting measures. These include a Comprehensive Administrative Review that will reduce administrative costs system wide by more than $100 million and a critical hire process that was implemented in December 2019.</p>
<p>While remote instruction will continue through summer, on-campus classes are tentatively expected to restart in the fall. A final decision will be based on guidance from the Georgia Department of Public Health and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</p></div>

<p>As you are aware, the COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on our economy. Earlier today, state leaders announced that all state agencies, including the University System of Georgia (USG), should plan to reduce their budgets by 14% for Fiscal Year 2021, which begins July 1. It is important for you to know that, at this point, this is a planning figure only. We hope that the impact on UNG will be partially mitigated by state funding based on our enrollment growth and federal stimulus funds.</p>
<p>The USG will provide additional direction in the days ahead on system-wide elements of the budget reduction plan. Institution-level plans will also be required. I will be working internally with institutional leaders, including representatives of the Faculty Senate and Staff Council, to develop strategic institutional budget reduction plans for submission to the USG by mid-May. Our goal will be to sustain the academic mission of the institution while minimizing, as much as possible, the impact on personnel.</p>
<p>I know this news generates many questions for you. We will have more information to share at our Town Hall meeting on May 14, and I will provide updates as they become available in the interim. These are unprecedented events that will test our ingenuity and our resourcefulness, and I am grateful for your continued patience and support.</p>

<p>We are drawing near the end of the most unusual spring semester ever, and I don&#8217;t think any of us could have imagined the extraordinary level of disruption we have experienced. With instruction moved online, employees teleworking, and traditional events canceled or conducted virtually, our campuses have been strangely quiet during what is one of our most active times of the year. Yet, despite our physical separation, the UNG community has pulled together with a powerful shared commitment to our students and to one another. Our focus has remained on our mission of educating students, and there are many, many examples of faculty and staff members who have conducted exceptional work to support their continued success. Thank you!</p>
<p>As an update to the federal <span class="all-caps">CARES</span> Act funds, we disbursed more than $3.32 million to 11,292 spring semester students Tuesday. Additionally, 1,085 students have applied for UNG <span class="all-caps">CARES</span> Emergency Grants and those grants will be disbursed this week. The UNG Foundation is also providing emergency funds to students who are ineligible for CARES funding. This is an important step to provide aid to our students facing financial challenges and to help them remain enrolled.</p>
<p>We have been fortunate to be able to continue to pay all UNG employees under the current circumstances, but I know that some in our UNG family may be facing financial hardship based on employment changes in their household. While we are unable to use Foundation support to provide aid to employees, I want to remind you that our UNG Food Pantries are operating on all campuses, including Blue Ridge now, and that this service is available to staff and faculty, as well as students. I encourage you to take advantage of this as needed. For service hours and details, see the &#8220;<a href="operations-updates-cancellations.php#dir-section-F">Food Pantry Operations Updates</a>&#8221;.</p>
<p>All of us are eager to resume normal operations, and we have begun a planning process for a staggered, phased-in approach to do so as soon and as safely as possible. However, there are many questions still to be answered. I have established six broad groups and numerous sub-groups to develop plans for a smooth transition to full operations at UNG. These working groups will address workplace and health safety, instruction, research, outreach and continuing education, student life, enrollment management, athletics, communications, and fiscal impact. The groups are being led by senior administrators and involve nearly 140 members of our faculty and staff.</p>
<p>We expect to receive additional guidance from the USG on these challenging issues. Our top priority in this gradual reopening over the summer is the safety of our faculty, staff and students. Our plans must promote a healthy and safe environment, and comply with directives from the Governor&#8217;s Office and guidance from the Georgia Department of Public Health. Conditions permitting, our plan is to resume in-person instruction for fall semester in August. However, please understand that this situation remains fluid, as guidance is subject to change, even after our plans are put in place. We still have much work to do in the days and weeks ahead, and I will continue to keep you updated on our progress. I have scheduled another virtual Town Hall meeting for faculty and staff on Thursday, May 14 at noon, and we will share additional details soon.</p>
<p>Finally, I want to let you know that we are planning a virtual celebration in honor of our spring graduates on May 8 through our <a href="https://ung.edu/commencement/index.php">Commencement website</a>. Now through May 8, I encourage you to post congratulatory photos and short videos on Twitter and Instagram with the hashtags #UNG20grad and #UNGremotegrad as a way to show our support for our graduates. These messages and videos will be collected on the Commencement site starting May 8.</p>
<p>I know many of you are juggling an array of professional and personal responsibilities in this unusual environment. Thank you for your patience and flexibility over the past several weeks and in days to come.<br/><br/>Stay well,<br/>Bonita<br/><br/>Bonita C. Jacobs, Ph.D.<br/>President</p></div>

<p>UNG is committed to doing everything in our power to help our students overcome academic and financial barriers on their paths to graduation. To this end, the university will use resources from the federal Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (<span class="all-caps">CARES</span>) Act and the UNG Foundation to assist students during this difficult time.</p>
<p>UNG will use $6.8 million in<span class="all-caps"> CARES</span> Act funding to provide <a href="ung-cares-program.php">UNG <span class="all-caps">CARES</span> Program</a> grants&#160;to eligible students currently enrolled for spring semester who have experienced educational disruptions due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The funds will begin to be disbursed automatically to eligible students beginning April 28. Similar grants will also be available to students who continue their enrollment in summer semester.</p>
<p>Students who are facing specific hardships may apply for the UNG <span class="all-caps">CARES</span> Emergency Grant to receive up to $700 in additional assistance. Information and the link to apply for these grants are available at&#160;<a href="http://go.ung.edu/ung-cares">http://go.ung.edu/ung-cares</a>. The Emergency Grant applications will be reviewed and placed on student accounts daily.&#160;</p>
<p>Each student must&#160;select a <a href="https://www.refundselection.com/refundselection/#/welcome/continue" rel="noopener" target="_blank">refund preference</a>&#160;to receive UNG <span class="all-caps">CARES</span> funds in a timely manner. Failure to complete this process will delay receipt of the funds for a minimum of 14 days. For additional information and assistance, visit the&#160;<a href="https://ung.edu/financial-aid/index.php">Office of Financial Aid</a>&#160;or&#160;<a href="https://ung.edu/business-office/index.php">Business Office</a>&#160;webpages. You may also contact the Office of Financial Aid at&#160;<a href="mailto:finaid@ung.edu">finaid@ung.edu</a>&#160;or the Business Office at&#160;<a href="mailto:business.office@ung.edu">business.office@ung.edu</a>.</p>
<p>In addition, counselors in the&#160;<a href="https://ung.edu/student-money-management-center/index.php">Student Money Management Center</a>&#160;are available to advise students on how they can access other resources, including financial coaching and debt management.</p>
<p>For those students who are not eligible for<span class="all-caps"> CARES</span> Act funding, please know that the UNG Foundation is partnering with UNG&#8217;s Office of Financial Aid and the Student Money Management Center to provide additional resources to assist with emergency needs. Please contact the Student Money Management Center or Office of Financial Aid for assistance.</p>
<p>The $6.8 million that UNG is receiving and awarding through <span class="all-caps">CARES</span> Act funds will not be sufficient to address all of the hardships faced by UNG students. Still, we hope that the various resources UNG is providing will reduce the burdens faced by a number of you.&#160;We understand how stressful and challenging this time is, and we appreciate your patience as we navigate these difficult times together.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Bonita Jacobs<br/>President</p></div>

<p>Previously, fully online students paid a differential that helped fund the development of online courses.&#160; Moving forward, the online tuition fee for undergraduate programs will be the same as the regular in-state per credit hour rate for associate- and bachelor&#8217;s-degree students.&#160; The exception is eCore courses, which will remain at $159 for all undergraduate students.&#160; There are no tuition changes for graduate students.&#160;&#160;</p>
<p>Additionally, the Board of Regents has reduced all mandatory fees for summer semester to only the institutional fee and technology fee, both of which may be prorated based on your credit hour registration.&#160; You may use the "<a href="https://ung.edu/business-office/tuition-and-fees/index.php">Semester Estimator"</a>&#160;or <a href="https://ung.edu/business-office/tuition-and-fee-charts.php">tuition and fee charts</a> for planning purposes.&#160;&#160;</p>
<p>Please note that we have canceled some courses planned for face-to-face instruction that we are unable to transition online.&#160; Faculty have adapted all other courses for online delivery.&#160; UNG has added alternative online offerings that will be available for registration via your Banner Nighthawk Course Scheduler on Wednesday, April 15.&#160;&#160;</p>
<p>Further, there will be no tuition increases when we resume face-to-face instruction in the fall for the 2020-2021 academic year.&#160; This decision by the Board of Regents allows the USG, including UNG, to offer some of the lowest tuition rates among peer higher education systems.&#160; We understand these are challenging times for you and your families, and we are taking all possible steps to support your continued educational success and progress.&#160;</p>
<p>We anticipate summer semester invoices will be populated and distributed on Friday, April 17.&#160; Be sure to monitor your student email account for that information.&#160; Details about payment deadlines and Nelnet Payment Plan information, along with FAQs, are on the&#160;<a data-auth="NotApplicable" href="https://ung.edu/business-office/index.php" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">business office</a>&#160;and&#160;<a data-auth="NotApplicable" href="https://ung.edu/remote-life/learning/index.php" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">UNG Remote Life</a>&#160;webpages.&#160; Please direct any questions to&#160;<a data-auth="NotApplicable" href="mailto:business.office@ung.edu" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">business.office@ung.edu</a>.</p>

Kemp&#8217;s Executive Order includes an exception that enables USG institutions, including UNG, to continue distance learning and performing other essential functions. UNG faculty, staff and students can conduct Necessary Travel for these purposes. When there are necessary in-person operations, we must implement measures, as outlined in the order, to mitigate the exposure and spread of COVID-19.&#160; To meet those mitigation requirements, UNG Facilities will curtail routine services to all UNG campuses next week.&#160; However, the facilities staff will respond to any emergency needs for space cleaning or maintenance of building systems.&#160; During this period, please call Public Safety at 706-864-1500 to report any emergency maintenance needs.</span><span>&#160;</span></p>
<p><span>Effective Monday, April 6, we will institute UNG&#8217;s Summer Hours, under which staff members work 9 hours, Monday through&#160;</span><span>Thursday</span><span>, and 4 hours on Fridays.&#160; Our goal in implementing this early is to provide you additional flexibility.&#160; I recognize that each of you faces different circumstances and demands in working remotely.&#160; If, during this time, you need greater schedule flexibility, please coordinate with your supervisor.</span><span>&#160;</span></p>
<p><span>Non-Closure Emergency Leave will continue to be available, as needed, to ensure that eligible employees receive their regular compensation.&#160; Additionally, the Office of Human Resources will send information about new benefits available as a result of the Families First Coronavirus Response Act, which includes a provision for emergency paid sick leave and an expansion of Family Medical Leave Act (FMLA) coverage.</span></p>
<p><span>I know that the instability of the past few weeks has touched each of us and that yesterday&#8217;s announcement from the USG that we would continue remote instruction through summer semester presents additional challenges.&#160; Thank you for what you are doing to support our students and one another.&#160; I hope you will take a moment to review the message that I sent to them earlier and the new&#160;<a data-auth="NotApplicable" href="https://ung.edu/remote-life/index.php" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">UNG Remote Life website</a>&#160;with resources for learning, teaching and working remotely.</span><span>&#160;</span></p>
<p><span>As I noted in our Faculty-Staff Town Hall meeting earlier this week, it is the best of times and the worst of times.&#160; The communities where our campuses are located are experiencing community spread of COVID-19.&#160; We continue to prioritize the safety of our students, faculty and staff as we do our part to help stem the spread of the coronavirus in Georgia and fulfill our missions of education, leadership development, service, and research.&#160; I am grateful to each of you for your dedication, your service, and your leadership.</span><span>&#160;</span></p>

<p class="x_MsoNormal"><span>I understand that this is a stressful time for you and that the move to online learning may create additional challenges. I am deeply appreciative of your cooperation and understanding as we endeavor to work through a very difficult and extraordinary situation.&#160; One of the concerns we have heard from many of you is that students may not have reliable access to internet or computers.&#160; To support our students and ensure a successful transition to online, we are surveying students to identify and help address such concerns.&#160; We are also in the process of establishing a student outreach system that keeps them connected to the university.</span><span>&#160;</span></p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal"><span>Next week, UNG campuses will maintain</span><span>&#160;reduced operations, and, with controlled exceptions, all employees who can work remotely should continue to do so and not come to campus unless it is absolutely essential.&#160; Supervisors may continue to use non-closure emergency leave as needed to support those employees whose roles do not allow them to work remotely.&#160; If you do need to come to campus, please be sure to have your key or ID card to gain entry, as most facilities will be locked due to minimal staff on-site.</span><span></span><span>&#160;</span></p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal"><span>The Library Technology Center in Dahlonega will be open to UNG students, faculty and staff Monday-Friday, 10 a.m. to 2 p.m., and our libraries will offer remote services (research consultations, instruction, chat etc.) from 8 a.m. to 5:30 p.m., Monday-Thursday, and 8 a.m. to 3 p.m. on Friday.</span><span>&#160;</span></p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal"><span>We will have limited Postal Services and Logistical Services operations with scheduled times for departments to pick up mail and packages and drop off outgoing mail as necessary for continuity of operations.&#160; You may contact Charlotte Wade at&#160;<a data-auth="NotApplicable" href="mailto:charlotte.wade@ung.edu" id="LPlnk955944" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">charlotte.wade@ung.edu</a>&#160;for coordination of these services.</span><span>&#160;</span></p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal"><span>We will consolidate our scheduled spring semester town hall meetings for faculty and staff into a single, virtual meeting on Wednesday, April 1, at noon.&#160; We will send you the link and instructions for participating in that meeting early next week.</span><span>&#160;</span></p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal"><span>Our business continuity plan continues to evolve as we adapt to the challenges presented by the COVID-19 pandemic. Times like these test our resolve and creativity, and I remain impressed by the resilience and innovation I see across our university. Thank you for your understanding, your support, and the daily contributions you make to the success of UNG and our students.</span></p>

<li class="x_MsoNormal"><span>According to Centers for Disease Control&#160;and Prevention (CDC) guidelines, it is mandatory for those who have been exposed to a person who has tested positive for COVID-19 to self-quarantine for 14 days from the date of notification.</span></li>
<li class="x_MsoNormal">Health officials are taking precautionary measures to quickly identify cases of COVID-19 and take appropriate public health action to reduce its spread and protect the public in identifying potential contacts.&#160; The best prevention measures for any respiratory virus, including COVID-19, are:
<ul>
<li class="x_MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle"><span>Adhere to social distancing practices and CDC guidance regarding groups and group activity.</span></li>
<li class="x_MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle"><span>Wash your hands often with soap and warm water for at least 20 seconds. If soap and water are not available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer.</span></li>
<li class="x_MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle"><span>Avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth with unwashed hands.</span></li>
<li class="x_MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle"><span>Avoid close contact with people who are sick.</span></li>
<li class="x_MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle"><span>Stay home when you are sick.</span></li>
<li class="x_MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle"><span>Cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue, then throw the tissue in the trash.</span></li>
<li class="x_MsoListParagraphCxSpLast"><span>Clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces.</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="x_MsoNormal"><span>It is important that each of us pay close attention to our overall health, and to any COVID-19 symptoms that may arise. COVID-19 symptoms are fever, cough and shortness of breath.&#160;If you have had contact with someone who is suspected to have COVID-19 and develop those symptoms, stay home and call your health care provider or local health department right away.&#160;Call before going to a doctor&#8217;s office, emergency room or urgent care center and describe your symptoms.</span></p>

While we are facing new challenges, know that we will do everything in our power to support one another through this unprecedented situation.&#160;</span><span>&#160;</span></p>
<p><span>We are mobilizing student leaders to help as mentors and allies in this transition. I realize that sometimes it is better to talk with someone your age who is facing similar issues than with someone sitting in an office.&#160;In the meantime, please note there are several student resources available at&#160;</span><a data-auth="NotApplicable" href="https://go.ung.edu/coronavirus" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><span>https://go.ung.edu/coronavirus</span></a><span>.&#160; Other helpful links include:</span></p>

Also, SMMC has a limited amount of short-term loans, and you might ask if you qualify. The bottom line is that you are not alone. &#160;The financial crisis is real, and the most important thing for you to do is ask for help. Start with the SMMC who can provide guidance. Because we need staff to telework, there will be limited on-campus presence, but they can be reached at&#160;</span><a data-auth="NotApplicable" href="mailto:smmc@ung.edu" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><span>smmc@ung.edu</span></a><span>&#160;or by phone at 706-867-3308 (Dahlonega) or 678-717-3985 (Gainesville),&#160;</span></p>
<p><span>If you are considering a withdrawal from classes, I encourage you to wait. We are addressing issues that may of concern to you.&#160;</span></p>
<ul type="disc">
<li><span>Some of you have told me you are unsure about being successful online. We know we need to help students adapt to this change and, as much as possible, on an individual basis. We will be sending you details and providing online assistance as to how to manage online classes.&#160;</span></li>
<li><span>I want you to also have full understanding of the financial and academic implications of withdrawal including impact on financial aid, scholarships, and refund policies. In some cases, taking an incomplete is a better option, provided it is available.&#160;</span></li>
<li><span>Please do not make these decisions in haste without talking with an advisor.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>Instruction will delivered remotely, beginning March 30, and employees across our campuses will be teleworking to the extent possible.&#160; Our faculty are working diligently to shift to online instruction and to assemble tools and resources to help you adapt to learning in an online environment, and they will be in contact with about your courses.&#160; Together, we will remain on track to complete spring semester strong.</span></p>
<p><span>I have notified our graduating seniors that the spring commencement ceremonies will be cancelled.&#160; Fortunately, because we have a <a href="https://ung.edu/commencement/index.php">summer commencement ceremony</a>, we are able to invite our spring graduates to participate in ceremonies on Saturday, August 1.&#160; I hope that they and their families and friends will take advantage of that opportunity to honor and celebrate that important milestone.</span><span>&#160;</span></p>
<p><span>For residential students on the Dahlonega Campus, the UNG postal office will be forwarding your mail to your home address.&#160; Please be sure you have the correct address listed in <a href="https://ungssb.ung.edu/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Banner.</a> Also, we are in the process of issuing partial refunds for housing and dining and hope to have them processed on March 31 or soon thereafter.</span><span>&#160;</span></p>
<p><span>Remember that while we may be working and studying remotely, we are still connected.&#160; We will continue to provide regular updates in the days ahead and throughout the semester. If you have questions or need assistance, please reach out to someone. Our offices are providing assistance online, by phone, or by in-person appointments.&#160;</span><span>&#160;</span></p>

<p class="x_MsoNormal"><span>Based on <a href="https://www.usg.edu/coronavirus" rel="noopener" target="_blank">tonight&#8217;s announcement from the USG</a>, students will not be allowed to return to campus until they receive permission from the university, which will be forthcoming soon. Additionally, residence halls will be closed, with minimal exceptions for students unable to return home or who cannot find housing elsewhere. We will make every effort to accommodate those students who are unable to depart campus.</span><span>&#160;</span></p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal"><span>We will send specific instructions to students regarding when they will can return to campus to retrieve their belongings from residence halls. Students will be expected to follow those instructions. &#160;We will provide additional information on refunds for housing, dining, and other services, as we receive additional guidance from the USG.&#160; Students should wait for university officials to contact them.</span><span>&#160;</span></p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal"><span>The university will remain open, with minimal staff physically on-site, to ensure continuity of certain services.</span><span>&#160;</span></p>

This two-week timeframe, which encompasses UNG&#8217;s Spring Break scheduled for the week of March 23, will give us time to test our business continuity plans and online instruction modules and for state officials to continue to assess the current situation regarding coronavirus in Georgia.&#160;</p>
<p>At UNG, this temporary suspension of instruction includes all face-to-face and online courses, but not eCore courses. Any decision to alter operations or move classes online beyond March 29 will be determined by the University System of Georgia in consultation with the Georgia Department of Public Health. Dr. Chaudron Gille has provided guidance to our faculty and academic departments about these preparations.&#160;</p>
<h4>Is UNG still open?</h4>
<p>While instruction is temporarily suspended for this two-week period, UNG will continue to operate. Essential personnel will be on campus, though teleworking across the university will be encouraged to the extent possible.&#160; As a result, students and visitors should be aware that in-person services may be limited and that use of online and digital communications will be expanded. Please visit the UNG Resources section of the <a href="https://go.ung.edu/coronavirus">UNG coronavirus website</a> for emerging details on facilities and services.</p>
<h4>Employee Expectations</h4>
<p>Employees should consult with their supervisors regarding expectations of essential personnel and teleworking opportunities. Our IT department has created a <a href="https://ung.edu/information-technology/remote-work-toolbox.php">Remote Work Toolbox</a> that provides essential support to help you be successful. We have also expanded the Employee FAQs on <a href="https://go.ung.edu/coronavirus">UNG&#8217;s coronavirus website</a> to include USG guidance about leave, travel and student workers, and we will add to that as more information becomes available. Please consult with your supervisors or the Office of Human Resources as needed.</p>
<h4>Will campus activities be cancelled?</h4>
<p>From March 16 through March 29, campus-based student activities will be canceled. Other events may be evaluated and changed on a case-by-case basis. Please review the <a href="https://calendar.ung.edu/mastercalendar/MasterCalendar.aspx">UNG Event Calendar</a> or contact event organizers for updates.&#160;</p>
<p>Please note that, as of today, the NCAA and Peach Belt Conference have cancelled all remaining regular season competitions and championships.</p>
<h4>Stay Informed</h4>
<p>Information continues to develop rapidly and may change with minimal notice as conditions evolve. We encourage everyone to regularly visit <a href="https://go.ung.edu/coronavirus">https://go.ung.edu/coronavirus</a> for updates, including those made this afternoon.&#160;</p>
<p>The health of our students, faculty and staff is our highest priority. We will continue to work with USG leaders in collaboration with state officials and DPH to act on the most up-to-date guidance available. In the meantime, I encourage you to lean on one another for support and ask for help as needed &#8211; we are in this together.</p>

<p>This afternoon the University System of Georgia (USG) issued guidance to temporarily suspend instruction at all USG institutions for two weeks, beginning March 16, 2020. It is important for you to know, there are no known cases of COVID-19 among the UNG community. This decision was made after receiving new guidance from Gov. Kemp&#8217;s Coronavirus Task Force and the Georgia Department of Public Health (DPH) this afternoon. This two-week timeframe, which encompasses UNG&#8217;s Spring Break scheduled for the week of March 23, will give us time to test our business continuity plans and online instruction modules and for state officials to continue to assess the current situation regarding coronavirus in Georgia.</p>
<p>We know that you have many questions based on this rapidly evolving news. Our university&#8217;s leadership is working to address these questions and make the necessary arrangements to implement the USG&#8217;s guidance, and we will share more information as it becomes available. In the interim, please note the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Friday, March 13 is a normal class day and operational day for UNG. Students are expected to attend class and personnel are expected to report for work as scheduled.</li>
<li>The guidance to temporarily suspend instruction for two weeks includes face-to-face courses and existing online courses, excluding eCore. This will provide our faculty and staff important time to ensure the operation of online instruction should that become necessary.</li>
<li>The USG guidance indicates that students should vacate residence halls by the end of Friday, March 13, and remain away from campus until March 29. However, we know there are students who are unable to go home or secure alternative accommodations easily. We will make accommodations for those students to safely remain on campus and have access to essential services, including the dining hall.</li>
<li>Campus-based student activities will be canceled during this two-week period.</li>
<li>As many of you may already have Spring Break travel plans, we encourage all students, faculty and staff who may be traveling in any capacity (either domestically or internationally) to register their travel information through UNG's<span>&#160;</span><a href="https://studioabroad.ung.edu/index.cfm?FuseAction=Abroad.ViewLink&amp;Parent_ID=0&amp;Link_ID=7C689562-5056-BA1F-74C1540C18F8ED96" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Office of Global Engagement International Travel Registry<img alt="new window" height="9px" src="https://ung.edu/_uploads/images/content/OpenNewWindowIcon.png" title="link opens in new window" width="11px"/></a>. As a reminder, the CDC strongly advises against anyone traveling to a location subject to a Level 3 or higher Travel Health Notice, including most of Europe, South Korea, China and Iran. We also encourage community members to check with the U.S. Department of State website, and talk with family and travel companions to make a wise decision about travel plans, particularly related to travel in Europe.</li>
<li>Gov. Kemp has suspended all non-essential professional travel for state workers.</li>
</ul>
<span>Finally, prevention is paramount, and the best prevention measures for any respiratory virus, including COVID-19 are:</span><br/>
<ul>
<li>Wash your hands often with soap and warm water for at least 20 seconds. If soap and water are not available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer.</li>
<li>Avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth with unwashed hands.</li>
<li>Avoid close contact with people who are sick.</li>
<li>Stay home when you are sick.</li>
<li>Cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue, then throw the tissue in the trash.</li>
<li>Clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces.</li>
</ul>
<span>We appreciate your patience and cooperation as we work through this evolving situation. We take very seriously the responsibility to make prudent and well-informed choices for the well-being of our campus communities and the public. We continue to prepare for all scenarios in this rapidly evolving situation.</span><br/><br/><span>The health of our students, faculty and staff is our highest priority.

<p>Our health professionals will continue monitoring the situation and are following the direction given by public health experts. It is important to note that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has issued a recommendation to avoid all nonessential travel to Hubei Province, China. Students who have traveled from China in the past 14 days and have a fever, cough, or difficulty breathing should contact Student Health Services immediately at 706-864-1948 (Dahlonega) or 678-696-2676 (Gainesville).&#160;&#160;</p>
<p>Symptoms of coronavirus are similar to the seasonal flu, which remains the higher risk for our population. This is also the time of year when we typically see a rise in cases of seasonal flu.&#160; We encourage everyone on campus to follow the same preventative strategies used during a normal cold and flu season: getting a flu shot, washing hands regularly, covering coughs and sneezes, and staying home when experiencing symptoms of illness. Students who have paid their health fee are eligible for a flu shot at no charge, while supplies last.&#160;</p>
<p>It is recommended that anyone over the age of 6 months get the flu shot, and especially people with chronic medical conditions who are at high-risk for flu-related complications.</p></div>

<p>Your hard work has continued to keep all of our 26 institutions and the University System Office (USO) accessible and responsive in an extraordinary time, even as you have had to juggle your own personal challenges.I am grateful and proud of the way each of you has responded to our rapid shift in operations.</p>
<p>The challenges thrown at us by the COVID-19 pandemic are unprecedented. The health and safety of our students and employees are our greatest priorities.</p>
<p>As you are aware, the state of Georgia is facing a significant drop in revenue from the coronavirus that has caused the news I must now share.</p>
<p>Today, the state Office of Planning and Budget, House Budget and Research Office, and Senate Budget and Evaluation Office directed all state agencies to develop new spending proposals for fiscal year 2021, which begins July 1. In doing so, all agencies including USG must submit proposals that include a 14% reduction of their base budget.</p>
<p>I have instructed all institutions and the University System Office to prepare a plan to address these 14% reductions. These plans must be submitted to the state no later than May 20.</p>
<p>This will not be easy work. We have asked everyone to be strategic in their approach to meeting this reduction, therefore across the board cuts are not permitted. Our priority continues to be helping our students complete a college education. Our mission is more critical than ever as we take a leading role in helping all Georgians recover.</p>
<p>Right now, institutions are only submitting plans to address the 14% reductions for FY21. It will be some time before we will know the specifics of these plans and how they will be implemented. Among actions that may be taken include furloughs and layoffs. Additionally, we are placing a hold on all vacant positions not deemed essential, and remain committed to a critical hire process for the few that are. We will be faced with some uncertainty until the FY21 budget is adopted and approved.</p>
<p>The state will continue to monitor the financial impact of COVID-19 and adjust as circumstances require. Any budget plans submitted to the state must also be finalized and approved by the Georgia Legislature, and signed by the Governor.</p>
<p>I know this is hard news to hear. Please keep in close contact with your supervisor for further guidance and if you have any questions. We will provide updates as quickly and as transparently as possible.</p>
<p>Above all, know you are making a difference at a critical time for the University System. There is no question this will be tough. But we will get through it, and be stronger. Thank you for all you do to support our students and the state of Georgia.</p>
<p>Sincerely,<br/>Steve W. Wrigley<br/>Chancellor</p></div>
