                     <ul>
                        <li><span>We are actively working through federal financial aid guidance to either refund a
                              prorated amount of room and board or provide a credit to returning students for the
                              fall. We will share that information with you once it is finalized, but we anticipate
                              it will take some time to receive appropriate guidance before we can proceed. When
                              costs change there are impacts on financial aid,&nbsp;and we want to be careful to consider
                              all financial aid implications for our students.&nbsp;</span></li>
                        <li>At this time, student employment has ceased on campus. There are a very small number
                           of students, primarily tutors, (by exception) who will be allowed to work remotely
                           to help our students successfully complete their classwork virtually. If you are one
                           of these students, then your supervisor will be/has been in contact with you. Students
                           who have a payroll check waiting for them can request the check be mailed to their
                           home address by calling the Business Office at 309-457-2124.
                        </li>
                        <li>We understand a lot of families are experiencing financial hardship right now. If
                           you need to delay March or April monthly payments to avoid overdrawing an account,
                           please contact the Business Office directly at 309-457-2124. If your income has been
                           impacted and you would like to discuss updates to your FAFSA, please contact the Office
                           of Student Financial Planning at 309-457-2129.

                           <p><b><span>IF I CHOOSE THE CR OPTION, DOES THAT MEAN I DON'T HAVE TO FINISH THE COURSE?</span></b><span>&nbsp; No, it does not; you have to finish every course to earn credit.&nbsp; Even when choosing
                                 the CR option, you’re expected to fulfill the requirements of the whole course to
                                 the best of your ability.&nbsp; The CR option simply allows you to choose how you will
                                 earn credit for that course, with a grade or with CR/NC.&nbsp; (Federal regulations basically
                                 stipulate that students must complete a full semester of coursework in order to remain
                                 eligible for aid.)</span></p>
                           <p><b><span>ISN’T TEN DAYS A SHORT TIME TO DECIDE ON CR/NC?<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></b><span>We believe that all students will have a good sense within ten days, by April 1, whether
                                 they’re going to need some grade flexibility or whether they’re going to be able to
                                 complete new course requirements as planned.&nbsp;<i><span>&nbsp;</span></i><i>Students should begin</i><span>&nbsp;</span><i>talking to their advisors very soon.<span>&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;</span></span>Although Student Life is helpful in so many ways, it’s your faculty members who can
                                    give you the best advice, and who can help you devise the best answers for yourself.<span>&nbsp;</span></i></span></p>
                           <p><b><span>WHAT IF I DON’T HAVE RELIABLE ACCESS TO THE INTERNET?<span>&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;</span></span>ALL</span></b><span><span>&nbsp;</span>faculty are going to work with you and the limitations that you’re facing.<span>&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;</span></span>I know that some are indicating that you<span>&nbsp;</span><i>must<span>&nbsp;</span></i>do this or that, but the truth is that we’re all facing a new way of learning and
                                 we<span>&nbsp;</span><b>ALL</b><span>&nbsp;</span>need to be flexible in our expectations.<span>&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;</span></span>This means I will continue to work with faculty as we move forward so that we acknowledge
                                 what you can’t do and work with what you can.<span>&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;</span></span>We know that you’re all capable of great things, even in hard times, and want to help
                                 you achieve the best you can.<span>&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;</span></span>Faculty<span>&nbsp;</span><i>do<span>&nbsp;</span></i>want to try to give you the education you deserve, but we will all work with what
                                 you’re capable of giving.<span>&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;</span></span>Just communicate frequently with your professors to keep them in the loop of those
                                 possibilities.<span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
                           <p><span><b>HOW MIGHT THIS AFFECT MY GPA, MY DESIRE TO TRANSFER, OR OTHER TRANSCRIPT-RELATED SITUATIONS?<span>&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;</span></span></b>Frankly, we can’t say right now, because this is new territory for the College itself.<span>&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;</span></span>However, I can tell you that MANY other colleges and universities across the country
                                 are moving to this pass/fail options and so MANY other colleges and universities are
                                 going to be flexible in accepting such credits.<span>&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;</span></span>We’re all just sort of putting an asterisk by this semester and going “well, we all
                                 did the best we could for our particular students.”<span>&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;</span></span>In terms of GPA raising or lowering, work with your advisors to think it through.<span>&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;</span></span>Again, those people most familiar with your academic program and performance are your
                                 best resources when it comes to your academic present and future.</span></p>
                           <p><b><span>WHAT IF I RECEIVED A MIDTERM WARNING GRADE?<span>&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;</span></span>SHOULD I JUST DROP THE CLASS?<span>&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></b><span>The best answer to that is to review your own capabilities at this time (can you participate
                                 in the class as the professor asks, are you capable of doing better with the work,
                                 etc.) and -- in my constant answer! – talk to your professor.<span>&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;</span></span>They will have a viewpoint that you need to hear.<span>&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;</span></span>Then you can make a smart, informed decision.<span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
                           <p><b><span>WHAT IF I DECIDE I NEED TO DROP A CLASS?</span></b><span><span>&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;</span></span>We have removed the add/drop fee for the rest of the semester and will be as flexible
                                 as we can be with the drop date.<span>&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;</span></span>We still have to be able to process things administratively, but we will do what we
                                 can – just as you are.<span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
                           <p><span>Thank you to you all for your good questions and your concerns.<span>&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;</span></span>We have just as many as you do -- promise -- and we’re working through them one at
                                 a time, just like you.<span>&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;</span></span>I hope this FAQ helps with some of your pressing ones, but we look forward to hearing

                           Policy</a><div class="collapse-light-content">
                           <p>Dear Students –</p>
                           <p>All of us here at the College know just how profoundly your lives are changing, and
                              not just because we’re moving your educations online. We know that anxiety is high.
                              We can only do so much to help that, but we want to be able to affect those things
                              we can, to help you get through the coming weeks.
                           </p>
                           <p>Thus, for this semester only, the College is instituting a Credit/No Credit option
                              for every student in every course. For this semester only, you have until Wednesday,
                              April 1, to make the choice to take any of your courses, as many as you need, for
                              CR/NC. If you do not make a choice, you will remain on the usual graded scale. You
                              must talk to your advisor before making this choice and then inform both advisor and
                              professor when you’ve made your decision.
                           </p>
                           <p>Again, your deadline to make this choice is April 1, 2020. If you choose to take this
                              one-time option, when you earn a C- or above in your course, you will be assigned
                              a grade of Credit. If your work is D+ or below, you will earn a No Credit.
                           </p>
                           <p>Now, there are some things to consider before immediately jumping on the CR/NC bandwagon,
                              which is why it’s key to talk to your advisor. For instance:
                           </p>
                           <p>• For those of you on probation and who need to improve your GPA, talk to your advisors,
                              because it might be better for you to stay with normal grades;<br>• For those of you considering graduate schools, talk to your advisors, because it
                              might be better for you to stay with normal grades, since graduate schools tend to
                              discount CR/NC courses; <br>• For those of you who received midterm warning grades and feel like you might earn
                              less than a C- in a course (but more than an F), talk to your advisers, because staying
                              with the graded options, even if you earn a D or D-, will still get you credit for
                              the course.
                           </p>
                           <p>The lesson is talk to your advisor before making any decisions.</p>
                           <p>We hope that your transition to remote learning is as smooth and successful as can
                              be. We’re all working hard for that success and hope you keep us in the loop for ways
                              we can help.
                           </p>

                           <p>Friends—First, let me say thanks for all that each of you is doing.&nbsp; Some of us are
                              quickly adapting courses and providing the support to teach our students remotely.&nbsp;
                              Others of us are keeping our facilities clean and safe.&nbsp; Still others of us are caring
                              for our students as they adjust to being away and missing a glorious spring on campus.&nbsp;
                              Others yet are continuing to work with prospective students and their families to
                              demonstrate even more clearly why Monmouth should be their college home.&nbsp; These are
                              among the dozens of other activities that go into the operation of the College in
                              these crazy, extraordinary, challenging times.&nbsp;
                           </p>
                           <p>All of this work is essential to the continued strength of Monmouth College, and as
                              much as ever-changing circumstances allow, that work must continue.&nbsp; We are enabling
                              as many people as possible to perform that work from home.&nbsp; A number of our offices
                              have already made some such accommodations.&nbsp; By reducing the on-campus “footprint,”
                              we can continue our vital work and do our part for the well-being of our College community
                              and the wider Monmouth community.&nbsp;
                           </p>
                           <p>Your supervisors will be talking with each of you individually, including who will
                              be designated to work from home and who will be asked to be on campus more frequently.&nbsp;
                              Unless otherwise agreed upon with your supervisor, this policy will go into effect
                              with the beginning of the work week on Sunday, March 22<sup>nd</sup> .&nbsp; You will receive additional communications, mostly from Mike McNall, with more
                              detail.&nbsp;&nbsp;
                           </p>
                           <p>Each one of us has an important role to play in steering the College through this
                              trial by fire, and having it and us stronger on the other side.&nbsp; Lobie and I are proud
                              to be part of such a great team.

                           <p class="x_MsoNormal"><span>Dear Seniors—Lobie and I, and all of us on campus, have had you in our minds and hearts
                                 these last few days.&nbsp; Among the many inconveniences and injustices that COVID-19 has
                                 caused, stealing your senior-year spring is among the saddest.&nbsp; We miss all of our
                                 students, but most especially miss celebrating this spring with you.</span></p>
                           <p class="x_MsoNormal"><span>We know that you understand that we have been trying to anticipate and prepare for
                                 the many disruptions that the COVID-19 crisis has brought to us, and we greatly appreciate
                                 that understanding.&nbsp; Among the many things on your minds, and on ours, is Commencement.&nbsp;
                                 On Tuesday the Centers for Disease Control issued a directive against any gatherings
                                 of 50 or more for eight weeks.&nbsp; That directive was later amended to gatherings of
                                 10 or more.&nbsp; We are committed to holding in person, on campus Commencement ceremony<span class="x_apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span><i>at some point this year</i>—but given the directives currently in place and the fluidity of the situation, that
                                 ceremony will<span class="x_apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span><b>not</b><span class="x_apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>take place on May 17.&nbsp; We struggled mightily to find some way that Commencement could
                                 proceed as scheduled, but events and concern for everyone’s wellbeing makes that impossible.&nbsp;</span></p>
                           <p class="x_MsoNormal"><span>We have already begun to discuss possible alternatives, and ASMC leadership is soliciting
                                 ideas from your class.&nbsp; We are also discussing creating a virtual commemoration to
                                 occur at noon on May 17, and we will certainly keep you informed at every step.&nbsp;<span class="x_apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></span></p>
                           <p class="x_MsoNormal"><span>We all know how tremendously disappointing this is for all of you and for your families.&nbsp;
                                 Commencement Day is the highlight of the year for Lobie and me, as it is for all of
                                 the faculty and staff.&nbsp; It is the prize that you seek, and it is our joy to be a part
                                 of your quest.&nbsp; Nothing—nothing—can diminish your achievement, or our pride in you.&nbsp;

                           <p class="x_MsoNormal"><span>First, I am deeply grateful to our students and their families, faculty, staff, trustees,
                                 alumni, and friends for their patience, flexibility, and good spirit in this situation.</span></p>
                           <p class="x_MsoNormal"><span>This continues to be an extraordinary time for all of us. As responses to the spread
                                 of COVID-19 accelerate, our Senior Staff has been meeting around the clock to continue
                                 to discuss and assess our plans. We remain guided by our twin commitments: the quality
                                 education of our students and the well-being of our campus community.&nbsp; As the situation
                                 evolves, so do our plans.</span></p>
                           <p class="x_MsoNormal"><span>On Wednesday, we felt that the Flexible Plan described earlier was the appropriate
                                 response.&nbsp; However, the progression of the disease is accelerating—there are now several
                                 cases in Illinois outside of the Chicago area, including at least one case in Peoria.&nbsp;
                                 Also, federal and state policies are shifting rapidly, and will dictate actions on
                                 our part.</span></p>
                           <p class="x_MsoNormal"><b><span>After consultation with Faculty Senate and Board leadership, Monmouth College will
                                    move exclusively to remote learning, effective Monday, March 23.</span></b><span><span>&nbsp;</span>Classes will remain canceled this week, March 16-20.&nbsp; All campus events, meetings,
                                 and athletic practices are canceled effective immediately and until further notice.</span></p>

                                 continue to serve the students who are on our campus now.&nbsp; All students, excepting
                                 those in extremely extenuating circumstances with whom we will work directly, should
                                 make plans to collect their belongings between now and Sunday, April 5, at 5:00 p.m.
                                 There will be an additional email to students providing much more guidance, direction
                                 and details regarding move-out.&nbsp; We are actively working through the financial aid
                                 guidance to either refund a prorated amount of room and board or provide a credit
                                 to returning students for the fall.&nbsp; We will share that information with you once
                                 it is finalized.</span></p>
                           <p class="x_MsoNormal"><span>While there are still no known cases of COVID-19 on campus, the situation is changing
                                 rapidly. Federal and state policies responding to the virus are also changing rapidly,
                                 and we are worried about the possibility of domestic travel restrictions, which may
                                 make it difficult for students on campus to get home. We believe remote learning to
                                 be the most effective decision at this point to protect the health and wellness of
                                 all community members while continuing to deliver a quality education.</span></p>
                           <p class="x_MsoNormal"><span>This situation has created stress and anxiety for everyone, and we understand that
                                 this change will create a significant inconvenience for many, especially for those
                                 students already on their way back to campus.&nbsp; We do not make this decision lightly,
                                 and we are committed to working with students and families individually. We also understand
                                 that some students have limited access to technology and internet at home; we will
                                 work with those students to help them finish the semester successfully.</span></p>
                           <p class="x_MsoNormal"><span>A reminder that workshops for faculty and staff will begin tomorrow, March 16, to
                                 assist with the transition to remote academic instruction and remote work.&nbsp; We will
                                 video record the workshops for those interested in participating virtually.</span></p>
                           <p class="x_MsoNormal"><span>The College’s Senior Staff will continue to meet daily to assess the situation and
                                 how it affects remaining College events, such as Commencement exercises.&nbsp; We will
                                 provide more detail regarding specific issues in subsequent communications, and we
                                 will continue to provide regular updates to all of you.</span></p>
                           <p class="x_MsoNormal"><span>Even as the Civil War swept across the country, Founding President David Wallace was
                                 determined to keep the College open, declaring in the fall of 1862: “We must educate,
                                 whether there be peace or war.” &nbsp;That moment defined the early history of the College,
                                 and set a standard for all who have followed.&nbsp; This is the crisis that has come to
                                 our time.&nbsp; Like our predecessors, I know that we will rally, support one another,
                                 act with seriousness but retain our good hearts and good humor.&nbsp; Let us be the example
                                 that we set for our students, for other institutions, and for the state and nation.&nbsp;
                                 Let those who look back on us in the years to come say, “They did their best, and
                                 they did well.”</span></p>

                           <p class="x_MsoNormal">As recently as Thursday afternoon, statements by federal government officials indicated
                              that self-quarantine for US nationals returning from Europe would be voluntary. However,
                              even as our students were reaching the airport in Frankfurt, we learned that the Department
                              of Homeland Security is now mandating a fourteen-day self-quarantine.&nbsp; We, like you,
                              are frustrated by the conflicting guidance and directives that continue to be issued.&nbsp;
                           </p>
                           <p class="x_MsoNormal">We have no choice but to follow this Homeland Security requirement.&nbsp; We do this in
                              our continuing efforts to serve the twin commitments to ensure our students’ quality
                              education and safeguard the well-being of our campus community.&nbsp; We know that this
                              federal requirement will represent a significant inconvenience for many of you and
                              frustration for all of you.&nbsp;
                           </p>
                           <p class="x_MsoNormal">In an effort to meet Homeland Security’s requirement, the very best way to ensure
                              the health of your student and to make them as comfortable as possible is for them
                              to fulfill this two-week period in the care of your home and under the guidance of
                              your primary care provider.&nbsp; You should make arrangements to have your student met
                              at the bus or, if more convenient, at O’Hare Airport.&nbsp; We realize that this is a great
                              inconvenience but, again, it is necessitated by the new federal rules.&nbsp; If you absolutely
                              cannot meet your student today, please contact us.&nbsp;
                           </p>
                           <p class="x_MsoNormal"><span>We understand that you are likely frustrated right now by the fact that plans have
                                 changed yet again. We would not be making this decision if we weren’t compelled to
                                 by forces beyond our control. We know you have questions about what this self-quarantine
                                 means for you and others in your household.&nbsp; The best answer for your particular circumstances
                                 will come from your family care providers and your employers, or your local county
                                 health department.</span></p>
                           <p class="x_MsoNormal"><span>We will follow up with each of you via telephone.&nbsp; The important thing is that our
                                 students will be home today, and we are very grateful for that fundamental fact.&nbsp;
                                 We will continue to work together for the best interest of all of our students.&nbsp;</span></p>

                           <p class="x_MsoNormal">Today, March 13, 2020, a campus-wide announcement was made regarding a Flexible Plan
                              that will be in place for the rest of this semester.&nbsp; This is a follow-up communication
                              to specify how the Flexible Plan will apply to staff.

                           <p class="x_MsoNormal">To support individual health and wellness choices, staff who have capability to work
                              on flex time or from home may choose to do so, with the approval of their supervisor
                              and the understanding that there are some minimum staffing requirements at the College.&nbsp;

                           <p class="x_MsoNormal">Some staff duties do not lend themselves to working remotely.&nbsp; In these cases, individuals
                              who are in a high-risk category regarding COVID-19 infection (age 60+ or have chronic
                              medical condition) will have the opportunity to use benefit time or time without pay
                              to remove themselves from campus.&nbsp;&nbsp;

                           <p class="x_MsoNormal">This practice will be in place until the end of the semester, after which time it
                              will be reevaluated.&nbsp;

                        <p><em>Letter sent March 13 to Monmouth College students, faculty, staff and parents from
                              President Clarence Wyatt:</em>&nbsp;
                        </p>
                        <p>Dear Monmouth College Community –</p>
                        <p>We are living in an extraordinary time. No college or university has as a one-size-fits-all
                           universal playbook which will help us get through it.&nbsp; Yet we remain true to our twin
                           commitments:&nbsp; the quality education of our students and the well-being of our campus
                           community.
                        </p>
                        <p>Monmouth College’s greatest gifts have always been its dedication and its creativity.&nbsp;
                           At this time, its greatest strength also needs to be its flexibility.
                        </p>
                        <p>As circumstances change, we continue to receive information, evaluate other models,
                           and assess what is right for our students and our community.&nbsp; Thus, our plans continue
                           to evolve.&nbsp; And those plans now show us that flexibility is our greatest need and
                           our greatest opportunity, even at this tough moment. Although our plan was to begin
                           classes on Wednesday, we have reassessed.&nbsp; What now serves our community best is the
                           ability for faculty, staff, and students to make choices about how they work, whether
                           that work is teaching, or learning, or carrying out the other roles the College needs.&nbsp;
                        </p>
                        <p><strong>Thus, on Monday, March 23, classes will begin again under a <em>Flexible Plan</em>.&nbsp; Classes will be cancelled Monday, March 16, through Friday, March 20.&nbsp; The <em>Flexible Plan</em> will be in place for the rest of the semester, as we remain open as a place of study
                              and work.</strong></p>
                        <p>This Plan allows for individual choice about how to work:</p>
                        <ul>
                           <li>After consulting with their families, students can make the choice to return to campus
                              or stay at home to study online. Our residence halls and food services will be open
                              beginning this weekend, as planned.&nbsp; If you’re studying online, professors will contact
                              you about how that will work for their particular courses.&nbsp; If you choose to stay
                              at home and continue your studies, please notify Student Life that you are not returning
                              to campus.
                           </li>
                           <li>Teachers can choose to move their classes fully online. Those who prefer to continue
                              classroom instruction can choose that, while addressing the needs of students who
                              will be studying online.&nbsp;
                           </li>
                           <li>Staff will also have options regarding flexibility in their work. A separate note
                              from the Personnel Office will provide additional details.
                           </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>From now until March 23, we will be running workshops of various sorts to help faculty
                           move materials and classes online, including those workshops already scheduled for
                           Monday and Tuesday of next week.&nbsp; Students are welcome back to campus this weekend,
                           as planned, but classes will not begin until the next Monday, the 23<sup>rd</sup>.&nbsp; For further updates, please continue to check your email regularly and to look
                           on the Monmouth College Covid-19 Update page (<a href="https://www.monmouthcollege.edu/covid">monmouthcollege.edu/covid</a>).&nbsp;
                        </p>
                        <p>There is no perfect answer to the crisis that has happened upon us.&nbsp; We believe this
                           response affirms our twin commitments to quality education and to campus community
                           wellbeing – even as we acknowledge that a pandemic has a way of throwing a wrench
                           into that mission.&nbsp; Given the information that we have, and that we continue to gather
                           and reassess, this is the plan which serves all the members of our community best
                           for the present, and the immediate future.

                        <p><em>Letter sent March 12 to Monmouth College chorale students and parents from Dean Mark
                              Willhardt:</em>&nbsp;
                        </p>
                        <p>Dear Chorale Parents –</p>
                        <p>COVID-19 is causing anxiety for everyone — our students who are abroad, the families
                           waiting for their return, and those of us entrusted to make decisions for the entire
                           College community.
                        </p>
                        <p>As information changes, so do our procedures and plans, and that’s exactly the way
                           that new information should affect our practice.&nbsp; Thank you for your continued patience.
                        </p>
                        <p>Because of new information and our evolving considerations, the College has decided<span>&nbsp;</span><i>not<span>&nbsp;</span></i>to require that students returning from Austria, Spain, Finland, and the Czech Republic
                           self-quarantine.&nbsp; Instead, we ask that asymptomatic students self-monitor for fever,
                           dry cough, and upper-respiratory distress for a period of two weeks following their
                           return.&nbsp; If they are on campus and become symptomatic, they must contact Student Life
                           immediately. (If after business hours, contact Campus Safety, who will in turn get
                           in touch with Student Life.)&nbsp;
                        </p>
                        <p>Students can still choose to self-isolate or self-quarantine, off-campus at home.&nbsp;
                           Should they choose to, we will fully facilitate their continued academic progress
                           during that period.
                        </p>
                        <p>Why this change?&nbsp; Inconsistent information from the federal government and other sources
                           made decision-making a challenge.&nbsp; This afternoon, we triangulated our information
                           for a fuller picture of the situation.
                        </p>
                        <p>Travel plans for our students remain the same – the flight will arrive at 2 p.m. Saturday
                           at O’Hare Airport.&nbsp; However, there has been a change of location where the bus will
                           arrive on campus.&nbsp; If you choose to pick up your student, the bus will arrive at campus
                           by around 7 p.m. at the circle drive north of the Huff Athletic Center.
                        </p>
                        <p>Thank you again for your patience and cooperation during such a trying time.</p>

                        <p><em>Letter sent March 11 to Monmouth College students from President Clarence Wyatt:</em>&nbsp;
                        </p>
                        <p>Monmouth College has been carefully following the developments of the novel coronavirus
                           and its expression, COVID-19. We understand you may have questions and concerns, and
                           we want to reassure you of our commitment to the health and safety of our campus community.&nbsp;
                        </p>
                        <p>As of this email, Illinois has 25 confirmed cases of COVID-19 and none of them are
                           in Warren or adjacent counties. But vigilance is key.&nbsp;
                        </p>
                        <p>Students will be welcomed back to campus as usual after Break, with residence halls
                           and dining services opening this weekend as originally scheduled. However, as part
                           of our ongoing efforts to address the many changes which the novel coronavirus has
                           necessitated, we have decided to delay the start of classes until Wednesday, March
                           18.&nbsp; All classes will be cancelled for Monday and Tuesday to give the campus time
                           to continue preparations for our response to COVID-19. In-person classes will resume
                           as scheduled on Wednesday. We are monitoring the situation hourly and will keep you
                           and your families updated if things change.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                        </p>
                        <p>If you have recently been in areas with a high incidence of infection and are showing
                           signs of fever, dry cough and/or shortness of breath, or you have been in close contact
                           with someone who is known to have recently traveled to these areas and is experiencing
                           these symptoms, we ask that you self-quarantine <em>off campus at home</em> for a period of two weeks and contact the Office of Student Life. If you have underlying
                           health concerns, we encourage you to discuss any recommendations with your health
                           care provider.&nbsp; If you have additional questions or are being advised to delay your
                           return, you are encouraged to reach out to the Office of Student Life directly, at
                           309-457-2114 or email <a href="mailto:residencelife@monmouthcollege.edu?subject=">Residence Life</a>.&nbsp;
