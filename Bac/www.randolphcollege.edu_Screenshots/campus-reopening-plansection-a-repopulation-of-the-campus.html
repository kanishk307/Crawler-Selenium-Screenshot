<h2>Randolph College Coronavirus Task Force</h2>
<p>After making the decision to officially close the campus following spring break, classes at Randolph College were conducted online, commencement exercises were postponed, and a large portion of the College’s employees worked remotely. The Randolph College Coronavirus Task Force was established in mid-March as a subcommittee of the College’s Critical Incident Management Team.</p>
<p><strong>The members of the task force are:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Bradley W. Bateman, President</li>
<li>Jennifer Bondurant, Director of the Counseling Center</li>
<li>Ruby Bryant, Director of Health Services</li>
<li>Travis Carter, Dean of Admission</li>
<li>Brenda Edson, Director of College Relations</li>
<li>Carl Girelli, Provost &amp; Vice President for Academic Affairs</li>
<li>Adam Houlihan, Associate Professor of Biology</li>
<li>Kris Irwin, Director of Campus Safety</li>
<li>Christopher Lemasters, Dean of Students</li>
<li>Sharon Saunders, Director of Human Resources</li>
<li>Mitch Wesolowski, Vice President for Finance and Administration</li>
<li>Steve Willis, Special Assistant to the President &amp; Secretary of the Board of Trustees</li>
</ul>
<p>The task force continues to meet daily and remains committed to ensuring that Randolph is proactive in regards to the impact of COVID-19 on our campus. The task force addresses all questions related to what living, learning, and working arrangements will look like when the Randolph community returns in the fall. The group focuses on public health guidance regarding social distancing and other preventative measures, while preparing for multiple scenarios should state or federal guidelines dictate changes in how we operate our campus.</p>
<p>The task force maintains close contact with the local health department:</p>

<h2>Phased Return to Work Plan</h2>
<p>Working closely with the task force, the Office of Human Resources established a Phased Return to Work Plan for employees in early June:</p>
<p><strong><em>Request for Accommodations:</em></strong> Employees who have health conditions that may require accommodations or are in the high risk category per CDC guidelines <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/need-extra-precautions/people-at-higher-risk.html">https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/need-extra-precautions/people-at-higher-risk.html</a> and are needing an accommodation to work from home, contact Human Resources at 434-947-8114 or email Sharon Saunders <a href="mailto:ssaunders@randolphcollege.edu">ssaunders@randolphcollege.edu</a> or Connie Everhart <a href="mailto:ceverhart@randolphcollege.edu">ceverhart@randolphcollege.edu</a>.</p>
<p><strong><em>Emotional Health:</em></strong> COVID-19 can create stress from the fear of illness, both for individuals and their families, as well as from uncertainty and changes in our normal routines. We want to remind everyone of the free employee assistance program offered to all employees. All Points EAP offers free confidential counseling to you and any member of your household. In person or telephonic appointments are available at 434-845-1246.</p>
<p><strong><em>Use a screening tool:</em></strong> There are several screening tools available. If you have an Apple iPhone, you can search “COVID 19 Screening Tool.” From any device, go to <a href="http://www.vdh.virginia.gov">www.vdh.virginia.gov</a> click on COVIDCHECK, and then click on CHECK YOUR SYMPTOMS.</p>

</ul>
<p><a name="students-return"></a></p>
<h2>Students Return to Campus</h2>
<p>The College plans to resume classes on campus for fall 2020. Adjustments have been made to the academic calendar that will allow classes to begin one week earlier than originally announced. Fall break has been eliminated from the schedule, and the students will not return to campus following Thanksgiving.</p>
<p>Move-in for residential students will be staggered so that students and families will be less likely to interact with a large number of individuals while on campus. During the move-in process, each individual in a student’s move-in party will be required to have their temperature taken by a member of the College’s health center staff. Should the student or any individual in the student’s party have a temperature of 100.4°F (or greater), the student would need to return home, or, in the event that the student has traveled a long distance, the student would need to be quarantined on campus. The College’s health center director will be available at all times during move-in days to handle these situations should any arise.</p>
<p>Students will not be approved to move into their rooms prior to their prescribed move-in date. Students sharing a room will not be able to move their belongings in at the same time and will not be able to arrive on their prescribed move-in date at the same time. Move-in and drop-off will be designed (to the best of the College’s ability) to only allow occupants in every other room. This will help to provide six feet of distancing between people during move-in activity. The College will require guests and staff assisting with move-in to wear coverings while they are in the residential facilities.</p>
<p>The <strong>proposed move-in dates</strong> are as follows (dates are subject to change):</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>International Students:</strong> Case by case basis depending on academic/programmatic start time and need for 14-day quarantine.</li>
<li><strong>First student arrival:</strong> July 29, 2020</li>
<li><strong>Head Residents arrival:</strong> August 5, 2020</li>
<li><strong>Resident Assistants and Davenport Leaders:</strong> August 9, 2020</li>
<li><strong>SUPER and STAR Programs:</strong> August 13, 2020</li>
<li><strong>New Student Move-In:</strong> August 20, 2020</li>
<li><strong>Returning Student Move-In:</strong> August 22–23, 2020</li>
</ul>
<p>Collaborative training sessions will take place virtually for student leaders and will be designed to educate members of the Randolph Programming Board (RPB), resident assistants (RAs), head residents, and Davenport leaders about COVID-19 health guidelines, as well as mandated reporting, and bystander intervention. (Should in-person trainings be needed, these will be held in Smith Hall Theatre, which holds 800+ and will allow student leaders and presenters to maintain social distancing.)</p>
<p>RAs will serve as support staff on move-in days. They will be provided face coverings and gloves and assigned to help with maintaining social distancing and safety regulations during the move-in processes.</p>
<p>RAs will conduct hall meetings virtually with their residents throughout fall 2020. As part of these hall meetings, RAs will review policies/procedures at these meetings, including COVID-19 guidelines for residential/community living.</p>
<p>RAs will conduct rounds in their respective buildings each week on Thursday, Friday, and Saturday. Resident Assistants will work in a rotation for week-to-week coverage to ensure that no RA is responsible for rounds every week. RAs will walk through each floor/community of their building once between the hours of 10 p.m. and midnight. RAs may have the responsibility for disinfecting public spaces while conducting rounds. They will wear face coverings and gloves during this time.</p>
<p><strong>Fall 2020 Orientation for new students</strong> will take place virtually. Online modules will be available to students using the Moodle platform. A COVID-19 prevention education module will be added to the College’s orientation materials. Students will receive access to Moodle beginning in August. All evening orientation social activities after students move-in will be held virtually.</p>
<p>The Student Government (SG) oversees all other club organizations. They provide a training each semester for all active clubs. The fall training for SG will include guidelines for holding events safely during fall 2020. Clubs will be required to complete a form and have their events approved by a member of the Office of Student Affairs (DOS) staff to ensure that required safety measures are in place. Each event must have a staff (non-student) sponsor dedicated to remaining on site for the duration of the event to ensure that guidelines are followed. Flyers will no longer be the main method of event advertising. SG will encourage clubs and organizations to use the College’s online portal to advertise their events.</p>
<p>Furniture in campus lounges and common areas will be spaced six feet apart with signage stating that furniture may not be moved. Open residence hall common areas will have posted occupancy limits and furniture will be spaced six feet apart with signage stating that furniture may not be moved.<br />
<a name="social-distancing"></a></p>
<h2>Social Distancing</h2>
<p>Social distancing is a priority at Randolph College. Classroom and office spaces are being rearranged, some spaces are being closed off, and clear circulation patterns for high traffic areas are being defined and identified.</p>
<ul>
<li>Offices and departments will rearrange work areas to account for six feet of space between</li>
<li>Distance markers (blue painters tape) are being placed on the floor across campus to help support the six feet distancing.</li>
<li>Plexiglas shields are being added as a protective barrier in areas across campus that have daily regular contact with individuals.</li>
<li>Plexi shields are being added to classrooms and labs.</li>
<li>Large meeting rooms have been evaluated taking the 6 feet distancing into consideration; some will be repurposed and used for classrooms.</li>
<li>Supervisors will stagger work shifts as needed.</li>
<li>The College has relocated some employees, cross-trained employees, and will continue to cross-train as needed.</li>
<li>The College began bringing employees back to campus in stages beginning June 15, 2020, in groups up to 30%. We are making accommodations for individuals in the high-risk category per CDC guidelines, and individuals with children whose school or child care facility may be closed due to COVID-19. These individuals will be allowed to work remotely.</li>
<li>Circulation control patterns will be implemented in buildings with high foot traffic (e.g. dining hall, stairways).</li>
<li>Elevator occupancy will be changed to single use. Signage will be posted on all</li>
<li>In-person meetings in offices will be limited to 2–3 people to ensure safe distance. Employees will be encouraged to continue using technology platforms (phone, conference calls, Google Meet, Zoom, etc.) for meetings.</li>
<li>Events and gatherings such as theatre performances, athletic games, and the like will be streamed without an audience.</li>
<li>Meetings with external participants should continue to be held via electronic</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Community kitchens in the residence halls</strong> will have posted occupancy limits determined by space. The majority of kitchens will allow for one person to cook at a time. A sign-up schedule will be posted outside of the space for students to reserve a specific time. If a residence hall has multiple kitchens, only one kitchen will be open, and an increased cleaning schedule will be facilitated through the Department of Building and Grounds. There will be no shared cooking supplies in the residential kitchens. Students will be required to clean and remove all of their cooking materials immediately when finished.</p>
<h3>Shared Objects</h3>
<ul>
<li>Sharing of items that are difficult to clean or disinfect is discouraged.</li>
<li>High-touch items will be removed from counters or desks (e.g. pens, pencils, and scissors).</li>
<li>Ensure adequate supplies to minimize sharing of high-touch materials to the extent possible, or limit use of supplies and equipment by one group of students at a time, and clean and disinfect between use.</li>
</ul>
<p><a name="cleaning-and-disinfecting-protocols"></a></p>
<h3>Cleaning and Disinfecting Protocols</h3>
<p>The following on-campus protocols have been established:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Residence halls (44 restrooms)</strong> &#8211; Twice per day, seven days per week—once by hand and once with fogger machine.</li>
<li><strong>Residence hall laundry rooms</strong> &#8211; Once per day, seven days per week, by hand or with fogger machine.</li>
<li><strong>Other restrooms across campus in classroom buildings and office buildings</strong> &#8211; Once per day.</li>
<li><strong>High traffic restrooms</strong> (e.g. Main Hall, Psychology Building, Caldwell Commons, etc.) &#8211; Twice per day, seven days per week, once by hand and once with fogger machine.</li>
<li><strong>Athletic locker rooms</strong> &#8211; Twice per day when in use by hand or with fogger machine.</li>
<li><strong>High traffic common areas</strong> (e.g. Main Hall, Student Center, hallways, etc.) &#8211; Wipe down 2–3 times per day, seven days per week.</li>
<li><strong>Classrooms and labs</strong> &#8211; Once per day. Disinfectant spray and paper towels provided in each classroom along with hand sanitizer. Plexiglas shields installed on podiums in classrooms for professors to stand behind. In addition, a moveable freestanding Plexiglas stand may be moved into classrooms that do not have podiums. These options add an additional layer of protection, especially in any areas where physical distancing may prove challenging.</li>
<li><strong>Offices</strong> &#8211; Once per day. Bottle of disinfectant spray with paper towels available in high traffic offices, along with hand sanitizer. Plexiglas shields in various offices and areas where physical distancing may prove challenging (e.g., Main Hall reception and information desk, library counter, registrar office, business office cashier and student accounts, dining hall cashier, etc.)</li>
<li><strong>Campus Safety vehicle and golf cart</strong> &#8211; Beginning and end of each shift.</li>
<li><strong>Other college vehicles</strong> &#8211; Each driver is responsible for cleaning their own vehicle daily and hand sanitizer is available in each vehicle.</li>
</ul>
<p><a name="student-health-services"></a></p>
<h2>Student Health Services</h2>
<p>The Randolph College Health Center maintains the following medical grade PPE in stock and in adequate supply for all health center staff: KN95 coverings, fitted N95 coverings, disposable gowns, 3-ply surgical coverings, gloves, and face shields. Staffing and additional supplies are in place for all typical health services.</p>
<p>The main entrance to the health and counseling centers will remain locked to avoid inadvertent walk-ins by students. All fire and emergency exit laws will continue to be observed. A doorbell with camera will be installed outside the front door allowing the receptionist to confirm identity and appointment time before allowing entry into the health center or counseling center. The screened door to the health and counseling centers has been removed to decrease high-touch areas.</p>
<p>All furniture used for seating in the waiting area will be moved to storage, and all educational materials/handouts previously available in the waiting area will be removed. These will be provided for students via virtual formats after each appointment. Students will use a touchless method to sign in for appointments; pens used to sign in at reception will be removed.</p>
<p>Signage will be posted inside and outside the health and counseling centers, notifying students that an appointment is required and walk-ins will not  be accommodated. Other signage provided by the CDC with information related to COVID-19 has been laminated and posted throughout the health center. Updates regarding appointments and health center hours will be posted to the health center website.</p>
<p>Custodial staff will thoroughly clean and disinfect the health center daily and provide increased cleaning and disinfection of restrooms and other high-traffic areas, such as reception, throughout the day. Exam rooms, the laboratory, and any other areas used to assess and treat students will be cleaned and disinfected by health center staff per CDC recommendations after each student visit. All interior doors will remain open except when required to be closed to protect patient confidentiality. If interior doors require closing, the health center staff inside the room will close the door.</p>
<p>All health center staff will be provided with appropriate PPE. Plexiglas has been installed at the reception window. Training regarding COVID-19 will be mandatory for all staff, including health center staff. Staff will arrive and depart at staggered intervals daily to avoid congestion at the entrance/exit of the health center building.</p>
<p>Students requesting wellness exams or non-respiratory related healthcare visits will be seen by appointment only, one student at a time, eliminating the need for a waiting area. Students who request healthcare visits related to a respiratory illness or who have symptoms of COVID-19 will be assessed and managed via telehealth appointments. There are no charges to students except for diagnostic lab testing (a list of tests which incur charges are listed on the health center website). COVID-19 testing of symptomatic students will be administered on campus by HealthWorks. Charges for COVID-19 diagnostic testing will be billed to the student’s insurance by the laboratory receiving the specimen, in accordance with state and federal insurance regulations.</p>
<p><strong>The counseling center</strong> has put in place the following COVID-19 procedures:</p>
<ul>
<li>The main waiting room including bathroom, counseling center waiting room, clinician offices, staff kitchen, and staff bathroom will be disinfected daily.</li>
<li>The only time clinician space will be shared is when the intern is on-site. The intern does not have an assigned space. The intern will be responsible for using disinfectant wipes to disinfect any shared items at the beginning and at the end of each day on-site.</li>
<li>Clinicians will use antibacterial wipes and/or Lysol spray for fabric sofas/chairs if a student has a challenging session and has produced bodily fluids (such as crying, runny nose, etc.).</li>
</ul>
<p>The counseling center will provide in-person and telehealth counseling services. The service delivery will be established between assigned clinician and student. Crisis assessments will be provided in person if the director deems it safe to do so. If a student is not feeling well, telehealth counseling can be provided as a substitute, whether or not this was the original agreed upon service delivery format. Both consents (Informed and Telehealth) will be signed at the beginning of treatment.</p>
<ul>
<li>Items such as sand tray and calm jar will be removed from the waiting room to discourage shared handling.</li>
<li>The swinging door to the counseling center wing will remain open during business hours.</li>
<li>The clinician will be the staff member opening and shutting office door.</li>
<li>The waiting area in the counseling center will have no more than two chairs to ensure six feet of distance is maintained. Overflow seating will be available in the main waiting area of the health center.</li>
<li>Each clinician office will ensure that six feet of distance is maintained during sessions. Only one student at a time will be allowed in a clinician’s office unless six feet distance can be maintained at all times.</li>
<li>Face coverings will be worn when walking into the building, when seated in the waiting areas, and when walking in the halls. Face coverings may be removed once seated in the clinician’s office.</li>
<li>Students should use the bathroom in the main waiting area, if needed.</li>
<li>If a student uses the shared laptop to complete administrative paperwork online, the computer must be wiped down with antibacterial wipe after use. This should be done by the person who is working with the student to complete the paperwork.</li>
<li>If a student needs to sign a document in the Electronic Health Record (EHR), the document should be printed out, signed, and scanned back in to the student’s electronic record. This will reduce the potential spread by eliminating the student’s use of clinician computer. Preference is to have a student use his/her own pen. If the student does not have a pen, then one pen should be selected for use and wiped off after the student has completed signing the form. Clinician should have his/her own pen to sign document and should not share the pen. Scanned documents should be given to the administrative assistant for scanning purposes.</li>
</ul>
<p><a name="campus-events"></a></p>
<h2>Campus Events</h2>
<p><strong>Traditional fall gatherings</strong> such as the faculty/staff picnic, etc., have been canceled. Convocation and the October 2020 meeting of the College’s Board of Trustees will be held virtually.</p>
<p><strong>Theatre events, dance concerts, and music recitals</strong> will be video streamed without a live audience. All of these events will be required to rehearse and perform with physical distancing and other health and safety measures in place. (Events at the Maier Museum of Art at Randolph College will be viewed in the same regard as theatre, dance, and recitals.)</p>
<p><strong>Athletics events</strong> will not have in-person spectators; these events will be streamed online.</p>
<p><strong>In-office meetings</strong> will be limited to no more than 2–3 people, depending on the space. Other meetings should be held virtually or by phone.</p>
<p>Due to the effect of physical distancing requirements and safety issues with larger gatherings, <strong>we will not offer catering services</strong> in the fall.<br />
<a name="communications-strategy"></a></p>
<h2>Communications Strategy</h2>
<p>Information about the College’s COVID-19 efforts is available on the <strong>College website</strong>. Students, faculty, and staff will receive notifications of information related to COVID-19 via the <strong>campus emergency notification system</strong>, <strong>emails from the president</strong>, and per the College’s online <strong>portal announcement system</strong>.<br />
<a name="mandatory-training"></a></p>
