                     <h2>Dear Hope Students, Families, Staff and Faculty,</h2>
                     
                     <p>It has been 99 days since we last held an in-person class at Hope College, and we
                        could not be more eager to have you back on campus!
                     </p>
                     
                     <p>For the past two months, we have been working around the clock to develop a framework
                        for re-opening campus to provide a safe, in-person living and learning experience.
                        Today we are excited to share what we believe is an innovative approach to the 2020–2021
                        academic year, which maximizes the student experience and campus health. Our framework
                        was developed after many hours of information-gathering and analysis, discussion amongst
                        the COVID-19 Steering Committee, consultation with other colleges, and input from
                        local health officials.
                     </p>
                     
                     <p>The most significant change relates to the academic calendar. We will start classes
                        earlier than originally planned in order to complete the fall semester prior to Thanksgiving.
                        The first day of classes will take place on Monday, August 17, and the semester will
                        end on Tuesday, November 24. Fall break also will be changed. Rather than two consecutive
                        days in October, the break will be staggered as two individual, mid-week days off.
                        These changes aim to limit movement to and from campus, helping mitigate the risk
                        of a resurgence of COVID-19.
                     </p>
                     
                     <p>Additional details on our fall framework are below. You undoubtedly will have many
                        questions, and we do not have all the answers yet. We will, of course, share more
                        over the coming weeks, and in the meantime, I ask for your continued patience and
                        grace.
                     </p>
                     
                     <p>Staying healthy this fall will involve some sacrifices from all of us. But these adjustments
                        are made in order to provide our students with the maximized opportunity for in-person
                        learning.
                     </p>
                     
                     <p>I am proud of how we came together this past spring. And as we look to the future,
                        I am confident that we will once again show each other — and the world — what makes
                        Hope College so special. Because in this time of uncertainty, the one thing that is
                        certain is HOPE.
                     </p>
                     
                     <p>Spera in Deo!</p>

                           <p>With this adjusted calendar, we will be updating our plans for pre-semester activities.
                              We will keep you posted on details regarding First-Year Orientation and pre-orientation
                              programs such as Summer Bridge, Step2Success and Day1, and courses that have pre-academic-year
                              components.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p>At this point, it is too early to make changes to the Spring 2021 semester calendar.
                              Per the current schedule, classes will begin on January 11 and end on April 30, with
                              exams May 3–7. If public health concerns prompt us to begin reconsidering dates for
                              the spring semester, we will let you know as soon as possible.
                           </p>

                           <p>One of our guiding principles has been that we will leave no student behind. In order
                              to make sure that all our students — including those who will not be able to be on
                              campus in the fall — stay on schedule for their planned graduation date, Hope’s course
                              schedule for the fall semester will include in-person classes and online classes.
                              Some courses, in order to accommodate distancing requirements, may be hybrid, which
                              will feature a blend of in-person and online components done from campus. The majority
                              of classes will be in-person. We are working to finalize the format for each class,
                              and that information should be available to students by mid-July. This combination
                              of course formats will allow students to continue making progress toward graduation
                              and continue living and learning on campus.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p>Two major considerations in our academic planning are:</p>
                           
                           <ul>
                              
                              <li><strong>Adapting instructional spaces</strong>: Given the need for physical distancing in shared spaces, we will be reducing occupancy
                                 in classrooms, labs and creative spaces. This puts pressure on instructional space
                                 in ways we’ve never experienced. Currently, we are in the process of reassigning layouts
                                 and locations for classes, using both traditional classrooms and other flexible spaces
                                 to meet safe distancing guidelines. We also are reconfiguring and outfitting some
                                 instructional spaces with additional equipment, such as plexiglass, and technology,
                                 such as cameras and microphones. The combination of in-person, online and hybrid formats
                                 will allow us to maximize our instructional space, which in turn will allow us to
                                 offer all the courses that were originally scheduled for the fall.
                              </li>
                              
                              <li><strong>Keeping students on track</strong>: We anticipate that some students and professors will be unable to return to campus,
                                 due to underlying health conditions, travel restrictions in their country, or other
                                 personal circumstances. It is also possible that some students or professors may need
                                 to be quarantined or isolated if they test positive for COVID-19 or they have been
                                 exposed to the virus. The different class formats will allow professors who cannot
                                 be on campus to continue teaching and students who cannot be on campus to continue
                                 taking classes. In some cases, due to program requirements, students who are attending
                                 remotely may still need to take classes that are being offered in-person; we are identifying
                                 technology options to accommodate those students, wherever possible.
                              </li>
                              
                           </ul>
                           
                           <p>As we know from the spring semester, a second wave of COVID-19 could prompt a shift
                              to remote learning. We would pursue this shift only if federal or state restrictions
                              or local health conditions required us to do so. Right now, our faculty are strengthening
                              their skills in online teaching. As opposed to the spring semester, when we had a
                              matter of days to shift and prepare, our faculty now have an entire summer to build
                              excellent online class experiences for their students, should they need to make the
                              shift at any point.

                           <p>Students, staff and faculty all play an important role in building and sustaining
                              a culture of accountability and personal responsibility at Hope. Certain safeguards
                              work together to mitigate the spread of COVID-19, and every person on campus will
                              be asked to fully participate in our mitigation strategy so that we have the best
                              chance of remaining in-person, on campus for as long as possible.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p>As we get closer to the beginning of the academic year, we will be issuing more detailed
                              guidelines about our shared commitment to living and learning on campus, including
                              our specific responsibilities to one another and to our community. Until then, we
                              are developing a framework with the following assumptions:
                           </p>
                           
                           <ul>
                              
                              <li><strong>Distancing</strong>: We will do our best to physically distance from one another whenever possible. We
                                 understand that there are some situations where we may not be able to maintain a 6-foot
                                 distance, and in these situations, the use of face coverings is especially critical.
                              </li>
                              
                              <li><strong>Face covering</strong>s: We will wear face coverings in public spaces, classrooms and common areas, as well
                                 as any close-quarters situation where we cannot maintain a 6-foot distance. Face masks
                                 will be provided to the campus community, and face shields will be available and used
                                 where appropriate.&nbsp;(See additional information in "On Campus? Wear a Face Covering"

                              <li><strong>Hygiene</strong>: We will wash our hands often with soap and water, or use hand sanitizer.
                              </li>
                              
                              <li><strong>Cleaning</strong>: We will play an active role in keeping our areas clean. This may entail wiping down
                                 surfaces before and after use, as well as keeping clothing, belongings, personal spaces
                                 and shared spaces clean.

                              <li><strong>Monitoring symptoms</strong>: We will screen ourselves for the symptoms of COVID-19 on a daily basis, and if symptoms
                                 are present, will: 1) stay home from classes and work, and 2) report to a medical
                                 professional or the Health Center.

                           <p><strong>Help us build a healthy community based on personal responsibility.</strong> As the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) says: <em>Your face covering may protect them. Their face covering may protect you.</em> In the article “<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/coronavirus/in-depth/coronavirus-mask/art-20485449">How much protection do face masks offer?</a>,”&nbsp;the Mayo Clinic explains the importance of face coverings. For more information,
                              check out the CDC’s online resource, <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/diy-cloth-face-coverings.html">Use of Cloth Face Coverings to Help Slow the Spread of COVID-19</a>, which includes details about making, wearing and washing face coverings.

                           <p><strong>Confused about whether or not you should be wearing a face covering? Let’s clear up
                                 the confusion!</strong> All students, employees and visitors must wear a covering over their nose and mouth
                              at all times while on campus unless they are: 1) in their private living space; or
                              2) the sole occupant of an enclosed office; or 3) outdoors and continually more than
                              6 feet from every other person.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p><strong>Don’t be afraid to ask.</strong> Face coverings play a critical role in mitigating the spread of COVID-19. We all
                              help build a healthy campus by wearing face coverings <em>and</em> encouraging others to do the same.

                                 awkward, but in doing so, you are increasing our chances of remaining healthy and

                              recreational activities will look different. While we are still working on the details
                              — and will be throughout the summer — we can offer a preview of housing and dining
                              in the fall:
                           </p>

                              <li><strong>Housing cohorts</strong>: One important aspect of residential life will be Hope housing cohorts, small groups
                                 of students united as a community by their housing location, such as a cottage, residential
                                 hall floor/cluster or apartment. These cohorts will serve as a point of connection
                                 and engagement for residents. Together, cohort members will create and honor expectations
                                 for living in their shared space, with the goal of ensuring a sense of both security
                                 and comfort in their home. We will continue to provide details about how housing cohorts
                                 will operate. We also are working on guidelines for shared areas in residence halls,
                                 such as bathrooms and lounges.
                              </li>
                              
                              <li><strong>Isolation/Quarantine housing</strong>: We are working to designate and prepare the spaces on campus that will serve as
                                 housing for students that are in isolation or in quarantine due to a potential or
                                 confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis. In these situations, we would make accommodations so
                                 that students could continue to progress in their coursework.

                              <li><strong>Move-in</strong>: We are planning a staggered, phased move-in for students living on campus. This
                                 means that the move-in schedule will take place over a longer period of time than
                                 usual. Watch your email for more details regarding move-in plans.

                              <li><strong>Dining</strong>: At Hope, we value the tradition of eating with our community, and we are working
                                 to keep that tradition available and safe for all. As our Dining Services team develops
                                 our on-campus dining plan for the fall semester, we are following all Michigan restaurant
                                 requirements and all Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommendations.
                                 We also are working with local health officials to understand additional needs for
                                 dining areas. Options will include on-site dining, with specific protocols for distancing
                                 and cleaning, as well as to-go dining. Currently, we are exploring possibilities for
                                 online ordering. As always, Dining Services will continue to offer high standards
                                 for health, variety and convenience.

                           <p>Testing is just one component of an overall strategy to mitigate the spread of COVID-19.
                              We take seriously our responsibility to test any student who is symptomatic, and we
                              urge students to take seriously their responsibility to monitor themselves for COVID-19
                              symptoms. If students experience any symptoms, they should contact the Health Center
                              immediately — and never wait for the symptoms to get worse. We will have formal processes
                              in place for this kind of diagnostic testing, and will share more about those processes
                              as we finalize details.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p>“Baseline testing” is a form of screening that involves testing individuals who are
                              not symptomatic, in order to find unrecognized cases of disease. Asymptomatic baseline
                              testing alone does not serve as a preventative measure, as it captures only a moment
                              in time. And, because false positives and false negatives continue to be a challenge,
                              asymptomatic testing must be managed carefully. We are still finalizing our approach
                              to asymptomatic testing, and will be sharing those details soon as well.

                           <p>A recently approved temporary adaptation of Hope’s Pass/Fail Option Policy <strong>will allow all students to request pass-fail (P/F) options for any or all full-semester
                                 and last-half semester Spring 2020 courses</strong>; there will be no changes to courses that were taken in the first-half of the semester,
                              which ended on Wednesday, February 26, 2020.

                           <p>For many students, taking letter grades off the table reduced pressure and allowed
                              them to focus on their learning. For some, earning reported letter grades was important
                              or even necessary based on specific circumstances, including academic programs that
                              have highly sequenced, grade-dependent prerequisites or were externally accredited
                              programs where external requirements may not allow P/F courses in the major. The hope
                              was that this adaptation provided the balance everyone needed while also alleviating
                              at least some of the anxiety everyone was feeling during this challenging semester.
