<h3>5/29/20 - Message to Students and Parents regarding the King’s College CARES Act Emergency Grant</h3>
<div>
<p>To Students and their Families:</p>

<p>The recently enacted Coronavirus Aid, Relief, And Economic Security (CARES) Act provides a Higher Education Emergency Relief Fund (HEERF) designated to assist students in the form of direct grants. The grants to students “…for expenses related to disruptions to their educations due to the COVID-19 outbreak, including things like course materials and technology as well as food, housing, health care, and childcare." King’s College created the CARES Act Emergency Grant to make qualified grants to students.</p>

<p>The Act requires schools to document and report justification for grant expenditures. All eligible students should report individual student expenses using a simple online application available by clicking this link <a href="https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=Caz6k9pHhkG-IxMAQ7s0GMCnouNxMrpGiImvuUoaYKRURUJLQ0ZVSUMzUkRXU0FQUU9BVVBZUVJFTy4u">CARES Act Emergency Application. </a>Receipts for expenses are not required. You can find additional information on our website <a href="https://www.kings.edu/admissions/financial_aid/cares-act">CARES Act Emergency Grant.</a> You should review this information before starting an application.</p>

<p>We anticipate making our first round of grants to students on June 5, 2020, for applications received by midnight, June 3, 2020.</p>

<h3>5/11/20 - Message to the Graduates of the Class of 2020</h3>
<div>
<p>Congratulations on your successful completion of the graduation requirements! Your collegiate experience has been indelibly marked by the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic. We at King’s College are deeply proud of your accomplishment. Please read this important message concerning matters related to the celebration of your accomplishments. </p>

<p><strong>Honoring Hope Bearers:</strong> On Saturday, May 16th at 4 PM, Fr. Jack Ryan, CSC, President, will celebrate Mass in the Chapel of Christ the King. This Mass honors all the members of our King’s College community who have labored under challenging circumstances to complete the work of the 2019-2020 Academic Year, especially the Members of the Class of 2020. On Thursday, May 14th, an email containing the liturgical program, featuring the names of the Members of the Class of 2020 will be sent to you. Please join us for the Mass via livestream at: <a href="https://www.kings.edu/chapel-stream.">https://www.kings.edu/chapel-stream.</a> If you can’t join us for the livestream it will be posted on the Campus Ministry Facebook Page. </p>


<p><strong>Mailing of Diplomas:</strong> The diplomas for all who have successfully completed graduation requirements will be mailed to the address that you provided when you registered for commencement. The mailing begins in May 18th. </p>

<p><strong>Caps and Gowns: </strong>If you ordered a cap and gown for commencement, it will be mailed by Herff-Jones to the address you provided. Any questions related to your cap and gown order or other items purchased from Herff-Jones may be directed to Chris Urban at <a href="mailto" curban="">curban@herffjones.com.</a></p>

<p><strong>Alumni Recognition and Celebration:</strong> One of the ways that we will be celebrating this week is through the 20 for ’20 initiative. The Institutional Advancement team has gathered a moving collection of words of support from our alumni and friends to welcome you to the alumni family. Throughout this week, these messages will be shared with you through the College’s Alumni and Friends Facebook and Instagram accounts. Another fun component to the graduation experience is the annual “Welcome to the Alumni Family” gift that is traditionally shared with our graduates on commencement day. Because this is no typical graduation year, this will be no typical graduation gift. More to come on this year’s gift to our seniors. </p>

<p><strong>August Commencement:</strong> With each passing day, the leadership of King’s College seeks to respond to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our community with the priority of ensuring the health, safety and well-being of all our students, faculty, staff and administrators. As you well know, we have constructed a plan for the in-person celebration of your graduation in August including a series of key events: Commencement Ball, the Baccalaureate Mass, the Alumni Gathering and Commencement at the Mohegan Sun Arena. We hoped to provide as full a celebration as possible for you. At present, that plan remains in place. It is very likely, however, that due to concerns for your safety and well-being and that of your families and friends that we may need to hold Commencement in August in a virtual environment. Please be assured that we will make that determination in a thoughtful and prudent manner and inform you as soon as a decision is made.</p>
</div>
<h3>5/6/20 - Update for Resident Students</h3>
<div>
<p>Dear Students,</p>

<p>I know that you all are anxious to return to campus to collect your belongings and I want to thank you
for your patience during this time. Unfortunately, Governor Wolf’s shelter-in-place order has not yet
been lifted for Luzerne County. As a result, we cannot yet permit anyone back to campus to clean out
their rooms. Please do not come to campus, as you will not be permitted into your residence hall.</p>

<p>Once the order for Luzerne County is lifted, or another form of permission is granted by state
authorities, Residence Life will share our full move-out plan for a safe and orderly return to campus. I
want to give you a sense of the plan, and what you should expect when the time comes. In the interest
of public safety and public health, the following steps will be put into place:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Students will sign up for a 2-hour time block on a specific day. Given our plan and the number of
	students who need to move out, it is extremely important that you return to retrieve your
	belongings on the date and time that you registered for. You will be able to reschedule your
	time if necessary. For your and everyone’s safety, please do not come to campus without a
	confirmed registration date and time.</li>
	<li>You will be permitted to bring one person with you to assist with moving out.</li>
	<li>You will not be able to move out at the same time as your roommate(s), so please communicate
	with each other as you each schedule you 2-hour block of time.</li>
	<li>You will need to bring your own trash bags, boxes, hand trucks, etc. A very limited number of
	carts will be available throughout the buildings (except in Flood Hall) so know that in planning
	your pack and carry actions.</li>
</ul>
<p>I want to thank you in advance for working to comply with our efforts to keep all our students, staff and
families safe.</p>

<p>Again, once the governor’s order for Luzerne County is lifted, or another form of permission is granted
by state authorities, we will promptly email students with the very specific details of our move out plan.
Once you receive our email, please register for your 2-hour time slot. We are counting on you to follow
through with it for efficiency’s sake!</p>

<p>I hope you and your families are well and wish you the best of luck on completing your finals!</p>
<p>For the College,<br />
Megan M. Casey<br />
Associate Dean of Students for Residence Life</p>

	<h3>4/9/20 - Monetary Adjustments - Update for Students</h3>

	<div>
		<p>Dear Students,</p>

		<p>On Tuesday, March 24, President Fr. Ryan announced our decision to provide pro-rated adjustments for room and board charges already paid for the spring semester.</p>

		<p>Recognizing the challenges each family may be facing now, the college has completed its analysis and will be processing the monetary adjustments for your room, board, and parking charges for the time you did not have use of these services over the semester. The adjustments will be first applied to any outstanding student account balances, and the remainder will be applied towards your fall 2020 semester. Seniors with a credit balance due to them after they have achieved financial clearance on their accounts, will receive a check mailed to their home address.</p>

		<p>All monetary adjustments will be completed no later than April 30, 2020. If you have any questions regarding your account, please contact <a href="mailto:businessofficestaff@kings.edu">businessofficestaff@kings.edu.</a></p>

		<p>Thank you for your patience as we worked through this process. We wish you every success through the remainder of this semester and beyond.</p>

		<p>We continue to keep you and your families in our thoughts.</p>

	<h3>4/6/20 - Message from the President: Rescheduling of Commencement Day Ceremonies</h3>

	<div>
		<p>Dear Members of the Class of 2020,</p>

		<p>One of my greatest privileges and personal joys as president of King’s College is the opportunity to shake the hand of each graduate who walks across the stage on Commencement Day. I write to inform you that we at King’s College have every intention of celebrating, and celebrating with joy, your respective accomplishments as graduates of King’s College. Due to the coronavirus pandemic I am announcing that we are rescheduling commencement to Sunday, August the 16th in the Mohegan Sun Arena. This rescheduling of the commencement celebration will happen if there is a relaxation of social distancing guidelines by August 16th.</p>

		<p>I imagine that it has been—and continues to be—a hardship for each of you to have let go of so many of the important experiences and landmark moments of a senior year in college. By moving the commencement exercises to August, we at King’s College wish to provide you with an opportunity to engage some of those important landmark moments.</p>

		<p>Thus, the traditional Commencement Ball will be held on the evening of Friday, August the 14th. The following day, Saturday the 15th, rehearsal for the Commencement Ceremony will take place in the morning, after which graduates are welcome to attend either a cookout with classmates and invited faculty and staff or a student-athlete luncheon. Later that afternoon, we will celebrate the Baccalaureate Mass, in which we as a community of scholarship and faith give thanks and praise to almighty God for your accomplishments and in hope of the good that you will do in the world. Later that evening the Institutional Advancement Office will host its traditional festive gathering for you, your family and friends in Regina Court and in Connerton's Cafe. And, of course, the Commencement Exercises will be held on Sunday August 16th at the Mohegan Sun Arena.</p>

		<p>In addition, we will host in our residence halls those of you who resided in campus housing or in off-campus housing this past semester, without cost during this August Commencement Weekend.</p>

		<p>Graduating from King’s College is a significant accomplishment. Your perseverance toward graduation in these unprecedented times will mark your graduation day not only with a sense of accomplishment, but also of hope. Your embrace of the unique challenges of your senior year will have marked you as a bearer of hope for others. Your graduation will witness to others that challenges can be faced and overcome, and that new life emerges from the struggles that we face together. Words cannot express how deeply I look forward to celebrating with you.</p>

		<p>Sincerely yours,</p>

		<p>Rev. John J. Ryan, CSC<br />
			President</p>

	<h3>3/31/20 - President's Message to Alumni and Friends</h3>

	<div>
		<p>Dear Alumni &amp; Friends:</p>

		<p>Times like these find us reaching for <strong>hope</strong>. Times like these find us reaching for <strong><em>hope-bearers.</em></strong></p>

		<p>In recent days, we see everyday heroes answer the call to help a neighbor, support a community, and care for our most vulnerable. I am so grateful for them. I pray for them and their families.</p>

		<p>At King’s, these days have revealed so many members of our campus community who stand up, make the extra effort, and do all they can to ensure <strong>the mission advances.</strong> I am so proud of them; our faculty continue to teach and our students continue to learn. We may be using different forms of delivery and communication in teaching and learning, but <strong>our mission endures.</strong></p>

		<p>As our campus dramatically transitions, I think of the many additional challenges our students face and how this environment adds even greater pressures to them. In more normal circumstances, too many King’s students face obstacles beyond their control. Not having enough food to eat. Not having a place away from campus to call home. Not having the resources to buy books. Not having the funds to pay tuition. The <strong>Presidential Hope Fund</strong> has filled these gaps for more than 650 young Monarchs. <strong><em>People like YOU have filled these gaps for our young women and men.</em></strong></p>

		<p>In this time of crisis, the Presidential Hope Fund has served as a stabilizing force for many of our students. Just within the last week, we have granted several requests to help struggling students fill tuition deficits. More need will arise. There will be more requests for help.</p>

		<p>We have also learned of new student needs. For example, as the College has pivoted to teaching and learning remotely, we found that some students lack the technology (and the resources to purchase it) to continue their studies online. To address this challenge, <strong>I have allocated Presidential Hope Fund dollars to purchase laptops for loaning to students who need them.</strong> Thanks to so many of you, we have found yet another way to meet the foundational needs of any student who qualifies.</p>

		<p>Because of Presidential Hope Fund supporters – <strong><em>because of our hope-bearers</em></strong> – I am confident that young women and men who are working hard to earn a King’s degree will get the support they need to make it happen, no matter the changing environment. <strong>Thank you.</strong></p>

		<p>As our students continue to adapt to this uncertain world, so do we.<strong> In times like these, </strong><em>I am ever more focused on our students.<strong> In times like these, I am ever more grateful for you.</strong></em></p>

		<p>Please know that you and your family are in my prayers.</p>

		<p>Peace and blessings,</p>

		<p>Fr. Jack Ryan, C.S.C., Ph.D.<br />
			President</p>

		<p>*If you would like to support the Presidential Hope Fund, <a href="https://securelb.imodules.com/s/73/k19/interior.aspx?sid=73&amp;gid=1&amp;pgid=522&amp;cid=1235&amp;fid=1235">you may do so here.</a> Thank you.</p>
	</div>

	<h3>3/25/20 - Message to Resident Students</h3>

	<div>
		<p>Dear Resident Students,</p>

		<p>I know you have seen Fr. Jack Ryan's email cancelling in-person classes for the remainder of the spring semester and would like to come to campus to clean out your rooms and collect the rest of your belongings. Rest assured, your belongings are secure in your rooms and buildings and Residence Life is developing a plan for your safe and orderly return to campus to collect your things.</p>

		<p>Currently, Gov. Wolf maintains his order requiring closure of all non-life sustaining businesses, an order which includes colleges and universities. College employees are working remotely, and the physical plant of the College is closed. In light of this order, we are currently unable to provide specific dates for your return to campus. Once the order is lifted, the College will determine dates that students will be permitted to return to campus. We will email you this plan, with instructions for compliance, and it will also be posted on the College’s webpage for all COVID-19 information.</p>

		<p>Please do not come to campus, as you will not be permitted into your building.</p>

		<p>If you have any questions, please don’t hesitate to contact reslife@kings.edu. Thank you for your patience and cooperation in this endeavor, please stay well and best wishes in completing your spring semester classes.</p>

		<p>Megan M. Casey<br />
			Associate Dean of Students for Residence Life</p>
	</div>

	<h3>3/24/20 - Message from the President</h3>

	<div>
		<p>Dear Members of the King’s College Community,</p>

		<p>On March 11, I wrote to you with the decision to suspend in-person classes and resume them through distance modalities. At that time, we announced that distance learning would occur though at least April 13.  Since that announcement, the number of COVID-19 cases has continued to increase, especially in the mid-Atlantic states – our home area. Additional restrictions to business operations and personal movement have been requested and required by the state of Pennsylvania.  Throughout this time, King’s College has continued its commitment to mitigate risk to the health and welfare of the entire King’s College Community. I would like to thank all of you for your understanding and for your excellent work as we have made necessary changes.</p>

		<p>Among public announcements, one of the most notable for our College is the March 15 recommendation issued by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) that no gatherings with 50 or more people be held for the next eight weeks.  Informed by this recommendation, I have decided to extend the in-person suspension of classes at King’s College through the end of the spring semester. All courses will continue through distance learning during this time.</p>

		<p>With the announcement of the suspension of in-person classes, I am sure that there is an array of questions. For resident students, please know that our Student Affairs team is working on plans for you to come to campus and retrieve the rest of your belongings. This will take some time, since on-campus operations are closed in support of the Governor’s order to limit activities of non-life sustaining businesses. Additionally, resident students need to know that the College will pro-rate room and/or board charges for the spring semester. I thank all our students and their families for their patience as we work through this process. Members of our Business Affairs team are working through this process and will communicate more details as soon as they are available.</p>

		<p>In conjunction with the CDC guidance, no College events will be held through May 10. Commencement is scheduled for May 17. At present, I think it premature to make a final decision on holding an in-person Commencement on May 17. Each year, we look forward to celebrating and recognizing the accomplishments of our students in community at the May Commencement. The events create cherished memories for family and friends. We will continue to monitor the situation and communicate a final decision as soon as possible. I would like to assure our seniors and all members of our community that in the event we are unable to hold an in-person Commencement in May, we will do everything possible to find an alternative way to provide students with an opportunity to come together, spend time with one another, and celebrate with family and friends.</p>

		<p>Since our classes resumed through distance learning on March 19, I have been impressed and inspired by the dedication, flexibility, and creativity of our faculty, staff, and students. I have heard wonderful success stories of members across our community adapting to this new environment, continuing to fulfill our enduring educational mission —namely, to pursue excellence in teaching, learning, and scholarship through a rigorous core curriculum, major programs across the liberal arts and sciences, nationally-accredited professional programs at the undergraduate and graduate levels, and personal attention to student formation in a nurturing community.  This mission continues to flourish because of your excellent work and your determination.</p>

		<p>To summarize:</p>

		<ul>
			<li>In-person classes are suspended through the remainder of the semester.  Distance learning will continue in all courses. </li>
			<li>No College events will be held through May 10, 2020.</li>
			<li>The College has not reached a final decision on whether it will hold Commencement on May 17. A decision will be communicated as soon as possible.</li>
			<li>The College will pro-rate room and/or board charges to resident students. Business Affairs will develop a plan and communicate it to our resident students.  Please direct questions to our Business Affairs Office (<a href="mailto:janetkobylski@kings.edu">janetkobylski@kings.edu</a>) . We thank students and families for their patience as we work through this process.</li>
			<li>Student Affairs will communicate to resident students a plan for moving out of the residence halls. This is complicated by current state restrictions on operations, and so again we thank our students and families for their patience and understanding.  Please direct questions to our Student Affairs team (<a href="mailto:RobertMcGonigle@kings.edu">RobertMcGonigle@kings.edu</a>).</li>
		</ul>

		<p>Each day, members of the Holy Cross Community and I are praying for you, for your families, for the community of health care providers, and for all those whose extraordinary work is critical during this time. On Sunday, March 29th, I will celebrate Mass in the Chapel of Christ the King for you, and your loved ones. Please join together with me through your livestream. I look forward to the day when we can return to campus, and person to person, continue our important work.</p>

		<p>Sincerely,</p>

		<p>Fr. Jack Ryan, CSC<br />
			President</p>

	<h3>3/20/20 - Update for Students</h3>

	<div>
		<p>Dear King’s Student,</p>

		<p>As the College’s leadership continues to implement best practices related to the containment of the spread of COVID-19, and to ensure optimal distance education, please know of our concern for you during this unsettling time.

	<h3>3/18/20 - Message from the President</h3>

	<div>
		<p>Dear Alumni and Friends:</p>

		<p>We find ourselves in an extraordinary time. COVID-19, the novel coronavirus, has changed our world, and it has done so quickly. Each of our lives – and the lives of each of our neighbors both near and far – has been disrupted in profound ways. I pray that this message finds you and your family safe and healthy. I write to connect with you, let you know that we are praying for you and your family, and share with you steps that King’s has taken to respond to this challenge.</p>

		<p><strong>The safety and well-being of the King’s family is my top priority. </strong>In the interest of our campus community’s safety – based on the guidance of experts, government leaders, and other key advisors – we have taken quick action to modify much of our school’s work, most notably teaching and learning. A few key actions taken:</p>

		<ul>
			<li>Suspended all in-person classes at least through April 13 (effective end of day on Wednesday, March 11).</li>
			<li>Resuming in-person classes through an on-line format beginning tomorrow (March 19).</li>
			<li>Directed all residence hall students to return home to be with their families (no later than Saturday, March 14). Of course, we have made provisions for the limited number of students who do not have somewhere to go.</li>
			<li>Transitioning all employees whose work does not require them to be at a campus facility to working remotely (effective today, March 18).</li>
			<li>Cancelling or postponing all College events and College travel at least through April 13. This includes the cancellation of all athletic and alumni events. The President’s Dinner (scheduled for April 18) has also been cancelled.</li>
			<li>Following direction by the Diocese of Scranton, Masses will continue each weekday at 12:05 p.m., but will only be available online via live-streaming. A link to the live-stream can be found here: <a href="https://www.kings.edu/chapel-stream">https://www.kings.edu/chapel-stream.</a> This includes the live-streaming of the next monthly Alumni Memorial Mass, which is scheduled for tomorrow (March 19) at 12:05 p.m.</li>
		</ul>

		<p>Please know that despite these disruptions we continue to operate – our teachers will be teaching, our students will be learning, and our staff, administrators, and Holy Cross priests and brothers will continue their service. The members of our Campus Ministry and Institutional Advancement teams remain available to support you however we can. For <strong>Campus Ministry services, </strong>please contact Fr. Thomas Looney, C.S.C., at <a href="mailto:thomaslooney@kings.edu">thomaslooney@kings.edu</a> or Fr. Jarrod Waugh, C.S.C., at <a href="jarrodwaugh@kings.edu">jarrodwaugh@kings.edu. </a><strong>For Alumni Relations services,</strong> please contact Beth Doherty at <a href="alumni@kings.edu">alumni@kings.edu</a> or (570) 208-5900 ext. 5732. We will continue to assess and evaluate circumstances as they arise, and we will continue to communicate about alumni-related programming and events as appropriate.</p>

		<p>I appreciate that we encounter these challenges during the sacred season of Lent. I hope that our daily Lenten reflections serve as a source of comfort and peace. They will continue daily through Lent. From March 17 through March 25 we are participating in a novena to Blessed Basile Moreau, founder of the Congregation of Holy Cross, for the healing of those who have contracted the coronavirus. It is important that we find quiet moments of reflection and prayer in these days. Please pray for those afflicted. Please pray for those who care for the sick and suffering. Please pray for our students and their families.</p>

		<p>I am so impressed by and grateful for the extraordinary effort, resourcefulness, goodwill, and grace demonstrated in these past days by our students, staff, faculty, administrators, parents, alumni, and my brothers in Holy Cross. This is a time like none of us have experienced before. It has been challenging, and it will continue to be challenging. <strong>No matter the challenge, however, together we will persevere. Our mission deserves it. <em>Our mission demands it.</em> </strong></p>

		<p>As I reflect upon who we are, what we do, and how we proceed onward in the face of adversity, I think of important language proclaiming the vision for our beloved school:</p>

		<p><em>Inspired by the teaching and example of its namesake, Christ the King, who taught by example and ruled by love, King’s forms graduates who will champion the inherent dignity of every person and will mobilize their talents and professional skills to serve the common good.</em></p>

		<p>You, my dear alumni, are those graduates. You, my dear friends, are our partners in this mission. I pray that you each find your path to serve the common good in these perilous times. <strong><em>Our world needs you.</em></strong></p>

		<p>Peace and blessings,</p>

	<h3>3/11/20 - Message from the President</h3>

	<div>
		<p>Dear Members of the King’s College Community,</p>

		<p>I have no doubt that you have all been following the latest information regarding COVID-19, a coronavirus, and how it is affecting our nation and the world. While there are currently no confirmed cases here at King’s College or in our local community, the associated uncertainty has created anxiety and a need to act with an abundance of caution.</p>

		<p>As a result, and because of our concern and our desire to mitigate risk to the health and welfare of the entire King’s College Community, the College has made the difficult decision to suspend in-person classes effective at the end of the day today, Wednesday, March 11. In-person classes will resume through distance learning on Thursday, March 19. Offering of classes through distance learning will continue at least through Easter Break, which ends on Monday, April 13. The College will continue to evaluate the situation and update the entire College Community on the status of in-person instruction.</p>

		<p>Courses that are currently conducted online will continue as scheduled. The College will remain open during this period and beyond, and faculty and staff should report to campus as usual, beginning tomorrow, Thursday, March 12. This upcoming one-week period can provide faculty and staff with the opportunity to collaborate towards the continuation of our academic endeavors through distance modalities. Faculty have already begun planning for this, and they will be communicating with students in their courses on how their coursework will continue.</p>

		<p>Many students are currently participating in clinicals, internships for credit, or student teaching assignments. Our current plan is that these will continue as long as the host institutions are operating.</p>

		<p>Resident students will be asked to leave the campus by Saturday, March 14 at 3:00 PM. We recognize that not all students are in a position to leave college housing. A process will be in place for students who need to stay in on-campus housing to request this opportunity. Details will be forthcoming from the Office of Residence Life.</p>

		<p>The College will report on implications for athletics in the next day or two. Leaders of institutions in the MAC Conference are working together towards the best interests of our student athletes.</p>

		<p>The College also recognizes a need to further update its policies on travel and events. These will be forthcoming later in the week.</p>

		<p>Please know that this has been a difficult decision, and that I understand the additional unknowns that this decision may present. Success will require flexibility, tolerance for ambiguity, and good communication and collaboration from all of us. Our commitment to the pursuit of learning should aid us in this time. I am sure that there are many additional questions. Further statements will be forthcoming from campus leaders.</p>

		<p>To summarize:</p>

		<ul>
			<li>In-person classes are suspended effective at the end of the day today, Wednesday, March 11.</li>
			<li>Classes currently online continue as scheduled.</li>
			<li>In-person classes will resume through distance education on Thursday, March 19. Faculty will be in touch with information about how their individual classes will operate. These classes will continue to operate this way through at least Easter Break, which ends on Monday, April 13. Updates will be provided in time.</li>
			<li>Beginning tomorrow, Thursday, March 12 and moving forward, College employees, including faculty, should report as scheduled.</li>
			<li>For-credit Internships, Clinicals, and Student teaching may continue as long as the associated institutions are operating.</li>
			<li>Resident students are asked to leave college housing by 3:00 PM on Saturday. There will be a process for students who need to stay to make such requests.</li>
			<li>An update on implications for athletics will be provided in the next day or two.</li>
			<li>Updated policies on travel and events will be forthcoming.</li>
			<li>Updated statements from college leadership will be forthcoming as needed.</li>
			<li>Students are to check their course Moodle sites and email regularly for updates from instructors and from the College.</li>
		</ul>

		<p>Thank you again and know of my prayers for you, for your families, and for our community during this challenging time.</p>

		<p>Sincerely,<br />
			Fr. Jack Ryan, CSC<br />
			President</p>
