          <h3 class="h4">What should I do if I think I have symptoms of COVID-19?</h3>

<p>If you have been around someone diagnosed with COVID-19 and are experiencing symptoms, call&nbsp;your healthcare provider, and follow the <a href="https://www.doh.wa.gov/Portals/1/Documents/1600/coronavirus/COVIDcasepositive.pdf">procedures outlined here</a>.</p>

<p>If you have not&nbsp;been around someone diagnosed with COVID-19 but are experiencing symptoms, follow the <a href="https://www.doh.wa.gov/Portals/1/Documents/1600/coronavirus/COVIDconcerned.pdf">procedures outline here</a>.</p>

<p>If you have confirmed or suspected COVID-19 disease, call your healthcare provider, and follow the <a href="https://www.doh.wa.gov/Portals/1/Documents/1600/coronavirus/COVIDcasepositive.pdf">procedures outlined here</a>.</p>

<h3 class="h4">What is the difference between isolation, self-quarantine, and medical quarantine?</h3>

<p>Medical quarantine and isolation are used for people who are currently ill and able to spread the disease and who need to stay away from others in order to avoid infecting them. People under medical quarantine are under the supervision of medical professionals in a hospital or being checked on by medical professionals in their homes.</p>

<p>Self-quarantine is for people who have no symptoms, but because there is a possibility that they might have been exposed, they stay away from others in public settings. For 14 days from their last possible exposure, people in self-quarantine cannot go to work, school, or any public places where they could have close contact with others. Public health departments direct them in how to monitor their health so that should they develop symptoms, they can be quickly and safely isolated from all others, including those in their household.</p>

<h3 class="h4">What if I am sick, but don&#39;t have the symptoms of COVID-19?</h3>

<p>If you are sick, but aren&#39;t experiencing COVID-19 symptoms, stay away from others in public settings. Do not go to work, school, or public areas. Stay home, in a separate room if possible, except to receive medical care. Monitor your symptoms and call your healthcare provider.</p>
<!--
<h3 class="h4">Should I return to campus after Spring Break?</h3>

<p><b>While the campus is open</b>, including residence halls, the cafeteria, and all university offices, <b>students are not required to return to campus as class sessions for the remainder of this semester will be conducted remotely</b>. Many students may want to return to their homes after Spring Break, but all are welcome on campus. Student leaders and student workers should check with their supervisor about any changes to responsibilities and whether or not they can fulfill their responsibilities remotely.</p>
--><!--
<h3 class="h4">Do I need permission to work from home?</h3>

<p>Employees should check with their supervisors about whether they can work from home. The Senior Leadership Team will work with supervisors to determine which employees are eligible for telecommuting.</p>
-->

<h3 class="h4">Is the Northwest University campus still open?</h3>

<p>Offices and classrooms on campus are currently closed. The will reopen at the start of the Fall 2020 semester. The University mailroom remains open, Monday through Friday, 9:00&ndash;11:00 AM and 1:30&ndash;4:00 PM. You may enter the Barton building through the lower level southwest entry door with your card key. All university employees are working regular hours from home. If you do not know a particular office phone number, you can get to any employee through the university switchboard at&nbsp;<strong>(425) 822-8266</strong>, leaving a voicemail that will be routed to the appropriate office. You may also leave an email at&nbsp;<a href="mailto:info@northwestu.edu">info@northwestu.edu</a>. Employees are getting paid to work, and they will be happy to assist you in a timely manner. Employees with keys may use them to access their offices if needed. Essential services like custodial, food service, maintenance, and security will continue to function during this time.</p>

<h3 class="h4">What should students do who are experiencing the specific symptoms of COVID-19 (fever, cough, and/or shortness of breath)?</h3>

<p>Call the Wellness Center at <b>(425) 889-5282</b> to receive advice about what to do. If symptoms occur outside of the Wellness Center&#39;s regular hours, students may call the 24-hour free nurse hotline at <b>(425) 899-3000</b> for advice.</p>

<h3 class="h4">What should I do if I work for an outsourcing partner?</h3>

<p>Employees of our outsourcing partners should contact their employer for guidance.</p>

<h3 class="h4">What guides the decisions of the University in deciding whether to remain open?</h3>

<p>The University will stay in communication with and will carefully follow all directives of the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and Public Health&mdash;Seattle &amp; King County.</p>

<h3 class="h4">What will happen if a confirmed case of COVID-19 occurs on the Northwest University campus?</h3>

<p>We will immediately inform Public Health&mdash;Seattle &amp; King County and follow their directives.</p>

<h3 class="h4">Who should I trust for accurate information about COVID-19?</h3>

<p>We encourage everyone to stay current with the information available on the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html">CDC&#39;s website</a>&nbsp;and/or <a href="https://www.kingcounty.gov/depts/health/communicable-diseases/disease-control/novel-coronavirus.aspx">Public Health&mdash;Seattle &amp; King County</a>.</p>

<h3 class="h4">Will student group travel be cancelled?</h3>

<p>We will announce decisions about&nbsp;travel plans for student groups as information becomes available. Currently, the CDC does not recommend international travel.</p>

<h3 class="h4">Are Chinese or other Asian people more contagious than others?</h3>

<p>Please be careful not to treat anyone with prejudice during this time of uncertainty. Ethnicity has nothing to do with exposure to the novel coronavirus 2019. <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/about/related-stigma.html">According to the CDC</a>, &quot;People&mdash;including those of Asian descent&mdash;who have not recently been in an area of ongoing spread of COVID-19 or been in contact with a person who is a confirmed or suspected case of COVID-19 are not at greater risk of acquiring and spreading COVID-19 than other Americans.&quot;</p>

<h3 class="h4">Should I self-quarantine?</h3>

<p>Since it is cold, flu, and allergy season, many people in our community have cold or other respiratory symptoms and many people are choosing to play it safe. You should self-quarantine if you have fever, cough, and shortness of breath or contact with a person who has been exposed to COVID-19.&nbsp;&nbsp;If you are an employee, you must also notify your supervisor and the Senior Administrator over your area. If you are a student, you should notify all your professors so they will not mark you absent from class. Professors have been advised to excuse absences of anyone who may be unable to join class due to any kind of illness.</p>

<h3 class="h4">Should I take sick leave if I stay home from work?</h3>

<p>If you are a Northwest University employee and you need to take time off due to symptoms, report the time as sick leave. We will be generous in dealing with sick leave as the situation continues. Do not worry that you will run out of sick leave.</p>

<h3 class="h4">Should I visit the Wellness Center to receive treatment?</h3>

<p>Please call the Wellness Center at <b>(425) 889-5282</b> first rather than just showing up unannounced. They will want to prepare you with instructions to serve you best.</p>

<h3 class="h4">What should I do personally to avoid contracting the virus?</h3>

<ol>
	<li>Wash your hands frequently (although not obsessively) for at least 20 seconds, especially after shaking hands with people. It takes about 20 seconds to sing the Doxology, so take advantage of the opportunity to praise God in the midst of this circumstance (1 Thessalonians 5:16-18).</li>
	<li>Avoid touching your eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands. Cover your coughs to avoid spreading the virus.</li>
	<li>Minimize physical contact with casual acquaintances, substituting a polite nod or other gesture instead of handshakes.</li>
	<li>Avoid contact with people who are sick. If you are needed as a caregiver to someone suffering from the disease, do not return to public activity until you are cleared by medical personnel to do so.</li>
	<li>Avoid visiting hospitals, long term care facilities, or nursing homes to the extent possible. If you need to go, limit your time there and keep six feet away from patients.</li>
	<li>People at higher risk of severe illness should stay home and away from large groups of people as much as possible, including public places with lots of people and large gatherings where there will be close contact with others.</li>
</ol>

<h3 class="h4">How should I pray?</h3>

<p>Please join us in prayer that God will protect the health of each member of our community from COVID-19. Pray that everyone will defeat feelings of stress, anxiety, and fear. Pray for the administration to make wise decisions about our operations. Pray for the civil health authorities to make good decisions about how to control the spread of the virus. Pray for supply chains to be replenished with medicines and other supplies needed by people. Pray for people all over the world that we would defeat this menace and that good things may come out of our time of struggle.</p>
