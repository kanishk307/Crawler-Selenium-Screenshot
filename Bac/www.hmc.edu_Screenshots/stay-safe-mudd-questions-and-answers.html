	  	<p><strong>Q:</strong> When are students supposed to leave at the end of the semester? Are students allowed to travel over the Thanksgiving break? Are students allowed to stay on campus through final exams?</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"><strong>A:</strong> If you choose to leave campus for the Thanksgiving break, you will not be allowed to return to campus until the start of the spring term. Final assessments for all students will be given  remotely.  We believe that this measure is necessary for the safety of our community. Thanksgiving is one the busiest times for travel in the U.S., and the risk of students potentially being exposed to COVID-19 while traveling back and forth to campus is too great for us to allow them to return after they leave. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We encourage students and their families to consider carefully whether they would like to return home for the holiday this year. We are allowing students to stay on campus through the end of the fall term. However, students who elect to go home for the holiday—even if they live in Southern California—will not be allowed to return to campus and will need to complete their exams remotely. We are happy to have our students remain on campus during Thanksgiving if they would like to take their exams on campus. </span><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Students who do choose to leave November 24 will receive a room and board credit on their student account for the days not used (the time period from November 25 through December 4, the end of the semester). This will be reflected on their statement dated December 31.</span></p>

	  	<p><strong>Q:</strong> I am an International student. What happens to my visa if I choose to take a semester or year off?</p>
<p><strong>Incoming Students:</strong> If you choose to defer admittance to HMC for a year, your visa will not be impacted as you have not received one. You will not be allowed to get your visa until you attend HMC. Your SEVIS record will reflect a new start date and you will need to be issued a new I-20 or DS-2019 to show at your consular appointment.</p>
<p><strong>Returning Students:</strong> If you choose to take a semester off please be mindful of the expiration date of your current visa. If your visa expires prior to your return to campus you WILL need to apply for a new one. If you are in the USA and choose to take a semester off, you will need to leave the country as you will not be in status.</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> I am an International student. What happens to my SEVIS record if I choose to take a semester or year off?</p>
<p><strong>Incoming Students:</strong> If you submit your paperwork to the ISS, a SEVIS record will be created when all the required documents are received. If you choose to attend at a later date the program start date of your SEVIS record will be pushed back to reflect your new start date. This will preserve your I-901 fee if it has already been paid. Upon your return, you will need to submit new documentation before a new I-20 or DS-2019 is sent to you for your consular appointment.</p>
<p><strong>Returning Students:</strong> If you choose to take some time away from Mudd, your SEVIS record will be terminated for Early Authorized Withdrawal. Please keep in mind that this may affect your ability to participate in CPT, OPT and AT. For F-1 students: If you plan to return within 5 months of the date of termination, there may be a possibility to reactivate your SEVIS record. If you do not return within the 5 month window, you will need to get a new SEVIS record and your employment clock will restart and you will need to be enrolled for 9 months (one academic school year) before you are eligible for CPT/OPT again. For J-1 students: you will need to get a new SEVIS record, there is no ability to reinstate your previous record. You will need to submit new documentation before a new I-20 or DS-2019 can be issued to you. If your visa will still be valid when you return, then you will not need to apply for a new one; a valid visa is a valid visa.</p>

We will not offer every course in this format and make no guarantees that all courses necessary to each student’s progress will be available online. Students are encouraged to contact the Associate Dean of Academic Affairs or the Associate Dean of Academic Resources and Student Success with questions.

	  	<p><strong>Q:</strong> What are the consequences to students when they are found breaking safety rules? (As we all know, teenagers and young adults they will like to push boundaries, they have already been away for a long time and have lot of stress, anxiety, and would want to meet up with their friends, go for a late night run etc. etc.)</p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> This was discussed in one of the “Inside Mudd” parent’s panels. We will be working on norming practices for students to help build a culture of how to manage this situation, and reporting options. Students who do not comply will be asked to leave-campus (cannot live on-campus) for the safety of self and others.</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> How will we enforce these safety measures?</p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> We outline that in the FAQ. First this is about safety. We will engage with students and utilize the Honor Code and the res life teams will be key in this as well. Living on campus and making that choice means you have to decide that you need to live within these boundaries and rules for your own safety and the safety of others.</p>

<p><strong>A:</strong> Yes, The Office of Career Services plans to host all our career fairs and other on-campus recruiting events and interviews virtually. We are taking advantage of being virtual and are teaming up with CalTech for our career fairs this fall. In addition to our STEM and Software Engineering Virtual Career Fairs, we are also hosting a smaller Virtual Graduate School Career Fair inviting programs Mudders have applied to and attended.<br />
We understand participation in a virtual career fair will be a new experience for many of our students, therefore we will have workshops and guides prior to the events to help students prepare and stand out at these virtual events.</p>

	  	<p><strong>Q:</strong> The other Claremont Colleges appear to be on a path to reopening in the fall with students on campus, but they have not prevented their students from stepping on one another&#8217;s campuses. Why is HMC different? Why are we deviating from the rest of the consortium, and are we prepared for the longer-term social and political costs of going it alone? What is the board&#8217;s rationale in instructing the college to take this stance?</p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> Given the increasing rate of infection in the county, there is no college that truly knows right now if it will actually be allowed to have students on campus this fall. While the undergraduate campuses have been able to agree to a shared academic calendar, in other areas it has been more of a challenge because we have five colleges with five boards and five sets of faculty, staff and students and everyone has a different culture and differences of opinion about how to approach the next academic year.</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> Why are we maintaining the conceit that HMC students will isolate themselves to the HMC campus only, without crossing over to the other colleges, to the Village, or anywhere else? This is a fantasy. So much planning is being done, built on a foundation of this faulty assumption. Students&#8217; courses are going to be thrown for a loop. CMS athletics are at risk of cancellation. The other colleges aren&#8217;t taking similar positions. Instead, HMC is planning for and living in a delusional state. We&#8217;re scientists &#8212; why are we embracing magical thinking?</p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> We’ve consulted students in developing the planning scenario. They believe they can make the plans work and so do we.</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> In reference to an apparent Board directive to make our campus “HMC students only” and prevent HMC students from going off-campus in the fall, Scripps Dean of Faculty recently said “The other four [colleges] are holding hands and not thinking about [such restrictions]. We are thinking about the Claremont Colleges as the Claremont Colleges.” Can you respond to this and why the Board is not aware of the Consortial nature of our residential and educational experience?</p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> The two guiding principles that have focused our planning process are protecting the health and safety of all members of the HMC community while providing the collaborative educational experiences we treasure. We believe we can best protect the HMC community when we are able to limit its size to the 1,100 faculty, staff and students physically at HMC vs. the more than 10,000 in the entire consortium. This is a different world we are in, and while we don’t like the idea of limiting access to our campus, we believe strongly that it is necessary to protect the most vulnerable members of our community. We’re in an extremely challenging situation. There are no good answers. There is no way to make things the way we’d like for them to happen.</p>

	  	<p><strong>Q:</strong> What is going to happen with Dry Week and Wet Season?</p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> 1C/5C parties will be canceled for the fall, and possibly into the spring. Therefore, we will not have a “dry week” and “wet season” this year. When it is determined that social gatherings can happen in some form (either later this fall or next spring semester), it is important to note they will include social distancing precautions such as requirements for small numbers, face coverings, outdoor spaces, and other social distancing measures.</p>

	  	<p><strong>Q:</strong> Can we use the DSA van for shopping for groceries, going to off campus doctors, etc?</p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> This semester we will be limiting the use of the DSA van for essential purposes such as doctor visits, therapists, pharmacies and groceries. There will be no club use of the van, and as always, no personal use for non-essential purposes. All of the documents usually available in the “van binder” will be offered in digital form and students will have access to these documents via QR codes we will add in the van.</p>
<p>To adhere to CDC guidelines, we are limiting the number of passengers allowed to be in the vans. Additionally, we will provide a cleaning kit so students will be responsible for cleaning and sanitizing at the end of each trip.</p>

	  	<p><strong>Q:</strong> HMC has apparently decided to build a virtual moat around the campus, whereby students are not permitted to visit other colleges, the Village, etc., but this strikes me as unrealistic. Students have many relationships across campuses, and they overestimate their invincibility. Enforcement will be a challenge. How will this be policed? (terminology fully intended) What will the consequences be for violating the blockade?</p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> This assumes we are allowed to have students on campus. In terms of preserving safety of all members of our community, we believe it is much better if we can be a community of 1,250 than be a community of 10,000 people if we add all the faculty, staff and students for all of The Claremont Colleges. Dr. G. has been working with a 22-person student advisory board crafting the student guidelines. We believe that the more conservative we are and the more we keep our community closed to visitors, the less likely it will be to have infection spread. It’s unrealistic to say there will be no infections, but the goal is to keep the number as low as possible so that we can remain open for the full semester once we begin with students on campus. I think the vast majority of students would follow the guidelines the vast majority of the time.</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> If we are in-person/hybrid, what will be expected from faculty in terms of enforcing safety practices on campus? Will we receive training if we&#8217;re expected to do this? Will the college support us if we expel a student from our classroom for appearing sick or failing to adhere to social distancing practices?</p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> Yes. We anticipate offering online training in the two weeks prior to the beginning of the fall semester. If a student does not abide by physical distancing and mask requirements in a course, that student will not be able to take the course and will most likely be sent home.</p>

	  	<p><strong>Q:</strong> I know student extracurricular participation is an important part of the mental health of many of our students, but that many of those activities, should they come back, will be on other campuses. Are we synchronizing with other colleges at all to let our CMS athletes and musicians in the Pomona ensembles participate if these programs return?</p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> LA County Dept. of Public Health has said that they do not anticipate colleges and universities being able to offer athletics this academic year. It’s very hard to synchronize when we still have not received official guidance from the county. Each of the colleges in the consortium has been trying to adjust based on their own campus community’s needs. While we don’t have official guidance, we do expect that we likely will not be allowed to have musical groups, particularly choral and brass or woodwind instruments. In our planning, we have tried to carefully balance making difficult decisions that we know will negatively impact some of our students with the need to be thoughtful so that we can minimize the virus’s spread.</p>

<p><strong>A:</strong> Our primary reason for wanting to have students here in-person is that we heard strongly from them about how important it was for them to be able to collaborate with their classmates and how dissatisfied many were with the learning environment being totally online and their having to go home. We heard overwhelmingly that the faculty did a great job of moving online with little notice but the students found it difficult to work as hard as they wanted when they didn’t have a collaborative learning community around them. Given where things currently stand, it seems more and more likely that we may be forced to shift to online courses only for the fall. We will have to see things progress over the next several weeks. The finances of the College are impacted whether we have students in-person or not.</p>

<p><strong>A:</strong> The Community Emergency Aid Fund provides operational support to the College following the unforeseen expenditures related to the COVID-19 pandemic, specifically, the need to provide more than $3 million in room and board refunds to our students as well as the additional expenses necessary to transition to online learning for the remaining portion of the semester. More than $300,000 has been raised during the 2019–20 fiscal year, which helps offset these unforeseen expenses. In hindsight, we realize that there was some confusion about the purpose of this fund, and for that we apologize.</p>

<p><strong>A:</strong> We are hopeful that we will not be forced to have reductions in pay or furloughs, but given the unpredictable nature of the pandemic and the uncertainty around what government and public health officials will allow, we cannot predict what may happen. In the event we do have to offer fall courses online, we have committed to continuing health insurance for our staff who may have to be furloughed.

	  	<p><strong>Q:</strong> Will you consider furloughs if the students are online and in person and if so, will furloughed employees be able to receive benefits?</p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> If it is possible to have most students on campus for in-person classes this fall, we will try to avoid furloughs. If we are forced to furlough employees, our hope is that we will still be able to offer medical benefits, but not other benefits. For positions that are conducive to partial furloughs, we are looking into the possibility of using a 20% (one day a week) furlough approach. There are several positions, like our dining hall workers, who would not have work to do if most of our students are not back on campus in the fall and where partial furloughs would not work. Every Cabinet member will review the needs of their departments carefully to develop customized plans to meet the needs of our community. Again, our strong preference is that we be able to have students on campus this fall and that we not be forced to furlough employees. We would only consider this option if we are not able to have the majority of our students on campus this fall.</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> If we don’t return to campus, will the people working in Dining Services be needed? Will they be laid off or furloughed?</p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> If we are not able to bring students back to campus and provide instruction online, the dining hall will not be open and it will be unfortunately necessary to temporarily furlough most of the dining staff during the period when students are not on campus.</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> If we have furloughs, will they be complete or partial?</p>
<p><strong>A: </strong>We have spent an enormous amount of energy planning to have students back on campus this fall. Given the current situation with the pandemic, we now have to pivot and begin thinking about more detailed planning for what happens if we aren’t allowed to have students on campus this fall. For positions that are conducive to partial furloughs, we are looking into the possibility of using a 20% (one day a week) furlough approach. There are several positions, like our dining hall workers and F&amp;M residential custodial workers, who would not have work to do if most of our students are not back on campus in the fall and where partial furloughs would not work. Every Cabinet member will review the needs of their departments carefully to develop customized plans to meet the needs of our community.</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> How much notice will staff receive if they are to be furloughed partially or fully?</p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> We will make every effort to give staff as much notice as possible so that you can adequately plan.</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> If furloughed, can we cash out vacation hours?</p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> Furloughed employees are allowed to be paid for accrued time.</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> If furloughed, can employees collect unemployment?</p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> Employees can apply for unemployment and decisions to award unemployment to an individual are made by the State of California Employment Development Department (EDD).</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> If staff are furloughed, would the College continue to pay benefits?</p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> If students don’t return to campus in the fall, necessitating furloughs, your health benefits (medical, dental and vision), will continue for the fall semester. However, no other benefits, such as dependent scholarship or retirement contributions, will be provided for furloughed staff.</p>

If the college determines this option is needed, we will explore options to assist our staff to minimize the impact on benefits and credit for time of employment.</p>

<p><strong>A:</strong> We are looking into the possibility of offering a number of webinars by people who work in this area, some of them, alumni. We will plan to offer these wellness webinars to faculty, staff and students.</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> What approaches can we take to address the feelings of loneliness and isolation that our students, faculty and staff may feel during the fall semester as a result of the social distancing that is required for health and safety? Working at home or in an office with the door closed can feel very disconnected from our community and colleagues, whom we miss dearly. In general, I am worried about the mental and emotional health of our faculty and staff (and students!) and I hope that the college can be resourceful and creative in how we operate within the necessary constraints that we must have in place to keep everyone physically safe and healthy.</p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> We are looking into the possibility of offering a number of webinars by people who work in this area, some of them, alumni. We will plan to offer these wellness webinars to faculty, staff and students.</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> It appears we are taking away a great deal of what contributes to our students&#8217; personal growth and academic success during their time on campus. Moreover, we are adding measures (online learning, studying in isolation, not leaving campus) that will substantially increase their stress on campus. This is particularly true for students who experience marginalization in our community (and face a disproportionate burden of illness and death from Covid-19). Beyond teaching and staying healthy, what are we doing to help our students be successful this fall, particularly with “nurturing and developing the whole person” and “unsurpassed excellence and diversity at all levels&#8221;?</p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> In spring, we did our best to pivot and do a lot of those things—we had more students take our leadership certificate that we launched in fall. We are looking to ramp up our online co-curricular offerings that look at how we build whole person. The intergroup racial dialogue will be moved to an online format. We will continue to look at ways we can support our students, including building community and offering programming and support, using online resources.</p>

	  	<p><strong>Q:</strong> Please elaborate about the “level of pay for exempt” you mentioned when discussing minimum wage increases?</p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> California is on track to raise the minimum wage in the state to $15/hour over the course of the next few years. As the minimum wage increases, in order to qualify for exempt status, an exempt employee has to earn at least two times the state’s minimum hourly wage. As the minimum wage in California increases, we are increasing the salary of some exempt employees to ensure we remain in compliance with state law. As a result, some exempt employees will qualify for pay increases next fiscal year despite the College’s anticipated salary freeze for FY 20–21.</p>

	  	<p><strong>Q:</strong> If antibody testing becomes available, will HMC purchase the kits so we can be tested and return to work?</p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> So far, the antibody tests have not proven to be reliable. Also, there is currently no medical evidence that people who have been infected and recovered are not susceptible to future infections. Because of these factors, it is more likely right now that we will focus our efforts on testing people who may be infected and doing additional contract tracing to identify individuals with whom those individuals may have come in contact.</p>
<p>While we haven’t determined all of the procedures we will need to implement to open the campus for in-person classes this fall, our Board Chair, Wayne Drinkward ’73, has suggested that we might consider asking students to self-quarantine at home for the two weeks prior to arrival on campus and to do orientation and other activities during that time. Once students arrive on campus, we might consider asking them to participate in another two weeks of online classes only, with students quarantining in the residence halls, to minimize the risk of possible spread of infection. We do plan to have masks and thermometers available. We also are hopeful that cost-effective and fast testing will be available later this summer and can be used on campus this fall.</p>

	  	<p><strong>Q:</strong> How will contact tracing happen? Is there a publicly available set of guidelines for contact tracing if and when an individual tests positive?</p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> The current plan is to follow the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/php/public-health-recommendations.html">guidelines from the CDC for close contacts</a>. For COVID-19, a close contact is defined as anyone who was within 6 feet of an infected person for at least 15 minutes starting from 48 hours before the person began feeling sick until the time the patient was isolated. Right now, the general idea is that there will be two complementary approaches. One will be an app that people have on their phones. The other is to involve individuals to assist with tracing—those will most likely be people working with TCCS or possibly in Student Health Services with the addition of some students hired from CGU’s School of Community and Global Health who have been trained. There also will be individuals on each campus who have received training to assist. We will share additional information as plans solidify.</p>

	  	<p><strong>Q:</strong> What happens when a student has been diagnosed with COVID-19? What happens when a student thinks they have COVID-19? What happens if a student thinks they have been exposed to COVID-19?</p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> If a student believes they may have COVID-19 or if they are experiencing signs and symptoms, they should immediately isolate and contact Student Health Services at <a href="tel:+19096218222">909.621.8222</a> or Campus Safety after hours at <a href="tel:+19096072000">909.607.2000</a>.

<p>Isolation is used to separate people infected with the virus from people who are not infected. Students who are in isolation should remain until it’s safe for them to be around others. DSA will help coordinate isolation for the student as well as meals, coursework and other needs while in isolation. Contact tracing will be conducted to determine what other community members may have had contact with someone who has tested positive for COVID-19 and any individuals who have been identified as close contacts (defined as having close (within 6.6 ft) and prolonged (generally more than 30 minutes) contact with a person displaying symptoms of COVID-19) will be instructed to quarantine.</p>
<p>If a student believes they have been exposed to COVID-19, they should immediately begin quarantine procedures and contact Student Health Services at <a href="tel:+19096218222">909.621.8222</a> or Campus Safety after hours at <a href="tel:+19096072000">909.607.2000</a>. Quarantine is used to keep someone who might have been exposed to COVID-19 away from others to help prevent spread of disease that can occur before a person knows they are sick or if they are infected with the virus without feeling symptoms. DSA will help coordinate quarantine for the student as well as meals, coursework and other needs while in quarantine.</p>
<p>Students experiencing any of the following symptoms should contact Campus Safety at <a href="tel:+19096072000">909.607.2000</a> immediately:</p>
<ul>
<li>Difficulty breathing</li>
<li>Pressure or pain in chest</li>

<li>Confused or hard to wake</li>
<li>Other serious symptoms</li>

<p><strong>Q:</strong> What will the exact (or near exact) restrictions/availability of resources be when a student is sick?</p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> Since the vast majority of students are not covered by the Student Health Insurance Program (SHIP) they should establish a relationship with a health care provider in this area (search zip code 91711 on their provider’s website) PRIOR to arriving on campus. Making sure that the health care provider is accepting new patients. All students, whether covered by SHIP or not, have access to the Student Health Services (SHS) of The Claremont Colleges Services (TCCS). Testing of symptomatic students will be available at SHS. It is unclear at this time if an adequate number of tests will be available to proactively test all students.</p>

      <div class="card-body p-2">
	  	<p><strong>Q:</strong> Will COVID-19 testing be available on campus?</p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> We anticipate testing being available through Student Health Services for students who are experiencing symptoms of COVID-19. Faculty and staff who are experiencing symptoms should contact their health care provider to discuss whether testing is necessary. Students who are experiencing symptoms should self-isolate and not attend any in-person classes or other activities until they have been cleared to do so. Faculty and staff who are experiencing symptoms should NOT report to campus for work and should contact their direct supervisor.</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> How readily available will coronavirus tests be? Will all students, staff, and faculty be tested before the start of classes? How often will we all be tested?</p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> Right now, the advice (Read <a href="https://www.hmc.edu/coronavirus-information/wp-content/uploads/sites/61/2020/06/ACHA_COVID-19_Testing_June-3-2020.pdf">ACHA COVID-19 Testing: What We Know as of June 3, 2020 (PDF)</a> and <a href="https://www.hmc.edu/coronavirus-information/wp-content/uploads/sites/61/2020/06/LACOPH_GuidanceTestingStrategy.pdf">LAOCPH COVID-19 Testing Strategy (PDF)</a> guidance) is not to test students at the start of term and not to test until someone exhibits symptoms or has come into direct contact with someone who has tested positive. Due to shortage of testing nationally, we believe this is more of an equity issue in that if colleges and universities over-consume available tests, it leaves fewer for the people who really are more vulnerable. Our plan, assuming we are able to have students on campus and based on advice from medical experts, is doing daily symptom checks for everyone who is on campus. It is possible there will be some campuses that decide to test every student despite medical advice, but we are not planning to do that.</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> Will Student Health Services charge a fee for COVID-19 testing?</p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> Student Health Services will not charge students to test for COVID-19. However they are reserving tests for symptomatic individuals.</p>

	  	<p><strong>Q:</strong> If COVID-19 vaccine were developed, would the College require all employees to be vaccinated? Would confirmation of antibodies be accepted if an employee were to refuse the vaccine?</p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> Once a vaccine has been fully demonstrated to be safe and effective, the College would recommend employees get vaccinated unless they have medical or religious reasons not to do so. In regard to antibody tests, right now there is no scientific evidence that if you have antibodies you are immune from getting COVID-19 again. Therefore, the College can’t consider antibody test results as a substitute for any effective vaccination.</p>

	  	<p><strong>Q:</strong> How likely that the dining hall will reopen in any of these scenarios?</p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> If we have students on campus, we will have to feed them, but there will be restrictions on things like the number of students in the dining hall at a given time, limits on self-serve options, etc. We will provide more options to pick up to-go packaged meals and then take them outdoors. We would anticipate more students eating outdoors, because it’s safer. If we are in person, we will certainly have dining staff working here, but how they’re working will be different and will require changes.</p>

      <div class="card-body p-2">
	  	<p><strong>Q:</strong> What are the expectations for students to follow the health &amp; safety protocols?</p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> Students who make the choice to come back to campus this fall will be expected to follow specific COVID-19 protocols and policies for their safety and for the safety of the larger HMC community. These protocols and policies will be clearly outlined for all students prior to their return, and students will sign a document acknowledging these protocols and policies prior to being permitted to move into the residence halls or begin classes on campus.</p>
<p>The HMC Honor Code states that students are expected to act as responsible individuals, to conduct themselves with honesty and integrity both personally and academically and to respect the rights of others. The College considers these standards to be essential to our ability to physically reopen this fall. Students who violate the COVID-19 protocols and policies will be subject to a student conduct process. This will be true for HMC students who have been alleged to violate other 7C College policies, as the HMC Honor Code also expects that students will exhibit “responsible behavior both on and off campus”.</p>
<p>Students who behave in a way that presents a substantial risk of harm to self and/or others may be subject to the involuntary leave process as outlined in the <a href="http://catalog.hmc.edu/content.php?catoid=15&amp;navoid=762#leave-of-absence-withdrawal-and-readmission-policy">Leave of Absence, Withdrawal, and Readmission Policy</a>.</p>

	  	<p><strong>Q:</strong> What are the College guidelines for masks/face coverings?</p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> Essential employees who have been asked to come to campus for work, along with a small number of faculty members and others, must wear masks/face coverings when they are on campus. In addition, we have asked students to wear masks/face coverings when they come to the Dining Hall to pick up their meals. This is in keeping with recommendations from public health officials in order to protect people from the spread of COVID-19. Employees and students may wear their own masks/face coverings or if they need one, they should contact Theresa Lauer in Facilities and Maintenance.</p>
<p><strong>Q: </strong>What are the expectations about wearing a mask when you are in your office?</p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> If you work in an individual office, no more than one person should be in the same room unless the required 6 feet of distancing can be consistently maintained. If more than one person is in a room, masks/face coverings should be worn at all times. If you are the only person in your office with the door closed, you may remove your face covering. The College is investigating the possibility of providing face shields for those who need an alternative to the mask/face covering.</p>

<p><strong>A:</strong> We are committed to working with students to make sure they have the resources they need to succeed at Mudd, knowing that there are more obstacles to success now than ever. Students who are in quarantine or self-isolation due to COVID-19 illness or exposure should reach out to the Academic Deans (<a href="&#109;&#97;&#105;&#108;t&#111;:a&#99;&#97;&#100;em&#105;c&#100;&#101;an&#115;-&#108;&#64;&#103;.h&#109;&#99;.e&#100;&#117;">&#97;&#99;&#97;&#100;&#101;&#109;i&#99;d&#101;a&#110;s&#45;&#108;&#64;g.hmc.edu</a>) for support. The Academic Deans can communicate with faculty on behalf of the student and request extensions and/or excused absences. Faculty have full discretion for granting extensions and excused absences for their courses; however, faculty will provide reasonable accommodations where possible for students with documented medical issues. If a student misses an extensive amount of class due to COVID illness, they should discuss their options with one of the Academic Deans.</p>

We felt it was more efficient to have sessions with the different groups separately, so we could focus on the concerns specific to each community group. There is no reason we couldn’t have a joint session if everyone preferred that.

	  	<p><strong>Q:</strong> Does the July 10 deadline to decide if coming back to campus mean we are required to pay room even if things change before the move-in date which would cause our student to not be able to move on campus?</p>
<p><strong>A:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>All students expected to be enrolled for FA20 already have fall semester charges posted to their student account as of July 1.
<ul>
<li>If the student is on the monthly payment plan, their first installment is due by July 20</li>
<li>If the student is on the full payment plan, their payment is due by August 20.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If college housing is not an option later due to campus closure by county health or state mandate, the room and board charge would be credited at that time. Otherwise, students are still expected to pay under the normal contract dates specified above.</li>
<li>If the student opts to cancel their housing contract after July 15, they would be responsible for the $300 cancellation fee.</li>
<li>If the student is on the monthly payment plan, they are required to pay their first installment by July 20. Delinquent accounts are subject to a 1% late fee.</li>
<li>For returning students, as indicated in the housing contract, the cancellation fee is applicable if the student terminates their housing contract after participating in draw and prior to the start of the contract period.</li>
<li>Cancellation by the student after the contract period is at the discretion and approval of the student’s petition cancellation petition due to a documented personal hardship or unforeseeable extenuating circumstance.</li>
</ul>
<p>Ultimately, we want students to make their housing decision based on what they are comfortable with and what is the safest for them. We are trying to balance that with our need to know that decision far enough in advance to plan a smooth and safe move-in for those who choose that option and so that we can budget the resources necessary to make this possible.</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> My daughter has heard rumors that school might be moving students rooms who are returning to campus. She is living in a single in a suite, and is basing part of her return decision on living in that room with her current suitemates. If they decide to move students and she is not happy with her rooming situation, is she able to change her mind and stay home without financial repercussions?</p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> Cancelation should occur prior to the start of the contract period: August 22 for new students and August 23 for returning students. Also, students who cancel prior to the start of the housing contract period, there is a $300 cancellation fee.</p>

	  	<p><strong>Q:</strong> When can I move in on campus?</p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> Information about the fall move-in process is below. Also, we want to help you think about your travel plans should you decide to return. As a reminder, if you are in a position to let us know whether you 1) intend to live on campus and be available to participate in in-person classes; 2) study remotely; or 3) apply for a leave of absence/defer, by the original deadline of July 10, that will be incredibly helpful in making sure we can secure the necessary resources. If you need a little more time, we ask that you complete the <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSePsxEF044TbRF2E9YmjccIwj_uzNfhCe3k68t2y2jTEJD7JA/viewform?usp=sf_link" rel="noopener noreferrer">HMC Fall 2020 Enrollment Confirmation &amp; Housing Reservation Form</a> no later than July 15.</p>
<h4>Making Travel Arrangements</h4>
<p>We recommend that you do not purchase flights or make travel arrangements until July 20 at the earliest. We will be assessing how many students will be living on campus and assigning move-in times based on this information, which we will be unable to do before July 15.</p>
<p>When purchasing flights and making travel arrangements, we suggest that you select options that are refundable. While HMC is making preparations to re-open this fall, the LA County Department of Public Health has not yet approved the reopening of higher education institutions. California is still in the early stages of <a title="https://covid19.ca.gov/roadmap/#top" href="https://covid19.ca.gov/roadmap/#top" rel="noopener noreferrer">Phase 2 of its re-opening plan</a>, and in recent days, we have seen a concerning trend in Los Angeles County of <a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/COVID19CountyDataTable.aspx" rel="noopener noreferrer">increasing infection rates and hospitalizations</a>. We do not have an estimate of when we will hear from the LA County Department of Public Health, and it is possible that they may tell us we are not approved to re-open later in the summer after you have already made travel arrangements.</p>
<h4>Move-in Days</h4>
<p>As of now, here are anticipated move-in days:</p>
<ul>
<li>Thursday, August 20: Student Leaders (Proctors, Mentors, Head Mentors, NISSO Mentors, SI Mentors, and select members of ASHMC)</li>
<li>Friday, August 21: SI students and new international students</li>
<li>Saturday, August 22: New students</li>
<li>Sunday, August 23: Returning students</li>
</ul>
<p>All students will be permitted three (3) hours to move-in and may have one (1) person to help them move-in to their residence hall room. Any helper(s) will also be expected to follow COVID-19 policies and protocols and will need to leave campus at the end of the designated three hours.</p>
<h4>New Students</h4>
<p>Due to various program designs, all new students (including SI students and new international students) will be assigned move-in times in the order of arrival of their respective programs.</p>
<h4>Returning Students</h4>
<p>Returning students will have the opportunity to sign up for move-in time slots based on reduced capacity per building. As of now, we are anticipating four (4) time periods (7–10 a.m., 11 a.m.–2 .p.m, 3–6 p.m., and 7–10 p.m.) from which upperclass students can choose. We will be determining the number of students who are able to move-in on a per building basis, with no more than 25% capacity during each time period. Additionally, if you have a roommate, we will be asking you to move-in at different times. While we are working on the details of this process still, we anticipate that we will have slightly different protocols for suites. After we know how many students will be on campus, we will communicate more details about the move-in times and process.</p>
<h4>Special Circumstances</h4>
<p>While we are asking you to prepare for more strict arrival and move-in regulations, we will work with people who have extraordinary circumstances (such as international students with limited flight availability) regarding move-in times. Students who have extraordinary circumstances should complete this <a href="https://forms.gle/hBRcf4heXbdZmaPCA" rel="noopener noreferrer">Move-in time change request for returning students form</a> to request a new move-in time.</p>
<h4>Storage Pods</h4>
<p>More information to come! Please know that we will work with students that choose not to return to campus for the fall semester or entire academic year to continue storing their belongings for them.</p>
<p>We will continue adding questions and answers to this page that will be helpful for you.</p>
<h4>Move-in Shopping by Families</h4>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> On move in day will families be allowed to leave campus to purchase necessities for the residence hall, and deliver them to their student?</p>
<p><strong>A: </strong>Our main goal is to keep students and their families safe, so we need to limit exposure once students and families arrive to campus. With that in mind, we ask that you bring all your move-in supplies with you before getting on campus for your designated move-in time. The mail room will be open in case you forgot something and need to mail it to students. Information about room dimensions, a packing list, and other helpful information about the residence halls can be found on the <a href="https://www.hmc.edu/student-life/orientation/dorm-faqs/">Residence Hall Information</a> page on our website.</p>
<p>This year, we will be sending students a specific packing list over the summer that includes items needed for COVID-19 policies and hygiene practices, as well as some suggestions of items students may wish to bring to enjoy time outside since our physical space will look different.</p>
<h4>Move-in Quarantine</h4>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> What will the two-week quarantine look like?</p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> A full quarantine in the sense that students will be in their residence halls with very limited contact with others, food delivery, mail delivery, outside scheduled exercise, no mass gatherings of any sort.</p>
<h4>Grocery Shopping During Quarantine</h4>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> Students who stay on campus and do not have meal plans or have very reduced meal plans, how will they be accommodated as they will be making grocery runs (and so will have exposure to others)?</p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> During the two-week quarantine, students will not be able to go to the grocery store. It will be a true quarantine and we will ask students to utilize the delivery systems available to them.</p>

New students will be connected to student leaders, called Mentors, who will guide them through the online orientation program. There will be a NSO program that adheres to social distancing regulations beginning right after move-in on Saturday, August 22 and continuing through Sunday, August 23. More details will be communicated over the summer to incoming students via the Orientation Student Newsletter and the Orientation website. We hope to have a welcoming experience which can help new students get to know Mudd, while keeping everybody as safe as possible.</p>

	  	<p><strong>Q:</strong> Will Summer Institute be cancelled?</p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> Summer Institute will not be canceled. However, the format of the program will be modified and adjusted to adhere to our updated academic calendar and social distancing protocol. This year Summer Institute will begin in late July with online modules and mentor group meetings. The on-campus portion of the program will also be adjusted. As dates become available, we will notify participants via their hmc email so they may continue to plan their arrival to campus.</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> Will International Students Orientation be cancelled?</p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> New International Student and Scholar Orientation (NISSO) will not be cancelled. The Office of Institutional Diversity is working hard to provide an online orientation for students followed by a socially distant on-campus orientation on Saturday, August 22 after their move-in on Friday, August 21</p>

HMC is not responsible for supervising and caring for an assistance animal in the case that an owner is unable to do so.

	  	<p><strong>Q:</strong> Can my partner visit me in my residence hall? What about other guests and family? Will 7C students be able to come to HMC?</p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> For the fall, no guests will be permitted to visit on campus, which unfortunately includes fellow students from the other Claremont Colleges. However, an exception will be made for one person who may help students move-in during their assigned time slot in August.</p>
<p>We realize this will have serious implications on students&#8217; social lives, and are working on ways to make sure students can still be a part of an active community. For example, there will be outdoor covered common spaces that we will create as alternatives for students wishing to spend socially distanced time together to study and work collaboratively.</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> Can students visit each other in dorm rooms?</p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> We have different outdoor spaces in the residence hall communities where students can visit. We will begin by not allowing students to visit each other in rooms and will revise that as we are able to.</p>

	  	<p><strong>Q:</strong> Can I apply to live at home or off-campus while I am an enrolled student at HMC in the fall semester?</p>
<p><strong>A: </strong>Students interested in living off-campus or at home and completing their courses through the HMC Remote Learning Semester should indicate their preference on the <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1retTryB_umgw60ZfpMtXMHgfWEI9KgcPNUBWtmRKb9s/edit?ts=5efa3df5">Enrollment Verification and Housing Form</a>. These students who will be participating in Remote Learning should work with the Academic Deans (<a href="m&#97;i&#108;to:ac&#97;de&#109;&#105;cd&#101;&#97;&#110;&#115;-&#108;&#64;&#103;.&#104;&#109;&#99;&#46;&#101;du">aca&#100;emi&#99;d&#101;ans&#45;&#108;&#64;g&#46;&#104;mc&#46;edu</a>) to review their course schedule and discuss whether courses will be accessible in an online format. Students should be aware that some required courses, including labs, may have in-person components which are not able to be offered in an online format.</p>
<p>Students choosing to live away from campus and participate in Remote Learning due to underlying health conditions are encouraged to register with <a href="https://www.hmc.edu/ability">HMC’s Student Accessibility Services</a> through the AIM Portal or speak with Dean Amy Bibbens (<a href="&#109;&#97;&#105;lt&#111;:&#97;&#98;&#105;bbens&#64;g.&#104;m&#99;.&#101;&#100;u">&#97;&#98;&#105;&#98;&#98;&#101;n&#115;&#64;g.hm&#99;&#46;e&#100;u</a>).</p>
<h4>Off-campus Living and Financial Aid</h4>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> If students choose to stay off campus, will they adversely be impacted by financial aid or housing in Spring?</p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> If a student chooses to live off campus their cost of attendance will change and their need-based financial aid will be adjusted accordingly. We prefer each student to reach out to Financial Aid directly at <a href="&#109;ailto&#58;fin&#97;nc&#105;a&#108;_aid&#64;&#104;m&#99;.edu">f&#105;&#110;ancial_&#97;id&#64;&#104;mc.&#101;d&#117;</a> as every student’s financial situation is different. Housing in spring will be available to students who live at home in the fall, however we will not be able to honor your selected room draw room on campus in this circumstance.</p>

	  	<p><strong>Q:</strong> What will be the College’s response to students who violate the “visitation” rules for HMC’s campus? What about the other campuses?</p>
<p><strong>A: </strong>The College considers these standards to be essential to our ability to physically reopen this fall. The policies exist because we think it’s the only way for us to be able to open, so it’s important to make sure that they are followed.</p>
<p>If students feel like they cannot abide by the policies and protocols, they have the opportunity to make an active choice not to return this fall. Students, staff and faculty in our community all have different circumstances and backgrounds, and we hope to provide a stable, safe environment without putting people at risk.</p>
<p>If a student gets sick, the most important thing is for us to connect them with healthcare and mitigate risk to the rest of the community. Because of this, when a student tests positive for COVID-19, a member of the contact tracing committee will reach out and ask questions about individuals you may have had contact with during the incubation phase of your sickness. The contact tracing committee is not responsible for Honor Code or COVID-19 Policy enforcement, and will be focused on public health, not student conduct enforcement. This is always a public health issue first, and students will be encouraged to honestly report contact with community members, regardless of if they were following COVID-19 Policies.</p>
<p>Our expectation is that those who actively choose to return to the residential campus environment will keep each other accountable and safe. The Student Advisory Board and the DSA are still working together on determining how violations will be handled from a student conduct perspective. We respect the Honor Code at HMC and we recognize that it is important for students to be transparent about their social activities for the purposes of contact tracing. Thus, this sentiment will be taken into consideration when determining sanctions for students who come forward with an unprompted self report regarding COVID-19 policies. We will focus on working with the student first and ensuring everybody on campus is staying safe and healthy. However, in the case of repeated violations, the school will take action to make sure we can maintain the safety of the community. In extreme circumstances, students who continue to violate policies, despite warnings, may be subject to the involuntary leave of absence process as outlined in the <a href="http://catalog.hmc.edu/content.php?catoid=15&amp;navoid=762#leave-of-absence-withdrawal-and-readmission-policy">Leave of Absence, Withdrawal, and Readmission Policy</a>.</p>

	  	<p><strong>Q:</strong> Are there guidelines for distant travel which would require employees to quarantine?</p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> We realize that employees will experience family emergencies that could require them to travel outside the local community. Generally, the College will not permit College-sponsored, business-related travel, either domestically or internationally. If you voluntarily travel away from your local community (i.e., visiting a tourist destination such as a beach, amusement park, etc.) know that these activities increase your chances of getting infected and spreading COVID-19. If you develop symptoms of COVID-19, you will need to stay at home until you are no longer considered infectious. Please contact your supervisor and the Office of Human Resources for additional guidance.</p>
