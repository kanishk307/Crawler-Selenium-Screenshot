	  	<p><strong>Q:</strong> The other Claremont Colleges appear to be on a path to reopening in the fall with students on campus, but they have not prevented their students from stepping on one another&#8217;s campuses. Why is HMC different? Why are we deviating from the rest of the consortium, and are we prepared for the longer-term social and political costs of going it alone? What is the board&#8217;s rationale in instructing the college to take this stance?</p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> Given the increasing rate of infection in the county, there is no college that truly knows right now if it will actually be allowed to have students on campus this fall. While the undergraduate campuses have been able to agree to a shared academic calendar, in other areas it has been more of a challenge because we have five colleges with five boards and five sets of faculty, staff and students and everyone has a different culture and differences of opinion about how to approach the next academic year.</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> Why are we maintaining the conceit that HMC students will isolate themselves to the HMC campus only, without crossing over to the other colleges, to the Village, or anywhere else? This is a fantasy. So much planning is being done, built on a foundation of this faulty assumption. Students&#8217; courses are going to be thrown for a loop. CMS athletics are at risk of cancellation. The other colleges aren&#8217;t taking similar positions. Instead, HMC is planning for and living in a delusional state. We&#8217;re scientists &#8212; why are we embracing magical thinking?</p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> We’ve consulted students in developing the planning scenario. They believe they can make the plans work and so do we.</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> In reference to an apparent Board directive to make our campus “HMC students only” and prevent HMC students from going off-campus in the fall, Scripps Dean of Faculty recently said “The other four [colleges] are holding hands and not thinking about [such restrictions]. We are thinking about the Claremont Colleges as the Claremont Colleges.” Can you respond to this and why the Board is not aware of the Consortial nature of our residential and educational experience?</p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> The two guiding principles that have focused our planning process are protecting the health and safety of all members of the HMC community while providing the collaborative educational experiences we treasure. We believe we can best protect the HMC community when we are able to limit its size to the 1,100 faculty, staff and students physically at HMC vs. the more than 10,000 in the entire consortium. This is a different world we are in, and while we don’t like the idea of limiting access to our campus, we believe strongly that it is necessary to protect the most vulnerable members of our community. We’re in an extremely challenging situation. There are no good answers. There is no way to make things the way we’d like for them to happen.</p>

	  	<p><strong>Q:</strong> I know student extracurricular participation is an important part of the mental health of many of our students, but that many of those activities, should they come back, will be on other campuses. Are we synchronizing with other colleges at all to let our CMS athletes and musicians in the Pomona ensembles participate if these programs return?</p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> LA County Dept. of Public Health has said that they do not anticipate colleges and universities being able to offer athletics this academic year. It’s very hard to synchronize when we still have not received official guidance from the county. Each of the colleges in the consortium has been trying to adjust based on their own campus community’s needs. While we don’t have official guidance, we do expect that we likely will not be allowed to have musical groups, particularly choral and brass or woodwind instruments. In our planning, we have tried to carefully balance making difficult decisions that we know will negatively impact some of our students with the need to be thoughtful so that we can minimize the virus’s spread.</p>

<p><strong>A:</strong> The Community Emergency Aid Fund provides operational support to the College following the unforeseen expenditures related to the COVID-19 pandemic, specifically, the need to provide more than $3 million in room and board refunds to our students as well as the additional expenses necessary to transition to online learning for the remaining portion of the semester. More than $300,000 has been raised during the 2019–20 fiscal year, which helps offset these unforeseen expenses. In hindsight, we realize that there was some confusion about the purpose of this fund, and for that we apologize.</p>

	  	<p><strong>Q:</strong> Will you consider furloughs if the students are online and in person and if so, will furloughed employees be able to receive benefits?</p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> If it is possible to have most students on campus for in-person classes this fall, we will try to avoid furloughs. If we are forced to furlough employees, our hope is that we will still be able to offer medical benefits, but not other benefits. For positions that are conducive to partial furloughs, we are looking into the possibility of using a 20% (one day a week) furlough approach. There are several positions, like our dining hall workers, who would not have work to do if most of our students are not back on campus in the fall and where partial furloughs would not work. Every Cabinet member will review the needs of their departments carefully to develop customized plans to meet the needs of our community. Again, our strong preference is that we be able to have students on campus this fall and that we not be forced to furlough employees. We would only consider this option if we are not able to have the majority of our students on campus this fall.</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> If we don’t return to campus, will the people working in Dining Services be needed? Will they be laid off or furloughed?</p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> If we are not able to bring students back to campus and provide instruction online, the dining hall will not be open and it will be unfortunately necessary to temporarily furlough most of the dining staff during the period when students are not on campus.</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> If we have furloughs, will they be complete or partial?</p>
<p><strong>A: </strong>We have spent an enormous amount of energy planning to have students back on campus this fall. Given the current situation with the pandemic, we now have to pivot and begin thinking about more detailed planning for what happens if we aren’t allowed to have students on campus this fall. For positions that are conducive to partial furloughs, we are looking into the possibility of using a 20% (one day a week) furlough approach. There are several positions, like our dining hall workers and F&amp;M residential custodial workers, who would not have work to do if most of our students are not back on campus in the fall and where partial furloughs would not work. Every Cabinet member will review the needs of their departments carefully to develop customized plans to meet the needs of our community.</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> How much notice will staff receive if they are to be furloughed partially or fully?</p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> We will make every effort to give staff as much notice as possible so that you can adequately plan.</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> If furloughed, can we cash out vacation hours?</p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> Furloughed employees are allowed to be paid for accrued time.</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> If furloughed, can employees collect unemployment?</p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> Employees can apply for unemployment and decisions to award unemployment to an individual are made by the State of California Employment Development Department (EDD).</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> If staff are furloughed, would the College continue to pay benefits?</p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> If students don’t return to campus in the fall, necessitating furloughs, your health benefits (medical, dental and vision), will continue for the fall semester. However, no other benefits, such as dependent scholarship or retirement contributions, will be provided for furloughed staff.</p>

If the college determines this option is needed, we will explore options to assist our staff to minimize the impact on benefits and credit for time of employment.</p>

	  	<p><strong>Q:</strong> How can the College help employees with burnout?</p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> We are looking into the possibility of offering a number of webinars by people who work in this area, some of them, alumni. We will plan to offer these wellness webinars to faculty, staff and students.</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> What approaches can we take to address the feelings of loneliness and isolation that our students, faculty and staff may feel during the fall semester as a result of the social distancing that is required for health and safety? Working at home or in an office with the door closed can feel very disconnected from our community and colleagues, whom we miss dearly. In general, I am worried about the mental and emotional health of our faculty and staff (and students!) and I hope that the college can be resourceful and creative in how we operate within the necessary constraints that we must have in place to keep everyone physically safe and healthy.</p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> We are looking into the possibility of offering a number of webinars by people who work in this area, some of them, alumni. We will plan to offer these wellness webinars to faculty, staff and students.</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> It appears we are taking away a great deal of what contributes to our students&#8217; personal growth and academic success during their time on campus. Moreover, we are adding measures (online learning, studying in isolation, not leaving campus) that will substantially increase their stress on campus. This is particularly true for students who experience marginalization in our community (and face a disproportionate burden of illness and death from Covid-19). Beyond teaching and staying healthy, what are we doing to help our students be successful this fall, particularly with “nurturing and developing the whole person” and “unsurpassed excellence and diversity at all levels&#8221;?</p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> In spring, we did our best to pivot and do a lot of those things—we had more students take our leadership certificate that we launched in fall. We are looking to ramp up our online co-curricular offerings that look at how we build whole person. The intergroup racial dialogue will be moved to an online format. We will continue to look at ways we can support our students, including building community and offering programming and support, using online resources.</p>

	  	<p><strong>Q:</strong> Please elaborate about the “level of pay for exempt” you mentioned when discussing minimum wage increases?</p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> California is on track to raise the minimum wage in the state to $15/hour over the course of the next few years. As the minimum wage increases, in order to qualify for exempt status, an exempt employee has to earn at least two times the state’s minimum hourly wage. As the minimum wage in California increases, we are increasing the salary of some exempt employees to ensure we remain in compliance with state law. As a result, some exempt employees will qualify for pay increases next fiscal year despite the College’s anticipated salary freeze for FY 20–21.</p>

	  	<p><strong>Q:</strong> If antibody testing becomes available, will HMC purchase the kits so we can be tested and return to work?</p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> So far, the antibody tests have not proven to be reliable. Also, there is currently no medical evidence that people who have been infected and recovered are not susceptible to future infections. Because of these factors, it is more likely right now that we will focus our efforts on testing people who may be infected and doing additional contract tracing to identify individuals with whom those individuals may have come in contact.</p>
<p>While we haven’t determined all of the procedures we will need to implement to open the campus for in-person classes this fall, our Board Chair, Wayne Drinkward ’73, has suggested that we might consider asking students to self-quarantine at home for the two weeks prior to arrival on campus and to do orientation and other activities during that time. Once students arrive on campus, we might consider asking them to participate in another two weeks of online classes only, with students quarantining in the residence halls, to minimize the risk of possible spread of infection. We do plan to have masks and thermometers available. We also are hopeful that cost-effective and fast testing will be available later this summer and can be used on campus this fall.</p>

	  	<p><strong>Q:</strong> How will contact tracing happen? Is there a publicly available set of guidelines for contact tracing if and when an individual tests positive?</p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> The current plan is to follow the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/php/public-health-recommendations.html">guidelines from the CDC for close contacts</a>. For COVID-19, a close contact is defined as anyone who was within 6 feet of an infected person for at least 15 minutes starting from 48 hours before the person began feeling sick until the time the patient was isolated. Right now, the general idea is that there will be two complementary approaches. One will be an app that people have on their phones. The other is to involve individuals to assist with tracing—those will most likely be people working with TCCS or possibly in Student Health Services with the addition of some students hired from CGU’s School of Community and Global Health who have been trained. There also will be individuals on each campus who have received training to assist. We will share additional information as plans solidify.</p>

<p><strong>Q:</strong> Will the number of COVID-19 cases rising in the state mean that workers who did go back to working on campus will have to reduce their time on campus?</p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> We cannot predict the answer. Given the rapidly changing nature of the COVID-19 pandemic in California and across the nation, it is not possible to say. If the state issues another Safer at Home recommendation or if LA County Public Health officials order changes to when businesses can be open, we will comply with those orders.</p>

	  	<p><strong>Q:</strong> Will COVID-19 testing be available on campus?</p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> We anticipate testing being available through Student Health Services for students who are experiencing symptoms of COVID-19. Faculty and staff who are experiencing symptoms should contact their health care provider to discuss whether testing is necessary. Students who are experiencing symptoms should self-isolate and not attend any in-person classes or other activities until they have been cleared to do so. Faculty and staff who are experiencing symptoms should NOT report to campus for work and should contact their direct supervisor.</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> How readily available will coronavirus tests be? Will all students, staff, and faculty be tested before the start of classes? How often will we all be tested?</p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> Right now, the advice (Read <a href="https://www.hmc.edu/coronavirus-information/wp-content/uploads/sites/61/2020/06/ACHA_COVID-19_Testing_June-3-2020.pdf">ACHA COVID-19 Testing: What We Know as of June 3, 2020 (PDF)</a> and <a href="https://www.hmc.edu/coronavirus-information/wp-content/uploads/sites/61/2020/06/LACOPH_GuidanceTestingStrategy.pdf">LAOCPH COVID-19 Testing Strategy (PDF)</a> guidance) is not to test students at the start of term and not to test until someone exhibits symptoms or has come into direct contact with someone who has tested positive. Due to shortage of testing nationally, we believe this is more of an equity issue in that if colleges and universities over-consume available tests, it leaves fewer for the people who really are more vulnerable. Our plan, assuming we are able to have students on campus and based on advice from medical experts, is doing daily symptom checks for everyone who is on campus. It is possible there will be some campuses that decide to test every student despite medical advice, but we are not planning to do that.</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> Will Student Health Services charge a fee for COVID-19 testing?</p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> Student Health Services will not charge students to test for COVID-19. However they are reserving tests for symptomatic individuals.</p>

	  	<p><strong>Q:</strong> If COVID-19 vaccine were developed, would the College require all employees to be vaccinated? Would confirmation of antibodies be accepted if an employee were to refuse the vaccine?</p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> Once a vaccine has been fully demonstrated to be safe and effective, the College would recommend employees get vaccinated unless they have medical or religious reasons not to do so. In regard to antibody tests, right now there is no scientific evidence that if you have antibodies you are immune from getting COVID-19 again. Therefore, the College can’t consider antibody test results as a substitute for any effective vaccination.</p>

We would anticipate more students eating outdoors, because it’s safer. If we are in person, we will certainly have dining staff working here, but how they’re working will be different and will require changes.</p>

	  	<p><strong>Q:</strong> What are the College guidelines for masks/face coverings?</p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> Essential employees who have been asked to come to campus for work, along with a small number of faculty members and others, must wear masks/face coverings when they are on campus. In addition, we have asked students to wear masks/face coverings when they come to the Dining Hall to pick up their meals. This is in keeping with recommendations from public health officials in order to protect people from the spread of COVID-19. Employees and students may wear their own masks/face coverings or if they need one, they should contact Theresa Lauer in Facilities and Maintenance.</p>
<p><strong>Q: </strong>What are the expectations about wearing a mask when you are in your office?</p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> If you work in an individual office, no more than one person should be in the same room unless the required 6 feet of distancing can be consistently maintained. If more than one person is in a room, masks/face coverings should be worn at all times. If you are the only person in your office with the door closed, you may remove your face covering. The College is investigating the possibility of providing face shields for those who need an alternative to the mask/face covering.</p>

We felt it was more efficient to have sessions with the different groups separately, so we could focus on the concerns specific to each community group. There is no reason we couldn’t have a joint session if everyone preferred that.

Generally, the College will not permit College-sponsored, business-related travel, either domestically or internationally. If you voluntarily travel away from your local community (i.e., visiting a tourist destination such as a beach, amusement park, etc.) know that these activities increase your chances of getting infected and spreading COVID-19. If you develop symptoms of COVID-19, you will need to stay at home until you are no longer considered infectious.
