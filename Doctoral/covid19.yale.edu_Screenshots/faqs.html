    <div class="content clearfix">
      <p>In each semester of the academic year, three classes of Yale College (undergraduate) students will be living on campus or off campus in New Haven, and one class will be studying remotely from home. All graduate and professional students may return to campus for the entire academic year. All students will be asked to sign a <a href="https://registrar.yale.edu/compact">community compact</a> as a condition for returning to campus.</p>

              <h2 class="block-title">When may students return to campus?</h2>
        
    <div class="content clearfix">
      <p>Undergraduates in the first-year class, and juniors and seniors, may return to campus in late August — a detailed schedule will be provided by Yale College.</p>
<p>First-year students will be admitted to their rooms on campus the week of August 24. They will receive a message about how to schedule their move-in. They may not study on campus during the spring semester of 2021, but are encouraged to enroll remotely.</p>
<p>Sophomores may return to campus in the spring semester (most likely beginning January 2021). They may not study on campus in the fall semester of 2020, but are encouraged to enroll remotely.</p>
<p>Juniors and seniors may remain in residence throughout the academic year, except for a quiet period from November 21, 2020, to January 2021, when students are expected to return home if possible. Those living on campus may move in during the week of August 24. Those living off campus may choose to return in the second half of August if they notify their residential college deans.</p>
<p>Graduate and professional students may return at any time prior to the start of the fall term. Most graduate and professional students live off campus; housing for those living on campus opens Aug. 1.</p>

    <div class="content clearfix">
      <p>Students may elect to study from home. They will be charged full tuition but will not be charged room and board, and will receive financial aid based on the cost of attendance for remote learners. Those studying from home may continue to work remotely on research projects and other activities. In order to reduce travel and density on campus, they will not be permitted entry to campus buildings.</p>

    <div class="content clearfix">
      <p><strong>For undergraduates</strong><br />
Sophomores, juniors, and seniors may declare a leave of absence for one or two terms, just as they would in any other semester. Leaves in 2020-2021 will not count toward the usual two-term limit on leaves. The last day to request a leave is September 14, 2020.</p>
<p>First-year students may take a leave of absence for the spring semester or may <a href="https://apps.admissions.yale.edu/apply/status">request to postpone their matriculation</a> until fall 2021 (i.e., take a gap year). First-year students wishing to take a gap year before enrolling should submit a <a href="https://apps.admissions.yale.edu/apply/status">request to the Office of Undergraduate Admissions by July 15</a>.</p>
<p>We recommend that you explore all your options before deciding to take a leave or postpone your matriculation. Students on leave or a gap year will not be permitted to take a campus job, even remotely.</p>
<p><strong>For graduate and professional students</strong><br />
Leave of absence and deferral policies vary from school to school within Yale. Please contact your school for relevant guidance.</p>

      <p>We are working hard to assist international students in getting their visas, but we recognize that many international students may be unable to return to campus in time for the August start dates of most schools. Most schools will have online options for those unable to attend the first month of classes. Some programs will be available online for the whole semester.

    <div class="content clearfix">
      <p>The university must follow guidance from the State of Connecticut; to the degree that the state’s guidance changes, Yale may be required to change its own plans. See <a href="https://nam05.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fportal.ct.gov%2Fcoronavirus&amp;data=02%7C01%7Ceric.gershon%40yale.edu%7C5dd9327db44a435dc30e08d81c6bb510%7Cdd8cbebb21394df8b4114e3e87abeb5c%7C0%7C0%7C637290596216952903&amp;sdata=k4DvNQrMKZG97Jny9XNfvg%2BnOGYzzc2yP2Ocm40tgaI%3D&amp;reserved=0" target="_blank">https://portal.ct.gov/coronavirus</a>.</p>
<p>If the public health situation worsens considerably in the next few weeks, the return to campus may be delayed. In that case, all courses — undergraduate, graduate, and professional — will be conducted exclusively through online delivery until the public health situation improves. </p>
<p>If the public health situation in Connecticut, in New Haven, or on campus worsens considerably during the fall semester, students should be prepared to follow the university’s and public health authorities’ instructions, which may include “staying-in-place” in their place of residence, whether residential colleges, other on-campus residences, or off-campus apartments. For those with meal plans, the university will continue to provide meals during a stay-in-place period. Classes would be held exclusively online.</p>

      <p>Most Yale College courses will be offered online, featuring live Zoom seminars and a mix of live and recorded lectures. The faculty and staff are working hard to provide the best possible courses online, incorporating feedback from last semester’s and this summer’s online courses.</p>
<p>Some discussion sections, lab courses, studio courses, and collections-based courses will be offered in person, with smaller enrollments to allow for physical distancing and observance of all other precautions under public health guidance in force at the time programs start.</p>
<p>Where possible, there may be some associated in-person component for courses that take place in an otherwise online fashion.</p>
<p>Decisions on teaching in the graduate and professional schools will be made by individual departments and schools. Most programs will be offered by dual delivery, with a mixture of remote and in-person experiences. Each school has a specific return-to-campus plan; details are being provided by each school’s dean.</p>

    <div class="content clearfix">
      <p>Yale began reactivating on-campus research on June 1. Following guidelines from the State of Connecticut and the expert advice of Yale faculty in medicine, nursing, and public health, the university has developed phased <em>Returning to Yale</em> plans that include testing, contact tracing, isolation and quarantine, daily health checks, social distancing, and mask-wearing. We are also reducing housing density in Yale College and dormitory-style graduate residences. The university is following a careful, phased approach to resuming operations on campus, taking into consideration public health guidance, the needs of vulnerable populations, and the mission of the university.</p>
<p>Faculty at Yale and at Yale New Haven Hospital have been active in treating COVID-19 and researching the biology and transmission of the underlying coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2. Although Connecticut was originally one of the hardest-hit states, the rate of transmission (R<sub>t</sub>) in the state as of July 1 is below 1, and as a result the number of new cases has fallen.</p>

      <p>Yes. A member of the Yale community who has a concern about compliance with COVID-19 health and safety policies or regulations may raise that concern in one of two ways. First, a community member who feels comfortable doing so may report a concern to their supervisor, their human resources representative, or a supervising faculty member. Second, a community member may make an anonymous or identified report through the <a href="https://your.yale.edu/work-yale/financials/auditing/yale-university-hotline">University Hotline</a>. The hotline is available 24 hours a day, seven days a week.</p>
<p>University policy prohibits retaliation against community members who in good faith report possible violations of Yale policy, including possible violations of health and safety standards related to COVID-19.</p>
