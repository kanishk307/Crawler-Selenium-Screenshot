      <p>OCU Facilities Management ensures university ventilation systems are operating properly and have increased the circulation of outside air as appropriate for each building system. All building water systems have been flushed and are safe for occupancy.</p>
<p>Physical barriers and guides are in place such as sneeze guards and partitions where it is difficult to social distance.</p>
<p>Directional signs and markers on floors have been installed to aid in social distancing efforts as people move around campus.</p>
<p> Campus community members are encouraged to use stairs when feasible to limit elevator usage. Elevator capacity is limited to three people who must wear masks and face away from each other while in the elevator. Hand sanitizer stations are located in or near all campus elevators.</p>
<h2>Phased Return to Work and other work-related measures</h2>
<p>OCU has implemented a phased return to work plan that began June 15 and phases back employees based on the nature of their position in two-week increments . OCU continues to support remote work for some positions. </p>
<p>All employees must review OCU COVID-19 policies and procedures, complete a self-assessment and training prior to returning to campus from remote work. </p>
<p>The university is offering options to employees who are at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19 such as remote work, modified job duties, etc. Some departments implemented staggered or alternating schedules to promote social distancing. At-risk employees are encouraged to register confidentially with the Campus Clinic to aid in safety planning. </p>
<p>Non-essential domestic and international travel is suspended indefinitely. Essential travel is reviewed on a case by case basis by the policy group.</p>

<p>Move-in will be extended and students will have the option to drop off their items the week before move-in. The density of students will be lower due to time slot signups and there will be a limit on the number of people who can assist students. Staff will check-in students at their cars in line. Resident Assistants will also be on the floors making sure spaces are open for those students. All paperwork, keys, and items will be placed in the students’ rooms ahead of time.</p>

    <h2 data-control>Dance and Entertainment</h2>
    <div class="text_content" data-content>
        <h3>General Overview for Dance and Entertainment
</h3>
<p>We are committed to the health, safety, and welfare of our students, faculty, and staff. Responsible responses to the challenges COVID-19 presents require constant monitoring of an ever-changing situation and informed measures to mitigate the level of hazard presented by the pandemic for specific situations.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>By now, everyone in the United States has heard about the importance of social distancing as one component in mitigating the COVID-19 pandemic. While the public has been advised to keep six feet of distance from others to maintain social distancing, the six feet figure is based on non-moving people in still air. Once people begin to move relative to each other, the safe social distance becomes immediately greater. In a dance studio, two slow moving dancers would need to maintain a safe distance of over 16 feet, and two fast moving dancers would need to stay at over 33 feet apart. These distances, related to the speed of movement, can be thought of as dance social distancing, as opposed to standard (6 ft.) social distancing. Each dancer also creates substantial disruption of the air around themselves. The faster the movement, the greater the air dispersion, and the greater the dance social distancing needed to preserve health and safety. 
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>What this means for people in the entertainment industry, where in normal times many people work close together collaboratively and interdependently for prolonged periods of time, the needed social distancing safety margins are much greater. And, for dancers, nearly impossible. As long as social distancing is necessary, there can be no normalcy in dance.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<h4>How Will the Ann Lacy School Conduct Dance Classes?
</h4>
<p>It is necessary for us to limit movement in order to maintain achievable social distancing in the dance studios. Each studio will have squares marked with tape on the dance floor. Each square will be six feet by six feet in size. The squares will be more than six feet apart. Each student will be assigned a square and, for ballet, a barre. The dancer will need to work within their square. Faculty members will design their classes to make this possible.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Students enrolled in classes will be divided into two groups. The groups will rotate between taking class in the studio and taking class online. For example, enrollment in classes held in our largest studios will be capped at 22 students. The 22 students will be divided into two groups of 11. On a given class period, one group of 11 students will take class in the studio, one to each of 11 squares. At the same time, the other group of 11 students will take the same class online. The next time the class meets, the two groups will switch, with the students who last took the class online taking the class in the studio, and vice versa. When students are having their “studio time,” they will receive corrections and may ask questions they may have.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Next to each square, there will be a chair for the student using the square to store personal belongings, since we cannot maintain social distancing in the locker rooms.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Each dance major and non-majors enrolled in a tap class will have a personal portable dance floor checked out to them for use during online instruction, at no additional charge.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Smaller dance studios will have appropriate numbers of 6x6 squares to maintain necessary social distancing.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Masks must be worn at all times in the Ann Lacy building, including in dance class. Mouth and nose must be covered.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<h4>Will There Be Performances?
</h4>
<p>As long as social distancing is medically necessary, it will not be possible to safely have rehearsals and performances. Ordinarily, The American Spirit Dance Company consists of approximately 140 dancers. In addition to the dancers, there are 80 other students working on the management tasks required for producing our shows. The work they must do also is incompatible with dance social distancing requirements. 
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>From the information we have now on the probable impact of COVID-19 and the need to maintain social distancing, and the greater social distancing required for dance, we will not be able to produce the <em>Student Choreography Showcase and Friends</em> or <em>Home for the Holidays: A Gift of American Dance. </em>We will not be able to have rehearsals and performances of <em>Spirit of Grace Liturgical Dancers</em> or the <em>Pep Dancers</em>.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>We will reserve time in the Kirkpatrick Auditorium for several times in the fall semester in case circumstances permit some appropriate form of dance demonstration observing dance social distancing. Such events would be open only to Ann Lacy School faculty, staff, and students to allow standard social distancing in the orchestra-level seating.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The choreography faculty has been working on modifying teaching methods and assignments for both the choreography production course and the choreography performance course, creating virtual content, where personal physical contact among students is not possible.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<h4>How Will the 4-6 pm Monday-Thursday and 3-6 pm Friday Times Normally Reserved for American Spirit Dance Company, and Evenings Normally Filled with Student Choreography Show Rehearsals Be Used?
</h4>
<p>The Ann Lacy School faculty and staff are working to provide special enrichment and professional learning experiences during these time periods. An example of such an experience might be a online panel of alumni with Broadway show credits to talk about how they built their careers to lead to being a Broadway performer. Another example, for students interested in the management side of entertainment, might be a panel of alumni who have achieved success in careers such as stage management, dance company management, non-profit management, etc. Another example might be an overview of computerized theatrical lighting and moving light design concepts for dance productions by our American Spirit company manager and moving light designer.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>We have many resources available from our faculty, staff, alumni, and professional contacts to develop a unique set of experiences for our students.
</p>
<h4>Will the Community Dance Academy (formerly Community Dance Center) Be Open?
</h4>
<p>Yes, but in a virtual format. The Community Dance Academy, which is a key outreach program of the Ann Lacy School and a living teaching lab for our dance teacher students, will be physically closed as long as social distancing is medically required. However, there will be virtual classes tailored to the current circumstances. Dance pedagogy faculty will develop a variety of methods to help our dance teacher students continue preparation for their teaching careers.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<h4>What About Spring?
</h4>
<p>Decisions about what in terms of rehearsal and performance is possible in the spring will be made later, based on the best information available to us at the time we must make the decisions.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<h4>How Will the Ann Lacy School Building Operate?
</h4>
<p>While in the building, everyone is expected to observe standard social distancing at all times, and everyone must wear a mask covering nose and mouth.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>There will be specific traffic patterns established for moving in/out and around our building. <em>There will be signs everywhere!</em>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Classrooms and meeting rooms will be marked with reduced occupancy capacities. Chairs and desks will be reduced to match the reduced capacities. There will be a specific door for entering a room, and a specific door for exiting the same room. 
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>There will be designated doors for entering the building, and others for leaving, to maintain standard social distancing.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The east stairs will be for going up, and the west stairs will be for going down. People are expected to use the correct stairs for the direction they are going.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Foot traffic around the atrium, on all floors, will be northside for going west, and southside for going east. 
</p>
<p>
</p>
<h4>How Will Academic Courses Be Conducted?
</h4>
<p>Enrollment in academic courses have been capped to fit the reduced room capacity to maintain standard social distancing. Specific doors are designated for entering and exiting each classroom.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Hand sanitizer and disinfectant will be provided -- students will clean their own space at the beginning and end of each class. Large trash receptacles will be near each exit door for students to dispose of disinfectant wipes.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Each classroom will have a dedicated Zoom system, allowing students who may not be able to attend class in person to attend the class online.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<h4>What If a Student Doesn’t Comply With COVID-19 Mitigation Protocols?
</h4>
<p>Students who refuse to comply with our COVID-19 mitigation protocols may lose their privilege of being a student in the Ann Lacy School, or to attend classes and events held in the Ann Lacy School building. They will also be referred to the Dean of Students for appropriate action. It is our view that each of us has a community responsibility to be concerned about the health, safety and welfare of other members of our community and to act accordingly. 
</p>
<p>
</p>
<h4>How Do I Participate in a Class Held on Zoom?
</h4>
<p>Each student <em>must</em> have Zoom loaded on at least one personal electronic device such as a smartphone, tablet, laptop, or desktop computer. The Zoom app for smartphones and tablets is available free from the Apple Store, and for Android devices, from the Google Play Store. For a free download for a laptop or desktop computer, go to <a href="https://zoom.us/">https://zoom.us/</a> .
</p>
<p>
</p>
<h4>What Kind of Electronic Device Do You Recommend for Online Instruction?
</h4>
<p>We recommend a relatively new Apple or PC laptop computer with full wifi and Bluetooth wireless capabilities. We do not recommend Chromebooks due to compatibility/camera issues that have frustrated students. If you already own a Chromebook, download Zoom and test the system to see if it works with the version and computer configuration you have. If you have problems, you may find a workaround on the Internet. While smartphones and tablets may work, the small image sizes during class/instructional usage can become very difficult and frustrating. For one-on-one meetings, they work satisfactorily.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<h4>Why Do I Need an Electronic Device That Can Run Zoom?
</h4>
<p>Because social distancing is necessary, it is necessary that we provide hybrid-instruction, where part of a course is available online and part in the studio or classroom. Also, there are health and safety requirements limiting faculty and staff contact with students in certain situations. One, for example, is “No visitors in [most] offices.” With Zoom, you will be able to have relatively easy access to meeting with faculty and staff members with whom you need to speak. A side benefit is that you can also meet on screen with family at home and friends across the world!
</p>
<p>
</p>
<h4>What Else Do I Need?
</h4>
<p>Please bring your own fever thermometer so that you can take your temperature daily before coming to class, or if you do not feel well. If you are running a fever, we do not want you to come to class. An inexpensive digital fever thermometer from Walmart, Walgreens, or CVS will be sufficient.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<h4><strong>Attendance During COVID Conditions</strong>
</h4>
<p>Due to the professional nature of the entertainment industry, the Ann Lacy School has very tight attendance policies which mirror expectations in the entertainment industry<em>.</em> Due to COVID-19 students must take their health and the health of others into consideration, so communication is the key. Faculty will work with students if attendance flexibility is needed. If students are sick or experiencing symptoms of COVID-19, they are expected to stay home (off-campus or in assigned campus housing). Instructors will provide a virtual attendance option (whether synchronous or asynchronous), or modified coursework for students who cannot attend class in-person due to illness or presence COVID-19 symptoms. Instructors will provide reasonable flexibility in attendance requirements for students who are sick, are experiencing COVID-19 symptoms, or are under a self-isolation order. Additional information will be provided as the semester begins and students receive their course descriptions. 
</p>
<p>
</p>
<h4><strong>
What Happens If COVID-19 Gets Worse and In-Person Instruction Is No Longer Possible?</strong>
</h4>
<p>The Ann Lacy School faculty is prepared to switch to online instruction if such a situation arises. In the event everyone is required to shelter in place, or if everyone must leave the campus, we are able to continue teaching you and move you toward graduation.

        <p>Prioritization is focused on the safe delivery of in-person instruction for courses with academic outcomes that cannot be measured or achieved virtually and in compliance with accreditation guidelines. Additionally, a hybrid mode of instruction will be implemented for the foreseeable future.
</p>
<p>Faculty are planning for remote options that will be made available in the event that a rebound in local transmission of the virus necessitates continued physical distancing and to support students, faculty, and staff who are at high risk of severe illness due to COVID-19 and/or are in self- isolation, and those who cannot physically return to campus.
</p>
<p>Limits have been established for the number of attendees for in-person courses/sections in compliance with university and accreditation guidelines.
</p>
<p>To the extent possible, all in-person courses/sections should be limited in number of students based on spacing requirements and in accordance with university and accreditation guidelines. In the event larger spaces are necessary, McLaughlin Hall could be utilized. Faculty should consider alternative methods for larger courses/sections (i.e. courses taught on Monday and Wednesday or Tuesday and Thursday), when student class sizes could be split to accommodate half on one day the other half on the next class day.

        <p>CTS staff are currently in discussions with some of the schools regarding outfitting their classrooms with technology to both support in-room teaching as well as the possibility of allowing remote students or faculty the ability to participate in a class virtually. Currently, both the Business School and the Nursing School are seeking ways to incorporate remote instruction as needed with their traditional classes. Campus Tech is evaluating both short and long-term solutions for this.</p>
<p>In concert with the leadership of each school as well as through any guidelines developed by the EOC, Campus Tech will assist in preparing the classroom spaces so that faculty and students can maintain proper spacing. Technology will be relocated as needed.</p>
<p>Campus Tech is considering expanding the university’s Zoom licensing for the fall. The goal is to have enough “pro” licensing in the fall to cover all faculty requiring Zoom in their classes as well as key staff members who will need the expanded functionality of a “pro” account to conduct their services remotely.
</p>
<p>Campus Tech expects a reduction of computers in labs throughout campus to ensure social distancing standards. Staff is evaluating each lab to determine options. They will be conducting an analysis on each teaching lab to determine its historical enrollment trends in an effort to identify how many computers must remain to effectively teach in these spaces.</p>
<p>Campus Tech is evaluating and will be proposing proper sanitation measures that can be used on computing devices throughout campus to ensure they can be properly cleaned while not harming them with cleaning solutions.</p>
