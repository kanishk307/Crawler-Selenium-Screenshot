                  <h2>ETSU response to COVID-19 outbreak</h2>
                  <h3>Fall Updates - 6/19/20</h3>
                  
                  <p>Dear ETSU Community,</p>
                  
                  <p>The summer is always an exciting time and a busy season as we welcome new Buccaneers
                     to orientation and assist students in preparations for the fall semester. Our plans
                     for the fall semester include on-ground experiences for students, housing and dining
                     options, student activities, and engagement opportunities. As our offices begin to
                     physically reopen, we will be practicing social distancing, wearing masks, and following
                     other <a href="http://www.etsu.edu/bucs-are-back">COVID-19/Bucs are Back plans</a>. Staff will continue to be available via phone, email, and Zoom.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>I wanted to take this opportunity to provide an update from the Student Life and Enrollment
                     team that provides more information on services available to students and also addresses
                     questions about the fall. Contact information about each announcement is available.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>Should you need additional help or assistance, beyond some of the specific areas noted
                     below, feel free to contact the Dean of Students office for assistance and/or referral
                     at <a href="mailto:deanofstudents@etsu.edu?subject=">deanofstudents@etsu.edu</a> or <a href="tel: 423-423-4210">423-423-4210</a>.
                  </p>

                  <h3>Academic Calendar Changes for Fall 2020 - 6/18/20</h3>
                  
                  <p>Dear ETSU community,</p>
                  
                  <p>In just over two months, the campus of East Tennessee State University will experience
                     a renewed sense of excitement as we welcome students and faculty back to our campus
                     for the start of the fall 2020 semester. As I have shared with you on many occasions,
                     the start of the academic year is a time that I cherish as we celebrate the new journeys
                     that are ahead, the individuals and experiences that will define those journeys, and
                     the dreams that are made possible every day through the power of higher education.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>As we prepare for the fall 2020 semester and all the rewards it promises to bring,
                     we also recognize that the COVID-19 pandemic will require the institution to make
                     some adjustments to our procedures and operations, such as the academic calendar.
                     These changes are being made to safeguard the health of our students, faculty, staff,
                     and campus visitors as we continue our mission to improve the quality of life of the
                     people of this region through our work in teaching, research, and public service.
                  </p>

                  <h3>Return to Campus Information and Strategic Options Workgroup Update - 6/10/20</h3>
                  
                  <p>Dear ETSU Community,</p>
                  
                  <p>I would like to thank everyone who was able to join me yesterday for our Live Town
                     Hall discussion of the Future Operations Workgroup Report. I appreciate the thoughtful
                     and engaging questions received during the Town Hall and look forward to holding similar
                     events and opportunities to receive feedback from the campus in the upcoming weeks.<br> <br>As a follow-up, I want to highlight three important dates as they relate to our return
                     to campus:
                  </p>
                  
                  <ul>
                     
                     <li>Our campus will <strong>re-open to the public on July 1.</strong></li>
                     
                     <li>In order to prepare for this opening, <strong>most of you will transition from remote status to an on campus working status beginning
                           June 15.</strong>
                        
                        <ul>
                           
                           <li>Some employees may return on a rotational schedule to maintain physical distancing
                              expectations. Flexibility will be provided to employees who may need to continue working
                              remotely (e.g., individuals who identify themselves or immediate family members to
                              be at high risk as defined by the CDC).
                           </li>
                           
                           <li>Unit/Division leaders are responsible for making appropriate decisions regarding flexibility
                              for their employees. Supervisors should work with employees to explore all appropriate
                              options as we strive to meet the diverse needs of the campus community. The expectation
                              is that there will be a physical presence in each office during normal office hours
                              beginning July 1.
                           </li>
                           
                           <li>If you are unsure of when you should return to work or if you will require an accommodation,
                              please reach out to your supervisor as soon as possible.
                           </li>
                           
                        </ul>
                        
                     </li>
                     
                     <li><strong>The fall semester will begin as planned on August 24.</strong>
                        
                        <ul>
                           
                           <li>As outlined in the Future Operations Workgroup recommendations, we will transition
                              to Stage 3 with face-to-face instruction offered whenever possible, students living
                              in residence halls, and employees working on campus with options in place for staffing
                              rotations and/or remote work options to maintain physical distancing expectations.
                              More information about the Fall 2020 semester will be shared with the campus in the
                              coming weeks.
                           </li>
                           
                        </ul>
                        
                     </li>
                     
                  </ul>
                  
                  <p>Additionally, as stated in my Town Hall, I want to provide you with an update regarding
                     the progress of the Strategic Options Workgroup, which has been charged to develop
                     a set of principles and strategies that will guide the institution in addressing the
                     current budget landscape. Presently, ETSU leaders have begun to identify nearly $12.8
                     million in required budget reductions for the 2020-21 academic year beginning on July
                     1. These reductions are needed as a result of an expected decrease in state appropriations,
                     as well as a projected enrollment decline for the fall semester. Effective immediately,
                     the following measures are in place:
                  </p>
                  
                  <ul>
                     
                     <li><strong>New or replacement full-time hiring is suspended.</strong> Given that state funded hiring is effectively frozen unless necessary for accreditation
                        requirements and/or essential for program delivery. All essential hires will require
                        review of justifications and approval from the appropriate Vice President, which includes
                        requests to advertise as well as requests to hire.
                     </li>
                     
                     <li><strong>Adjunct and temporary faculty/staff hiring is highly restricted for 2020-21.</strong> If units need to request critical exceptions based on accreditation or essential
                        personnel for program delivery, those justifications must be submitted and approved
                        by the appropriate Vice President in advance of processing hiring documents.
                     </li>
                     
                     <li><strong>Travel is suspended.</strong> College deans will continue to approve travel requests within their respective colleges,
                        but any travel approved must have justification that it supports accreditation, tenure
                        activities, or essential program delivery. Dean or Vice President approval is required.
                     </li>
                     
                     <li><strong>New stipend requests are suspended.</strong> Any exceptions must have justification and approval from the Dean, the Provost, and
                        the President. Generally, assuming additional duties without a change in role complexity
                        will not be approved as an exception.
                     </li>
                     
                     <li><strong>Renovation projects/furniture purchases for new locally-funded projects are suspended.</strong> Any exemptions must be approved by the appropriate Vice President.
                     </li>
                     
                     <li><strong>New contracts and consulting agreements will be curtailed.</strong> Multi-year contracts will be reviewed and approved at the Vice President level.<br>The work of the Strategic Options Workgroup will continue, and I will share additional
                        information as it is presented.
                     </li>
                     
                  </ul>
                  
                  <p>I recognize that these are uncertain times for higher education on a national, state,
                     and local level. The measures outlined above are being taken to help ensure that East
                     Tennessee State University can continue to achieve its mission to improve the quality
                     of life for the people of this region through teaching, research, and service. Together,
                     this campus has moved through challenging times throughout our history, and I know
                     that together we will succeed through the uncertainties we are facing today.
                  </p>

                  <h3>Future Operations Workgroup Releases Recommendations for Returning to Campus - 6/3/20</h3>
                  
                  <p>Earlier this week, senior leadership had an opportunity to review and discuss the
                     recommendations from the Future Operations Workgroup that has been meeting in recent
                     weeks to articulate a plan for university services to return to campus.&nbsp; Dr. David
                     Linville and his team have done an outstanding and masterful job developing strategies
                     that ensure a safe return for our students, faculty and staff to our campus while
                     continuing our work within our teaching, research and service missions.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>These recommendations were presented to senior leadership and reviewed by our academic
                     deans yesterday, and members of the University Council will have the opportunity for
                     discussion on this topic next week.&nbsp; In addition, President Brian Noland will hold
                     a&nbsp;Town Hall via Zoom&nbsp;on Tuesday, June 9 at 11 a.m. to answer questions about this
                     plan.&nbsp; The feedback from all of these listening sessions will help guide our implementation
                     strategies.&nbsp;&nbsp;If you have questions about the workgroup recommendations to be addressed
                     at the Town Hall, please submit prior to the event&nbsp;at&nbsp;<a href="mailto:president@etsu.edu?subject=">president@etsu.edu</a>. There will also be an opportunity to ask questions during the Town Hall.&nbsp;
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>The workgroup was charged with creating a framework that could be easily adapted to
                     meeting the needs of the ever-changing COVID-19 environment.&nbsp; In reviewing the plan,
                     you will note that the return to campus is described as occurring within various stages.&nbsp;
                     Since March, the institution has operated within Stage 1 whereas all teaching is being
                     offered online and the majority of staff are working in remote locations.&nbsp; In recent
                     days we began entering into Stage 2.&nbsp; This process will take place throughout the
                     month of June. &nbsp;
                  </p>
                  
                  <h4 style="text-align: center;"><a href="/coronavirus/documents/etsu-future-operations-workgroup-recommendations.pdf">Report: Future Operations Workgroup Recommendations</a></h4>
                  
                  <p>These&nbsp;are the major highlights of&nbsp;Stage 2&nbsp;as they relate to members of the university
                     community:
                  </p>
                  
                  <p style="padding-left: 30px;">• During the remaining weeks of June, ETSU employees will start the process of transitioning
                     back to campus.&nbsp; A soft opening will begin on June 15 at which time some employees
                     will return to their offices working on rotational schedules while others continue
                     to serve remotely.&nbsp; This period of transition will be in preparation to welcome the
                     public back to ETSU by July 1.&nbsp; Information from department and/or division leadership
                     regarding this process of returning to campus will be provided to employees soon.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p style="padding-left: 30px;">• All summer courses will be taught online as planned; however, some experiential
                     learning opportunities may be offered in-person on a case-by-case basis.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p style="padding-left: 30px;">• We plan on transitioning into Stage 3 at the beginning of the fall semester when
                     ETSU fully plans to offer face-to-face instruction whenever possible and to have students
                     living within our residence halls and observing appropriate safety precautions that
                     will be outlined in our Residence Life Operations Plan.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p style="padding-left: 30px;">• The recommendations also outline decisions that will need to be made regarding calendars
                     and other events during the fall semester.&nbsp; ETSU will continue to follow recommendations
                     from the CDC, the State of Tennessee and other entities in making those decisions.&nbsp;
                     Some decisions will be subject to approval from our Board of Trustees.&nbsp; We will keep
                     you informed of these changes as the summer and fall continue.
                  </p>

                  <h3>Research Activities to Resume June 1 - 5/26/20</h3>
                  
                  <p>Effective June 1, research activities will resume on the ETSU campus. This announcement
                     applies specifically to our funded researchers and graduate students in those labs.
                     In addition, undergraduate students who are supported by NIH R15 grants or NSF grants
                     should also return to their respective labs at this time. Deans and department chairs
                     are communicating with research faculty and students regarding the conditions of re-engagement
                     of research activities in laboratories. These conditions include the use of masks,
                     limitations on the number of persons working in a lab space, and social distancing
                     practices. In addition, information is being shared with faculty and students regarding
                     the re-engagement of research activities that involve human subjects. Dr. Bill Duncan,
                     Vice Provost for Research and Sponsored Programs Administration, is overseeing the
                     process of research activities returning to campus and is making this information
                     available on the <a href="/research/orspa/federal_agency_guidance_in_response_to_covid-19.php">ORSPA website</a>. Those with questions should consult Dr. Duncan or the respective dean or department
                     chair.

                  <p>As the Future Operations Workgroup chaired by Dr. David Linville continues its efforts
                     to develop a plan to transition university operations from its current remote status
                     back to campus, a Strategic Options Workgroup has also has been established to specifically
                     address budget matters.&nbsp; Led by co-chairs Jeremy Ross and Dr. Michael Hoff, this group
                     is charged with providing the Office of the President with projected budget scenarios
                     for the 20-21 fiscal year and to make actionable recommendations and options in response
                     to each identified scenario to ensure budget and strategic plan alignment.&nbsp; In addition,
                     this group will be responsible for identifying long-term strategies that may be considered
                     for implementation into future university operations.

                  <h3>ETSU Future Operations Workgroup seeking ideas and feedback - 5/11/20</h3>
                  
                  <p>The Future Operations Workgroup is meeting to develop recommendations and a plan for
                     returning to appropriate academic, campus, and business operations in the safest way
                     possible. The workgroup intends to provide different options or scenarios for the
                     university, providing flexibility in how best to adapt to the pandemic situation as
                     it continues to evolve. This coming fall will not look like any other we have had,
                     and the workgroup wants to ensure scenarios and recommendations take into account
                     many different perspectives. As this work continues, the workgroup is providing a
                     way to submit any ideas, suggestions, or feedback. <em><strong>Comment period has ended.</strong></em></p>

                  <h3>CARES Act Information for Students - 5/8/20</h3>
                  
                  <p>East Tennessee State University&nbsp;has begun to distribute $5.54&nbsp;million&nbsp;provided by
                     the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security (CARES) Act&nbsp;for emergency relief
                     to eligible students. The U.S. Department of Education provided&nbsp;student eligibility
                     criteria and guidance to&nbsp;institutions of higher education concerning the distribution
                     of&nbsp;the federal CARES Act funds. Students are required to have established eligibility
                     for Title IV funding to qualify and the funding formula sets aside at least 75% of
                     the funds for students with federal Pell Grant eligibility.&nbsp;Grants will be distributed&nbsp;to
                     students with&nbsp;the&nbsp;highest need based on the data&nbsp;provided on their&nbsp;Free Application
                     for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) for the 2019-2020 aid year.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>In the coming days, university staff in the Office of Financial Aid and the Bursar’s
                     Office will process the&nbsp;grant amounts and apply the&nbsp;aid&nbsp;to student accounts.&nbsp; Students
                     do not need to take any action to receive the grant.&nbsp;Students eligible to receive
                     the grant will receive an&nbsp;email from the university&nbsp;with additional details regarding
                     the disbursement.&nbsp;Approximately 90% of the initial CARES Act funding will be disbursed
                     directly to eligible students in the form of grant awards to address financial hardships
                     as a result of COVID-19.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>The remaining 10% of the initial CARES Act funding will be made available for direct
                     student emergency grant requests. Students must have&nbsp;been&nbsp;enrolled&nbsp;in the spring 2020
                     semester&nbsp;to qualify and the individual grants can be awarded&nbsp;for student expenses
                     related to the disruption of campus operations due to COVID-19.&nbsp;&nbsp;More information
                     about student eligibility and how to apply for emergency grants available through
                     the CARES Act will be forthcoming in the coming days.&nbsp;&nbsp;
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>The university has already distributed almost $50,000 and raised over&nbsp;$40,000&nbsp;in private
                     donations for the&nbsp;Buccaneer Student Crisis Fund, which is a separate fund from CARES
                     Act funding. The <a href="/students/student-crisis-fund.php">Buccaneer Crisis funds</a> enable the university to support a broader range of students&nbsp;and student needs, which
                     include international students and other students who may be ineligible to receive
                     CARES Act funds.&nbsp;Students who may not qualify for federal financial&nbsp;assistance, or
                     who may have needs related to housing insecurity,&nbsp;may submit a <a href="https://etsu-advocate.symplicity.com/care_report/index.php/pid163463">care report</a> to the&nbsp;Office of the Dean of Students to&nbsp;apply for emergency funding&nbsp;provided by
                     the Buccaneer Student Crisis Fund.&nbsp;&nbsp;
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>ETSU has taken additional steps&nbsp;beyond the creation of the Buccaneer Student Crisis
                     Fund&nbsp;to provide students with support and financial relief due to the disruptions
                     experienced by the spread of coronavirus.

                  <p>Earlier this semester, ETSU placed restrictions on university-sponsored domestic and
                     international travel.&nbsp; This was one of many decisions made as a result of the COVID-19
                     virus outbreak to protect the health of our students, faculty and staff.&nbsp;&nbsp; With that
                     same goal,&nbsp;<strong>ETSU is extending its suspension of all outgoing university-sponsored domestic travel
                        through June 15, 2020.</strong>&nbsp; In addition,&nbsp; all university-related international travel is suspended until further
                     notice.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>As noted in a previous communication, local travel associated with everyday operations
                     of the university, including blanket travel will continue.&nbsp; In addition, vehicular
                     travel outside a 50-mile radius, with the exception of other ETSU campuses, continues
                     to require supervisor approval and should be restricted to activities that are absolutely
                     necessary and cannot be rescheduled or conducted remotely.
                  </p>

                     Here in Tennessee and across the nation, conversations are also emerging about how
                     businesses and government will begin the process of resuming operations at levels

                     will proceed during the month of June.&nbsp; These decisions will be guided by the work

                     David Linville, executive vice provost for academics and health.&nbsp; The workgroup will
                     create and provide recommendations and plans to senior leadership on transitioning
                     our academic, campus, and business operations from our current remote status in a

                  <p>In light of the unprecedented circumstances emerging from the COVID-19 outbreak, it
                     is with a saddened and heavy heart that I announce our decision regarding our upcoming
                     commencement exercises. Based upon current CDC recommendations and in recognition
                     of the need to place the health and safety of our students as our foremost priority,
                     and after deliberation with the deans of our respective colleges, as well as members
                     of our Board of Trustees, we have reached&nbsp;the arduous decision to postpone our Spring
                     Commencement Exercises, and other related activities, for this academic year. This
                     decision also applies to the graduation ceremonies for the Quillen College of Medicine
                     and Gatton College of Pharmacy that were scheduled for May 8th.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p><br><br>In the coming weeks, I will share more details about a virtual commencement that is
                     being planned for May 9th and will extend an invitation to the members of the spring
                     graduating class to participate in our December Commencement Exercises. Furthermore,
                     colleges and programs that were planning to host individual commencement or award
                     ceremonies are discussing options to making those events virtual as well. Concurrently,
                     we will launch a process for assembling input to the planning process for these celebratory
                     events, which will reflect student aspirations and expectations surrounding milestone
                     moments in their academic journeys.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p><br><br>The postponement of Commencement is one of the most difficult decisions I have made
                     during my tenure as president. Commencement is my favorite season of the academic
                     year for it affords the opportunity to shake the hands of every graduate, congratulate
                     them on their accomplishments, and celebrate their success. I know what this day means
                     for students and family members as they celebrate the close of one transformative
                     journey and prepare for new journeys on the horizon.&nbsp; I also know what this day means
                     to our faculty and staff who guided and shaped the academic journeys of our students
                     and helped them realize their dreams. Although our formal commencement exercises will
                     not take place in their traditional format, the true essence of Commencement remains
                     alive across ETSU, and I look forward to celebrating the accomplishments and achievements
                     of the Class of 2020.&nbsp;

                  <p><br><em>Note:&nbsp; Information in this letter does not apply to students enrolled in the Gatton
                        College of Pharmacy or the Quillen College of Medicine – please work with the Dean
                        and Student Affairs Offices in those colleges for information concerning your Spring
                        2020 and Summer 2020 course expectations.</em></p>
                  
                  <p>The month of April brings a sense of renewal and anticipation. Over the last several
                     weeks, academic advisors, faculty, and students have been preparing for summer and
                     fall course registration which begins on Monday, April 6.&nbsp; Given the changes that
                     have taken place in recent weeks as a result of the COVID-19 outbreak, I want to bring
                     a few items regarding summer school to your attention in advance of the registration
                     process.&nbsp; Currently there are no modifications to the Fall 2020 schedule.<br><br>We have a robust offering of courses planned for the summer term, and I encourage
                     you to speak with your advisor regarding any questions about the summer school courses
                     available for your major/minor course of study.&nbsp; More information about the classes
                     being offered can be found in GoldLink, and I invite you to learn more about the upcoming
                     registration dates by visiting Registrar’s Office at <a href="/reg/registration/resources.php">https://www.etsu.edu/reg/registration/resources.php</a>&nbsp;.<br><br><strong>Summer Term Modifications and Information:&nbsp;</strong></p>
                  
                  <p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All courses offered during the summer 2020 term at ETSU will be taught online.<br><br>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For the summer 2020 term only, <strong>all online fees will be waived.<br></strong><br>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All ETSU Study Abroad and other international programs in summer 2020 are
                     cancelled.&nbsp; However, study abroad programs for fall 2020 and beyond are anticipated
                     to continue as usual.<br><br>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Courses requiring a lab, clinical, or other face to face experiential learning
                     experiences may have altered schedules for summer term.&nbsp; Faculty and advisors within
                     your colleges and specific programs will have information that will be useful to you
                     in planning your summer schedule for these courses.<br><br>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If individual student schedule changes become necessary for summer or fall
                     as a direct result of the Covid-19 pandemic limiting access to certain clinical facilities
                     and/or face to face experiences, course schedules will be adjusted and the drop-add
                     fee will be waived
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>As you complete Spring Semester, the faculty are aware that many students have experienced
                     significant hardships during this time since Spring Break. The Covid-19 pandemic has
                     necessitated many changes in how we perform our work.&nbsp; Recognizing the many challenges
                     to undergraduate students and faculty as they rapidly transition to on-line and other
                     remote teaching modalities, the Academic Council has approved some safety net modifications
                     to academic policies.&nbsp;
                  </p>
                  
                  <p><strong>Accommodations for Undergraduate Students for Spring 2020 include:</strong></p>
                  
                  <p>1.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Pass/Fail</strong> &nbsp;policy will be relaxed&nbsp; to allow undergraduate students to make the decision for
                     a pass/fail grade on a course-by-course basis (please see the <a href="/coronavirus/documents/face-shield_v2/modification-to-pass-fail-grading-policy-3-30-20-final.pdf">official policy modification statement</a> which will be posted on the Provost’s website and on the ETSU Coronavirus website
                     – student tab).&nbsp; Here are some key highlights:
                  </p>
                  
                  <ul>
                     
                     <li>Undergraduate students do not have to make this decision until <strong>after</strong> they receive their grades for the semester…the deadline for applying for a P/F grade<strong> has been extended to June 15</strong>…that’s right you can see what grade you earned before you make the decision to have
                        a course graded P/F.&nbsp; To convert a letter grade for Spring Semester to a P grade you
                        need to make an appointment with your advisor&nbsp; who you will help you consider the
                        advantages and/or disadvantages to your GPA, progress to graduation, or impact on
                        admission to selective admissions programs, graduate or professional schools.&nbsp; You
                        must request to have a course grade converted to a Pass – a P or Pass grade reflects
                        an earned grade of A, B, C, or D.
                     </li>
                     
                     <li>The minimum GPA requirement for requesting a P/F grade has been removed for Spring
                        2020.
                     </li>
                     
                     <li>There is no restriction on the number of credits that may be requested for P/F grades
                        and the number of courses requested for P/F grading in Spring 2020 will not limit
                        any future requests for P/F grading.
                     </li>
                     
                  </ul>
                  
                  <p>2.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>Academic dismissals</strong> will be suspended in Spring 2020.&nbsp; Students, however, may be placed on academic probation
                     as warranted.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>3.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<strong> A Transcript notation</strong> will be placed on all academic records, regardless of grading basis, indicating the
                     extraordinary circumstances of the global health emergency during Spring 2020.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>4.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <strong>Incomplete Grading for Undergraduate Students</strong> will still be allowed.&nbsp; Students should check with their academic advisors before
                     opting for an incomplete grade as this may affect financial aid awards.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>5.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<strong> Grade appeal process</strong> remains in effect and is unchanged.<br><br><em>Note: The Academic Deans’ List to recognize excellence will still be published – but
                        the publication of the list will be delayed to allow time for processing of P/F grade
                        requests.</em></p>

                  <p>1.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Academic dismissals for GPA will be suspended in Spring 2020.&nbsp; However, students
                     may be placed on probation if the GPA is lower than the required 3.0 for graduation.<br><br>2.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; While Pass/Fail grading is not available to graduate students, given the circumstances
                     surrounding the Covid-19 pandemic and potential difficulties with completion of research
                     and laboratory experiences, faculty are encouraged to use broader discretion in assigning
                     a grade of “I” (Incomplete) in Spring 2020.<br><br>3.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A transcript notation will be placed on all graduate academic records indicating
                     extraordinary circumstances due to the global health emergency during Spring 2020.<br><br>4.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In order to graduate, graduate students will be required to have a 3.0 GPA
                     overall and in their programs of study.<br><br>Every student’s success is important to us.&nbsp; Please know that your ETSU faculty and
                     staff are your advocates and are willing to work with you as you make grading choices
                     and decisions about your class schedule in the weeks ahead.<br><br>While we are all working remotely, your university is still here for you.&nbsp; Please
                     reach out for academic or personal guidance.&nbsp; Stay in touch with your faculty and
                     your friends.&nbsp; Register for your classes and make your plans for the future.&nbsp; I, like
                     you, look forward to the time that our campus is filled with the sounds of students
                     greeting each other on the way to class, the marching band preparing for half-time
                     shows, ROTC cadets running in cadence, and the Carillon tolling the hour.&nbsp; Yes, I
                     even look forward to having to “hunt” for a parking space…because everyone will be
                     back on campus and our routines will be restored.<br><br>Thank you for being part of the ETSU community.&nbsp; Go Bucs!

                  </h3>
                  
                  <p>East Tennessee State University has learned that two members of its community have
                     tested positive this week for the COVID-19 virus. One of the cases involves a student,
                     and the other is an employee, and there is no connection between these two cases.
                     We are pleased to report that both individuals are continuing to improve.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>The Northeast Tennessee Regional Health Office coordinated contact tracing for both
                     of these cases and will notify anyone who may have been in contact with these two
                     individuals. Moving forward, the university will not provide updates on every confirmed
                     COVID-19 case among our students, faculty, and staff. We send our best wishes to these
                     two individuals and to the entire ETSU community and region during this challenging
                     and difficult time.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>For any questions related to coronavirus, including symptoms, testing, or exposure,

                  </h3>
                  
                  <p>With an increase in regional COVID-19 testing capacity, ETSU Health will close its
                     drive-through COVID-19 testing site, located at 325 North State of Franklin, effective
                     April 1, 2020. While the drive-through site will no longer be open, ETSU Health will
                     continue to administer COVID-19 testing in its clinics.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>"The local health department has just opened their drive-through testing sites in
                     Washington County and the surrounding counties," said Dr. Jonathan Moorman, chief
                     of the Division of Infectious Diseases at East Tennessee State University’s Quillen
                     College of Medicine. "These new sites are open to the public and, along with Ballad
                     Health testing sites, are large enough to handle the demand for testing in our region
                     at this time. These sites will test patients with symptoms of COVID-19 just as ETSU
                     has done. We do not want to duplicate the same services they will be offering at these
                     new sites."
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>Since its opening on March 17, ETSU Health’s drive-through site has administered approximately
                     500 COVID-19 tests. The site was one of the first drive-through testing sites in Tennessee
                     and was instrumental in detecting the first few cases of community spread of COVID-19
                     in the Appalachian Highlands.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>"While we will not offer our own drive-through testing, ETSU Health will continue
                     to test in our clinics and to work closely with the Health Department and our health
                     care partners throughout the region to monitor the community spread of COVID-19,"
                     Moorman said. "We are committed to continuing our efforts on the front lines to prevent,
                     diagnose and treat the spread of the coronavirus."
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>Individuals with symptoms of COVID-19 including fever, cough, and shortness of breath

                     on testing sites.

                  <p>Dear ETSU students,&nbsp;</p>
                  
                  <p>Today Governor Bill Lee issued a "Safer at Home" order for residents of Tennessee&nbsp;in
                     an effort to&nbsp;curb the ongoing spread of the coronavirus. This order will be in effect&nbsp;from
                     11:59 p.m., March 31,&nbsp;through&nbsp;11:59 p.m. April 14, 2020. &nbsp;During this time, it is
                     imperative that you stay at your residence as much as possible and that you minimize
                     your contact with other people.&nbsp;
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>ETSU has taken several actions to help stop the spread of coronavirus and the Governor's
                     order is consistent with the efforts that we have already undertaken. Faculty and
                     students have transitioned to online coursework, and most staff are working and providing
                     services remotely. This community effort has shown the true spirit of being part of
                     the Buccaneer family.&nbsp;

                  <h3>Emergency Grading and Accomodations for Spring 2020<br>Memo to faculty and staff 3/30/20
                  </h3>
                  
                  <p>Dear ETSU Colleagues,</p>
                  
                  <p>Earlier today during a called meeting, the ETSU Academic Council approved the <a href="/coronavirus/documents/modification-to-pass-fail-grading-policy-3-30-20-final.pdf">Response to COVID-19 Emergency Grading Accommodation for Spring 2020</a>&nbsp;recommendation that now allows ETSU undergraduate students to choose the pass/fail
                     (P/F) option for some or all undergraduate courses in which they are registered for
                     the Spring 2020 semester.&nbsp; This modification to the policy for undergraduate students
                     will go into effect on March 31, 2020. Details related to submitting a P/F application
                     – including timing and process – will be announced as soon all advisors are informed
                     and a process identified to handle these requests. Please note that the modification
                     is written so undergraduate students can actually determine a final course grade prior
                     to opting for a P/F grade instead. A copy of the “Response to COVID-19 Emergency Grading
                     Accommodation for Spring 2020” document is attached.&nbsp; Major highlights of the approved
                     accommodation include:
                  </p>
                  
                  <ul>
                     
                     <li><strong>Undergraduate students</strong>&nbsp;have until&nbsp;<strong>June 15, 2020</strong>, to exercise the option to request a P/F grade for a course. This is only applicable
                        for ETSU undergraduate students.
                     </li>
                     
                     <li>The request for a P/F grade is made to the academic advisor and is then submitted
                        to the academic dean (or designee) for final approval.
                     </li>
                     
                     <li>Advisors will discuss with students the potential impact that earning a P/F grade
                        may have on financial aid, scholarships, future graduate school applications, licensure,
                        or other matters.
                     </li>
                     
                     <li>College deans (or designee) have the authority to deny requests for P/F grading in
                        the event this option could have a negative impact on the student’s long-term progression.
                     </li>
                     
                     <li>At this time, this emergency modification of the Pass/Fail policy only applies to
                        courses offering during the Spring 2020 semester.
                     </li>
                     
                  </ul>
                  
                  <p>Regarding&nbsp;<strong>graduate students</strong>, pass/fail is not an option. However, faculty are encouraged to use broader discretion
                     to assign a grade of Incomplete as circumstances around the move to remote learning
                     and COVID-19 warrant.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>I want to thank our student and campus leaders for their attentive and thorough efforts
                     during the past two weeks in creating this emergency grading accommodation.&nbsp; A Working
                     Group was convened that conducted an extensive review of how other institutions oversee
                     this process and also sought feedback and guidance from stakeholders such as Financial
                     Aid, academic advising, department chairs, the Student Government Association, and
                     Faculty Senate, among others.&nbsp; I commend this Working Group for their outstanding
                     work, and the members of the Academic Council for the thorough discussion of how this
                     modification can benefit our students.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>Again, please take the opportunity to review this new grading accommodation closely,
                     and should you have any questions, your academic dean will be willing to respond.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>Thank you, and best wishes as we continue through this journey together.</p>

                  </h3>
                  
                  <p>Dear Colleagues,</p>
                  
                  <p>The pandemic situation with Covid-19 is evolving rapidly.&nbsp; Over the weeks ahead, the
                     University will be using several channels to communicate with you, as this is a very
                     fluid situation and guidelines and parameters for action do change.&nbsp; Please check
                     the university’s corona virus website (<a href="/coronavirus/">https://www.etsu.edu/coronavirus/</a>) frequently for the latest information.&nbsp; In addition, you will receive specific updates
                     that will often require attention and action on your part as faculty and staff.&nbsp; This
                     is one of those messages.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>In light of Dr. Noland’s communication today, I am sending this message to faculty
                     and staff about the continuity of our education, service, and research missions. We
                     are poised to resume instruction on Monday in an online format. I greatly appreciate
                     all of the hard work of faculty and staff over the past several days to ensure we
                     are ready for this transition. We must now pivot to provide online instruction for
                     the remainder of semester. This will require continued flexibility, creativity, and
                     understanding on the part of all faculty, staff, and students. Faculty should continue
                     working with their chairs and deans to maintain instructional continuity, keeping
                     students on track to graduation.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>ETSU Health will continue to provide health care through its clinics operated by the
                     Quillen College of Medicine and the College of Nursing. Faculty and staff who work
                     in those clinics will continue to receive specific information and guidance about
                     clinical operations from ETSU Health leadership. Other university service activities
                     that cannot be accommodated in a remote or online fashion should be suspended.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>As noted in Dr. Noland’s communication, we are moving to greatly limit the number
                     of individuals on campus. This is an action based on the university’s commitment to
                     flattening the pandemic curve. This requires further limitations in research activities
                     on campus. Faculty members are being asked to suspend their on-campus research activities.
                     Faculty members should work directly with their Chairs and Deans to wind down on-campus
                     research activities. Contingency plans provide for the continued care of animals.
                     Specific challenges that Faculty may encounter related to suspending research activities
                     must be addressed with chairs, deans, and the Vice Provost for Research.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>Today’s communication limiting access to campus means that Graduate Assistants cannot
                     be working on campus to support administrative, research, or teaching activities.
                     Their work must either cease or transition as appropriate to a remote or online location.
                     &nbsp;
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>During this semester of online instruction, faculty members may not convene with their
                     students physically face-to-face in a group either on-campus or off-campus. For example,
                     faculty may not gather with their students at a local restaurant or other public venue
                     for class.&nbsp;
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>If faculty and staff have materials or documents in their offices which they need
                     to retrieve to continue your work in a remote location, please make plans/arrangements
                     to do so as soon as possible.&nbsp; It is anticipated that there will be very limited access
                     to buildings after Tuesday of next week.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>While the above parameters impose restrictions that are foreign to our academic culture,
                     these restrictions are being put in place for the health and well-being of our campus
                     community and the region. It is imperative that we move aggressively as a University
                     and region to activities that prevent illness and avoid the spread of the corona virus.&nbsp;
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>We are fortunate at ETSU to have the infrastructure and support structures available
                     to rapidly move to remote teaching modalities.&nbsp; I am very appreciative of the work
                     that Dr. Karen King and her colleagues in Information Technology Services and Dr.
                     Amy Johnson and her colleagues in the Center for Teaching Excellence have done this
                     week to assist with the on-line transition.&nbsp; I am receiving reports from each College
                     today on the readiness for instruction on Monday.&nbsp; The Deans, Chairs, Faculty and
                     Staff have done an amazing job of responding to this challenge.&nbsp; The resilience and
                     the “can-do” attitudes that I have encountered all week assures me that as a University
                     Community we are focused on our students and our mission of assuring that they receive
                     the best education possible and are able to continue progress to achieve their educational
                     and career goals.&nbsp; During these final weeks of the semester, it will important that
                     we keep our Community focused on that mission. &nbsp;Let’s all look for ways we can lift
                     each other up,&nbsp; keep spirits buoyed, and meet challenges with creativity and hopefulness.&nbsp;
                     Out of adversity comes strength and opportunity.&nbsp; &nbsp;

                  <h3>COVID-19 Update<br>Memo to faculty, staff and students 3/20/20
                  </h3>
                  
                  <p>Dear Members of the ETSU community,</p>
                  
                  <p>As we approach the conclusion of spring break and resume classes on Monday, I want
                     to thank everyone for the patience and dedication exhibited over the past week as
                     we collectively strive to meet our teaching, research, and service missions.&nbsp; Our
                     campus has worked around the clock to bring classes into on-line formats, develop
                     new operating procedures so that staff can work remotely, implement enhanced support
                     structures for our residential students, and countless other initiatives that rise
                     above and beyond traditional job responsibilities. I convey my deepest and profound
                     respect to the entire ETSU family for the manner in which we have come together in
                     service to our university.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>In light of a rapidly changing national landscape, ETSU will implement a series of
                     new steps to ensure that we are positioned to play a leadership role on regional and
                     state efforts to flatten the curve of the spread of the COVID-19 virus.&nbsp; Early next
                     week, we will significantly reduce the scope of public access to our campus.&nbsp; We do
                     not take these actions lightly but do so in an effort to secure the health, safety,
                     and welfare of our campus community. We strongly encourage faculty and staff in the
                     coming days to retrieve materials from their offices that you will need to ensure
                     our continuity of operations. By the middle of next week, it is anticipated that access
                     to campus buildings and facilities may be subject to further limitations. As we witness
                     the emergence of COVID-19 cases at sister institutions across our region, we must
                     recognize the extraordinary circumstances that define our near and distant horizons.
                     At this time there are no reported cases of COVID-19 virus among the ETSU community.&nbsp;
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>The following outline a series of updates related to the operations of the university:</p>
                  
                  <p>· All classes will remain in an online delivery methodology through the close of the
                     spring 2020 semester. While our initial plans entailed the intent for all academic
                     instruction to occur online through April 9th, the rapidly changing public health
                     landscape necessitates that all courses remain online through the remainder of the
                     spring semester.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>·&nbsp; A decision about Commencement, which is scheduled for Saturday, May 9, has not
                     been made at this time.&nbsp; We will provide an update on plans for graduation as soon
                     as possible.&nbsp; All other public events planned for the remainder of the semester are
                     hereby canceled.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>·&nbsp; To the maximum extent possible, employees should work remotely until further notice.
                     I recognize that not all employees can work remotely, and supervisors are thereby
                     required to notify their appropriate Vice-President of those staff who are required
                     to report to campus for their work assignments.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>·&nbsp; With the conclusion of spring break, many students have anticipated returning to
                     campus for the remainder of the spring semester.&nbsp; I strongly urge all students to
                     either remain at home or return to their homes as possible.&nbsp; Students who have previously
                     received an exemption to live in the residence halls are encouraged to review the
                     need for that exemption in light of the most recent changes to course delivery.&nbsp; This
                     recommendation is made for the health and safety of the entire campus community and
                     is based upon emerging CDC recommendations.&nbsp; For those students wishing to check out
                     of housing, the Division of Housing and Residence Life will provide details regarding
                     checkout processes and protocols.&nbsp; For those students who must remain on campus, ETSU
                     is here to support you, and the Division of Housing and Residence Life will provide
                     you with information regarding adjustments to housing and food service that will be
                     implemented for the remainder for the spring semester.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>· The university is developing a process for those students whose housing and dining
                     service fees were covered through out-of-pocket expenses to receive prorated refunds/credits.&nbsp;&nbsp;
                     Information on how refunds and/or credits will be issued is forthcoming and should
                     be finalized by mid-April.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>· As we move to limit the number of individuals on campus, we must also enact limitations
                     on research activities physically underway across ETSU. I am asking that faculty members
                     move to suspend their on-campus research activities. Faculty should work directly
                     with their chairs and deans to wind down on-campus research activities. Challenges
                     to suspending research activities must be addressed with chairs, deans, and the Vice
                     Provost for Research.&nbsp; Additionally, Graduate Assistants should not be working on
                     campus to support administrative, research, or teaching activities. Their work must
                     either cease, or transition, as appropriate to a remote or online location.&nbsp; Finally,
                     contingency plans are in place for the DLAR.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>· The <a href="https://libraries.etsu.edu/home">Sherrod Library</a> will be closed to visitors, but online access to services will continue. In addition
                     to the resources at the Sherrod Library, multiple national databases such as JSTOR
                     have opened their services to public access. The library will provide information
                     regarding how to access materials not available in our collection in the coming days.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>· Extensive cleaning and sanitation started last week in ETSU buildings and will continue.&nbsp;
                     All buildings will be locked, and faculty and staff with keys may have limited access
                     to their offices and classrooms.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>· Our <a href="http://www.etsu.edu/coronavirus">COVID-19 website</a> provides the most current information on any changes and updates to university operations.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>Next week will be a time of significant transition for our all of us, and I thank
                     you in advance for your patience as we move through these unprecedented times.&nbsp; I
                     understand that the final stretch of the spring semester will proceed in a way that
                     none of us envisioned; however, our focus on our institutional mission and commitment
                     to our students are unwavering. While our work formats have changed, we remain open
                     for business and focused on improving the quality of life for the people of this region.&nbsp;
                     Thank you for your understanding during this time of uncertainty.
                  </p>

                  <p>&nbsp;We are excited to announce ETSU Health will open an outpatient coronavirus testing/collection
                     site at 2pm on 3/17/2020. The site will be located in the parking lot of the ETSU
                     Health clinic, located at 325 North State of Franklin Rd.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>&nbsp;Pre-registration will be <strong>required</strong> via ETSU Health’s Coronavirus Testing Hotline (423-433-6110), and <strong>registration will be unavailable at the collection site</strong>. The Hotline screening will involve a series of questions to determine if the caller
                     needs testing; these questions will be related to fever and respiratory symptoms.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>&nbsp;Access to the site will be via Professional Park Drive from the stoplight on State
                     of Franklin Road. Testing must occur on the same date of registration, and patients
                     must arrive in a private car with functioning windows to minimize exposure to the
                     health care workers at the testing site. The patient will also be tested for influenza

                  <p>&nbsp;Collected samples will be sent to a commercial testing entity such as LabCorp, and
                     both insured and uninsured patients will be accepted. &nbsp;Test results may be received
                     within 72 hours, but this will depend on the volume of swabs the testing lab receives.
                     Patients will be called with either negative or positive results; positive results
                     will be forwarded to the health department. All patients will be asked to self-quarantine
                     until the test results are received.

                  <p>&nbsp;Patients needing medical evaluation should contact their primary care physician.
                     If not already established with a physician, they are welcome to call ETSU Internal
                     Medicine (423-439-7280) or ETSU Family Medicine (423-439-6464).&nbsp;&nbsp; ETSU Health clinics
                     will continue to provide coronavirus testing within the clinic sites. Patients coming
                     to clinics are advised to call the clinic so that staff will be expecting them. These
                     patients will be given a mask and gloves upon entry to the clinic for their protection
                     and the protection of other patients.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>&nbsp;The total number of patients screened at the outpatient site will be limited for
                     the first few days to fine-tune processes and keep our health care providers safe.
                     The ETSU Health’s Coronavirus Testing Hotline can be reached at <strong>423-433-6110</strong>. Registration hours are 8am-3pm and collection site hours are 8:30am-4pm.

                  </h3>
                  
                  <p>Dear ETSU Community,</p>
                  
                  <p>As we announced in yesterday’s Weekly Update (March 16), staff has been planning for
                     a process that allows for continuity of operations, affording the opportunity for
                     designated staff and faculty to work from remote locations.&nbsp; The Office of Human Resources
                     has been working with campus leaders to develop a protocol for select employees to
                     transition to a remote/distance/alternative work environment.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>Tomorrow, the Office of Human Resources will provide information to campus employees
                     regarding this matter which, given the extraordinary circumstances this university
                     and our nation are currently facing, will temporarily replace our existing current
                     telecommuting policy until further notice.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>We are actively striving to answer questions and resolve issues as they arise, and
                     we thank you for your patience.&nbsp; ETSU’s anticipate that a significant volume of staff
                     will be working from remote/distance/alternative locations in the upcoming days.&nbsp;
                     It is critical to note that the university will remain open throughout the days and
                     weeks to come.&nbsp; The institution’s commitment to our students and to our teaching,
                     research and service mission will not waiver.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>Thank you for all you do for ETSU.</p>

                  </h3>
                  
                  <p>Dear ETSU Staff,</p>
                  
                  <p>As we approach the close of what has been an unprecedented week on our campus, I want
                     to take this opportunity to thank our dedicated team of staff members for all you
                     have done to support our students, faculty, and each other as we have navigated significant
                     operations changes as a result of the COVID-19 outbreak. I recognize that this has
                     been a time of great uncertainty and concern as we transition all academic instruction
                     online. There are many unanswered questions regarding how this will affect our daily
                     operations. Please note that we are doing our best to answer these questions as quickly
                     as we can, and I thank you for your patience as we work through a diversity of issues.
                  </p>
                  
                  <ul>
                     
                     <li>Before many of us leave campus for the weekend, I want to provide you with a few updates
                        and, again, express my appreciation to everyone for your outstanding efforts over
                        the past week and in the weeks to come.<br><br></li>
                     
                     <li>The university will remain open under normal operating hours during spring break.
                        However, the Basler Center for Physical Activity and a few other services will be
                        closed. Staff members at these locations should expect to receive alternative assignments.<br><br></li>
                     
                     <li>&nbsp;Please take care of yourself and get some rest this weekend. This has been an incredibly
                        busy and stressful week. I encourage you to take time to reflect on the week and give
                        thanks for all that we have and will accomplish together at ETSU.<br><br></li>
                     
                     <li>&nbsp;Earlier this week, we launched a <a href="/coronavirus/announcements.php">website</a> where you can follow our response to the COVID-19 outbreak. I invite you to visit
                        this site regularly and to monitor your email inbox for further updates.<br><br></li>
                     
                     <li>I understand that this is a very stressful time for us as a campus community and a
                        nation. Should you need assistance through our Employee Assistance Program, please
                        call 1-855-Here4TN (855-437-3486).<br><br></li>
                     
                     <li>&nbsp;If you become ill, please do not come to work. The <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html">CDC</a> has offered important tips for lowering your risk for acquiring the COVID-19 virus

                  <h3><strong>Appreciation and Information</strong><br><strong>Memo to faculty 3/13/20</strong></h3>
                  
                  <p>Dear Faculty Colleagues,</p>
                  
                  <p>As we complete a week of focusing on how we as a university community can ensure that
                     we maintain academic and business continuity for our students, faculty, and staff,
                     I want to reach out to you as ETSU Faculty to personally express my gratitude for
                     your willing spirit, positive attitudes, and energy.&nbsp; These are critical ingredients
                     for us as a University Team as we go through the next few weeks of change and uncertainty.&nbsp;
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>As a collective faculty, you are offering nearly 3000 classes to students this semester
                     of those classes close to 800 of them have been offered in an entirely online modality
                     since the beginning of the semester.&nbsp; That means that between now and the week after
                     Spring Break, we are looking at moving a significant number of classes to an online
                     format.&nbsp; For some of you, this will not be a new experience, for others you will be
                     making a transition to a new teaching style that at first will likely move you from
                     your proverbial comfort zone.&nbsp; For that reason, the Center for Teaching Excellence
                     (CTE) and Academic Technology Services (ATS) are providing resources that will assist
                     you with navigating our already existing learning management system (D2L) and our
                     teleconferencing capability available through Zoom.&nbsp; Yesterday, with assistance, I
                     offered a Zoom connection for the Academic Council meeting.&nbsp; I am planning for our
                     next Academic Council meeting to be held entirely using Zoom technology.&nbsp; This is
                     different and will require new ways of interacting, listening, and decision-making.&nbsp;
                     I realize that, but I know we are a community of learners and problem solvers.&nbsp; I
                     am confident that our faculty will be able to respond creatively and enthusiastically
                     to the challenge.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>Please visit <a href="/teaching/">CTE’s web site</a> for tips and strategies (Basic Principles) for transitioning your course from face
                     to face instruction to an online modality.&nbsp; Visit the <a href="/its/classroom/ats/support/support.php">ATS web site</a> &nbsp;for information on schedules for training sessions.&nbsp; Also, we have had a number
                     of faculty within colleges across campus volunteer to assist others with the transition
                     of courses to online.&nbsp; Please take advantage of offers from your colleagues to assist.&nbsp;
                     I know that during the first few weeks of transition we all need to have grace and
                     leniency…for ourselves and our students as we adapt to change. &nbsp;This is a process
                     that you cannot just flip a switch and have it occur.&nbsp; I do know that the next few
                     weeks will be busy and often stressful, but as one faculty told his dean this week,
                     “I will figure out a way to get it done.”&nbsp; I know that each of you is dedicated to
                     providing our students with a quality education.&nbsp; Thank you for your efforts that
                     will minimize disruption and allow students to progress toward their goal of graduation
                     and success in their future.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>With appreciation for all that you do every day for our students and ETSU.</p>

                  <h3><strong>COVID-19 University Operating Status</strong><br><strong>3/12/20</strong></h3>
                  
                  <p>East Tennessee State University officials continue to monitor the COVID-19 outbreak.
                     In light of this fluid situation and with the health and safety of our ETSU Community
                     as the top priority, the university is taking the following actions for all locations:<br><br>• All current face-to-face courses will move online effective Monday, March 23 for
                     three weeks (through April 9) as university officials continue to evaluate COVID-19
                     mitigation efforts. Everyone should prepare for online courses to extend through the
                     entire semester if necessary. Prior to April 9, the university will announce the official
                     decision on resuming face-to-face courses. Students will not be charged any additional
                     fees for courses impacted by this change. Experiential learning experiences such as
                     student teaching, service learning, clinical rotations and internships will continue.
                     Faculty will provide students with additional information about their specific courses.
                     Current online classes will continue as scheduled.<br><br>• Students should stay home after spring break and resume classes online from their
                     permanent residence. Please recognize the transition to online course work will require
                     flexibility and patience on the part of faculty and students. Students living in campus
                     housing who are unable to return to their permanent residence or are participating
                     in experiential learning experiences may apply for an exemption to remain on campus.
                     Residents will receive instructions and further information by email from the Department
                     of Housing and Residence Life. University officials are exploring options that may
                     allow potential credit or prorating for unused portions of housing and meal plans
                     if face-to-face courses do not resume for the spring semester.<br><br>• All ETSU events scheduled through April 13 are cancelled; however, some events may
                     be rescheduled at a later date and updates will be provided. During this time, in-person
                     gatherings or employee/student organization meetings should be minimized. Everyone
                     is encouraged to follow recommended COVID-19 mitigation procedures and social-distancing.
                     Please take advantage of teleconferencing resources available through Zoom. <br><br>• Most other university operations, with the exception of face-to-face courses and
                     activities listed above, will continue. Faculty and staff will continue to report
                     to work at this time. Students with appointments on campus, such as advising or meetings
                     with faculty, are encouraged to have those meetings using phone or Zoom. <br><br>Everyone is encouraged to engage in social distancing for meetings and gatherings
                     and to follow mitigation protocols recommended by Centers for Disease Control and
                     Prevention. Please continue to check your email throughout spring break for additional
                     announcements. The latest information, including resources and previous announcements,

                  <h3><strong>COVID-19: Domestic Travel Suspended</strong><br><strong>Memo to faculty, staff and students 3/11/20</strong></h3>
                  
                  <p>As part of our ongoing efforts to monitor the COVID-19 outbreak and to protect the
                     health of the campus community, East Tennessee State University has made the decision
                     to suspend all outgoing university-related domestic travel effective immediately.
                     This suspension is in place for domestic travel through April 30, 2020. This follows
                     the announcement from this past Monday (March 9) that all outgoing university-related
                     international travel is suspended through June 15, 2020. At this time, university-related
                     domestic athletics travel for competitive events is not restricted and we will continue
                     to follow guidance as provided by the NCAA and the Southern Conference.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>Rare exceptions for domestic travel may be considered on a case-by-case basis. Anyone
                     requesting an exception should submit this request to his or her supervisor for first
                     level review. Specific details about the implementation of this directive will be
                     available in the coming days. ETSU will reimburse employees and students for expenses
                     associated with international and domestic business trips that are canceled due to
                     COVID-19 and for which they cannot receive reimbursement through other means. This
                     includes airfare, hotel cancellation fees, conference registrations and other pre-paid
                     items. Those seeking reimbursements should work with the respective department that
                     is sponsoring the trip, and steps to cancel your domestic and international travel
                     will be available at ETSU’s coronavirus response website.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>This suspension is applicable to university-related domestic and international travel
                     and does not apply to personal travel plans. As we move closer to Spring Break, I
                     encourage you to be prudent in following information being released from the CDC regarding
                     travel alerts and any other information that is being provided from the health departments
                     and other organizations that is applicable to where you plan to travel. In regards
                     to next week’s break, anyone who plans to be away from campus next week is encouraged
                     to take items with them, such as books and laptops, which would allow them to resume
                     their academic and administrative responsibilities from a remote location if necessary.

                  <p>Our dedicated website will continue to provide the most up-to-date information regarding
                     the university’s response to the COVID-19 outbreak. Thank you for your continued attention
                     to this matter.

                  <h3><strong>COVID-19 and Planning for Spring Break</strong><br><strong>Memo to students 3/11/20</strong></h3>
                  
                  <p>As we approach Spring Break when most of you will be away from our campus, the university
                     wanted to provide an update on our planned response to the COVID-19 outbreak and offer
                     suggestions on things you should do before you leave campus.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>Many colleges and universities in the United States where outbreaks have occurred
                     have made the decision to suspend in-person, or on-ground, class meetings and to move
                     all instruction to an online format. At this time, ETSU will move forward with normal
                     class schedules and academic operations; however, depending on how this outbreak progresses
                     in our state and region, it is possible that a similar decision could be made for
                     our campus in the near future. In light of this, we encourage all students to be prepared
                     for a change in operations.
                  </p>
                  
                  <ul>
                     
                     <li>Before you leave campus for the break, take any books, items or learning materials
                        with you that you might need, such as your laptop and other devices, to complete your
                        coursework from a remote location. You should also take personal items with you that
                        you would need if you have to be away from campus for an extended period.<br><br></li>
                     
                     <li>If you are new to D2L (Desire2Learn) and Zoom – both distance learning technology
                        programs frequently used by ETSU – it is important for you to start becoming more
                        familiar. Our Academic Technology Services team has an informative&nbsp;website&nbsp;that serves
                        as a great starting place for new users.
                     </li>
                     
                  </ul>
                  
                  <p>The use of tools like D2L and Zoom will help sustain continued academic operations
                     in the event there is a disruption to on-ground classes. Our faculty understand that
                     the possibility exists that in-person classes may be moved online and are planning
                     accordingly.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>As we communicated with you yesterday, it is important to be very mindful of the&nbsp;travel
                     alerts&nbsp;and other information being released from the areas where you plan to travel
                     for Spring Break. Thank you for your continued attention to this matter, and may each
                     of you have a restful and enjoyable break.

                  <p>The COVID-19 outbreak continues to be a significant topic of concern here in the United
                     States and around the globe.&nbsp; ETSU has been closely following this situation since
                     early January and has adhered to the guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control
                     and Prevention regarding travel alerts and other precautions.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>I want to assure our students and parents that there is no higher priority than the
                     health and safety of our community.&nbsp; We have a team and several task forces on campus
                     that are monitoring the outbreak and are meeting daily to assess the potential impact
                     on the many aspects of our operations.&nbsp; Specifically, extensive preparations are being
                     made in the event that face-to-face class meetings are suspended for a period of time
                     and that instruction moves to an entirely online format. I also wanted to let you
                     know that additional cleaning precautions are being implemented, and we have built
                     a&nbsp;website&nbsp;that provides the latest information on ETSU’s response to this outbreak.&nbsp;
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>We encourage all students to be mindful of this situation as they finalize any spring
                     break travel plans and to closely follow the travel guidelines from the CDC and from
                     the state health departments where they may travel.&nbsp; Our pledge is to keep the university
                     community updated on any new developments or changes in operation.&nbsp;

                  <p>ETSU is committed to the progress of our students and share the belief that they deserve
                     to receive a quality educational experience. Whether that experience is on campus
                     or using online tools, we should all do everything we can to fulfill our promise to
                     our students. We anticipate adjustments to the way we conduct our teaching may be
                     necessary in order to ensure our students continue to make academic progress. We need
                     your help in making these adjustments possible.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>In the event the University suspends face to face classes for some period of time
                     this semester, all faculty need to make preparations over the next week to deliver
                     courses using our university-wide online learning tools— primarily D2L and Zoom. D2L
                     and Zoom are available to all faculty and students. If your college uses additional
                     on-line resources please be sure that all faculty and students are familiar with those
                     systems. Laboratory, clinical, performance and other experiential course offerings
                     will need to be addressed on an individual college by college basis.&nbsp; Your deans are
                     sources of information and guidance in this area. Please note that in the event of
                     suspension of face to face classes, it is likely faculty and staff will continue to
                     report to work according to current CDC recommendations.

                  <p>Effective March 9, the university is suspending all outgoing university-related international
                     travel through June 15. This includes all travel related to teaching, study-abroad
                     programs, research, internships, conferences, presentations, performances, and athletics.
                     The university will be continuously reassessing its operations in light of the evolving
                     COVID-19 situation. The Office of International Programs is working one-on-one with
                     students who are currently studying abroad. At this time, no restrictions are imposed
                     for university-related domestic travel. For university-related international travel
                     that is canceled, the university will assist with reimbursement of travel expenses
                     on a case-by-case basis.<br><br>With the university spring break March 16-20, members of the ETSU community are expected
                     to follow <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers">travel guidance from the CDC</a> in addition to any treatment or monitoring by any health official. Please keep in
                     mind that if you are planning personal travel, the university strongly recommends
                     that you be mindful of the potential risk of disruptions to your plans, especially
                     those traveling internationally. Continually changing travel restrictions may impact
                     those seeking reentry to the United States and your ability to successfully return
                     to class and/or work. Travelers returning from Level 2 or 3 CDC travel notice areas
                     will not be allowed to return to any ETSU campus or facility until they complete a
                     14-day self-quarantine and show no symptoms associated with COVID-19.<strong> The university requires that all individuals adhere to the Tennessee Department of
                        Health regulations and restrictions related to travel.</strong></p>

                     Control and Prevention, the Tennessee Department of Health and the Washington County
                     Health Department and have remained in close contact with our students participating
                     in study abroad programs in affected countries. In addition, we have shared information
                     with our campus community about important prevention steps, such as handwashing, that
                     we can take to reduce our risk.&nbsp;
