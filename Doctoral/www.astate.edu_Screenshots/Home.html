                     Plans for Fall 2020
                    </div>
                      <p>I wanted to let you know about our plans for Fall 2020. As a reminder, after a quick transition to all-online teaching in mid-semester, we recently announced that most of our summer classes will also be taught online. We have allowed certain labs and practicums to be taught face-to-face in Summer II, provided that those classes create plans that maximize physical distancing and other hygiene requirements. In all of these decisions, we have focused on ensuring that the health and safety of our faculty, staff, and students is our highest priority, while also seeking to continue delivering the highest quality learning and working environment possible.</p>

                      <p>I am pleased to share our A-State Return to Learn guidelines. Please remember that we know much more about COVID-19 today than we did in March, and we will know even more about the virus come August. The Arkansas Department of Health may establish new guidelines for higher education that may supersede our plans. For now, though, we are investing significant resources into preparing our buildings for the fall. We have also created plans for how to respond when (not if) employees and students test positive for COVID-19.

<p>If you think that you may be contagious, have been in contact with someone who was known to have coronavirus, or have traveled to an area with a known outbreak, <span style="color:red; font-weight:600">call your health provider in advance.</span> <span style="font-weight:600">Please do not show up at a clinic, urgent care or other health facility without calling first.

<p>For those on campus, the Student Health Center&rsquo;s phone number is <strong>870-972-2054</strong>.</p>
<p>For students in the Jonesboro area, St. Bernards Health Center is recommending everyone download their virtual physician interface, <a href="https://stbernardsgo.com/landing.htm" title="St. Bernards Go">St. Bernards Go</a>.</p>
<p>After registering, the St Bernards Go app will ask for you to pay a fee. For anyone with virus symptoms the fee is being waived, but you must enter COVID into the discount code box on the payment page. Then the screen will progress allowing you to pick which St. Bernard&rsquo;s physician is immediately available.&nbsp; This will allow you to speak via video conference directly to a physician.&nbsp;</p>
<p>They will ask you about your symptoms, and if you have been in direct contact with a confirmed case of the virus, and will then advise you where to go for testing. Otherwise, just treat yourself as if you would normally with a cold or flu.</p>

<div class="hidden_content">
<p>Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by a virus identified by the World Health Organization as the source of a new respiratory illness first detected in China, but since has spread to locations around the globe. As a new or previously undetected virus, it was labeled the Novel (new) Coronavirus or COVID-19. Coronaviruses are part of a large family of respiratory virus illnesses.&nbsp; Previous outbreaks of coronavirus have included severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS).&nbsp; On Jan. 30, 2020, the WHO declared the outbreak a &ldquo;public health emergency of international concern,&rdquo; and the following day, Jan. 31, 2020, U.S. Health and Human Services declared a public health emergency in the United State. On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 as a pandemic.&nbsp; <br /><br />Learn more at the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/summary.html" title="CDC Covid-19 website">CDC&rsquo;s main Covid-19 website</a>.</p>

<!-- Content placed inside "hidden_content" div -->
<div class="hidden_content">
<p>According to the CDC and Arkansas Department of Health, coronavirus is spread in the same ways as other virus illnesses like common influenza or colds.&nbsp; Your keys to limiting exposure to all viruses are similar:</p>
<ul>
<li>Wash your hands frequently for at least 20 seconds. Hand sanitizers can be an effective alternative.&nbsp; For more on handwashing, go here <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/handwashing/" title="handwashing">https://www.cdc.gov/handwashing/</a></li>
<li>Here&rsquo;s a video from CDC:&nbsp;<a href="https://youtu.be/d914EnpU4Fo" title="What You Need To Know About Handwashing">What You Need To Know About Handwashing</a></li>
<li>Disinfect surfaces that people touch frequently.</li>
<li>Avoid touching your eyes, nose or mouth &ndash; germs often spread when a person touches something contaminated and then your eyes, nose or mouth.</li>
<li>Cover your mouth and nose with your elbow if you cough or sneeze.</li>
<li>Avoid contact with people who are sick.</li>
<li>If you feel sick, please stay home.</li>

<a href="javascript:;">Should I wear a mask?</a>
<!-- Content placed inside "hidden_content" div -->
<div class="hidden_content">
<p>What kind of mask and what setting should guide your decision. Initially, federal agencies were not encouraging the general public to use masks, and they continue to say that special N95-style masks and traditional surgical masks are not advised for the public.</p>
<p>The CDC does recommend wearing cloth face coverings in public settings where other social distancing measures are difficult to maintain (e.g.,&nbsp;Campus&nbsp;<span>Store, library or offices</span>), especially in areas of significant community-based transmission. Cloth face coverings fashioned from household items or made at home from common materials at low cost can be used as an additional, voluntary public health measure.&nbsp;<span>Wearing a mask or face covering is not a substitute for physical distancing.</span></p>
<p><span>To learn more about wearing a mask, go to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/diy-cloth-face-coverings.html" title="CDC DIY Cloth face masks">https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/diy-cloth-face-coverings.html</a></span></p>

<!-- Content placed inside "hidden_content" div -->
<div class="hidden_content">
<p>Both help limit the exposure to people with contagious diseases, but it&rsquo;s helpful to know the difference.</p>
<ul>
<li>Quarantine is to separate people who were potentially exposed to a contagious disease to see if they start to display symptoms or become sick.</li>
<li>Isolation separates sick people with a contagious disease from others</li>
</ul>
<p>Currently the CDC and Department of Homeland Security have implemented Federal travel restrictions that may require travelers to enter into 14-day long quarantine due to potential COVID-19 exposure.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Arkansas State Official Travel Policy</strong></p>
<p class="policy">In response to the coronavirus pandemic, Arkansas State University is restricting all official (state- or grant-funded) travel, effective until further notice. The restrictions are as follows:
<ol>
    
<li>No official international travel will be authorized, except by direct appeal to the Chancellor for travel that fulfills A-State’s critical research, operational, or strategic mission. No official travel will be authorized to CDC Levels 2 or 3 travel warning countries. Official travel to countries from which the US currently bans entry will not be authorized.  All Study Abroad trips sponsored by A-State are cancelled for the spring, summer, and fall of 2020.</li>
<li>Official domestic travel will only be authorized if it fulfills A-State’s critical research, operational, or strategic mission. Individuals may seek permission for official domestic travel by discussing travel plans with their direct supervisors, who will forward their recommendations to Dr. Len Frey via email. Upon consultation with either the Provost or other relevant members of the campus leadership team, Dr. Frey will make recommendations to the chancellor, who retains sole authority to approve travel under this temporary policy.</li>  
<li>For personal travel, Arkansas State strongly encourages employees and students to give careful consideration to postponing it when possible until the pandemic has ended.</li>
<li>Employees or students who are authorized to travel but who have concerns about doing so shall not be compelled by anyone to travel.</li>
<li>If you do travel, please exercise caution with entering large crowds and engaging in close contact with others. Continue to practice social distancing and strong hygiene measures, such as regular hand washing, use of hand sanitizers, and covering your mouth/nose with your elbow when you cough or sneeze. 
<li>Please understand that the coronavirus risks associated with travel represents a very fluid situation at this time, and requirements for quarantine related to different travel destinations can change with little notice.</li> 
</ol><br />

US authorities currently require quarantine for passengers returning from certain areas. When we are deciding about official or personal travel plans, please consider the possibility of being in quarantine for up to 14 days if the area you have traveled from, or through, is added to the current list of containment areas. Employees who are placed in quarantine will be required to work with Human Resources on whether they can work from home, or must utilize accrued sick or annual leave.<br /><br />
Finally, if you are currently on official travel, you are not required to return immediately. </p>
