                    			<p>The committee should develop a plan for a phased campus re-activation, using metrics that are consistent with federal and state recommendations, and also appropriate for our campus setting. The focus should be on operational activities, including research, but excluding classroom teaching and (undergraduate) student life activities; there are being considered separately. Recommendations should be made to the president, <strong>not later than May 15</strong>, and should address the questions below. Note that some of these questions, e.g., about policies around travel and visits to campus, are also relevant to the committee looking into re-activating the campus for teaching, so discussion between the two committees is strongly encouraged.</p>

						<p class="mb-4">This committee has identified options for reactivating our campuses for in-person teaching, as well as the criteria to be used in deciding how and when to reactivate the Ithaca and Cornell Tech campuses for teaching.</p>

                    			<p>The committee should begin by identifying and formulating recommendations about the criteria to be used in making the determination about how and when to re-activate the campus for teaching (see, for example, the guidelines being developed at state, local, and national levels).</p>

                    			<p>They should next identify a range of options for re-activating the campus for teaching this fall, e.g.,</p>

                    			<ol>

                    				<li>full re-activation in late August;</li>

                    				<li>delaying re-activation by one or two months;</li>

                    				<li>phased re-activation with students arriving in waves;</li>

                    				<li>re-activation only for a subset of students (e.g., seniors and/or graduate and professional students, with other undergraduates online until the spring);</li>

                    				<li>and so on. Note that there are variations within each of these to consider, for example, if we had a delayed start, would we get rid of the winter break and run classes through January? Or are there other academic calendar changes that should be considered (e.g. shortened semester with minimal breaks to avoid/prevent travel</li>

                    			</ol>

                    			<p>The committee should then use the identified criteria and options to frame answers to the questions below, as well as any other questions that they determine are significant. They should make recommendations to the president, noting both the advantages and disadvantages of each option, <strong>not later than June 15</strong>. </p>

                    			<ol>

                    				<li>Should we attempt to offer all classes online, or only a restricted subset of them? If so, how would we make these decisions: as one example, would it make sense to start upper-level classes in the fall, and then defer freshmen to start in January?</li>

                    				<li>Would we work with faculty over the summer to enhance the quality of their offerings further or assume that faculty, having had the experience of the current semester, can do this on their own?</li>

                    				<li>Would we pay faculty for the extra work of converting their classes to online format over the summer?</li>

                    				<li>Would we temporarily eliminate large classes? (There has been some discussion that very large classes are especially ineffective in the current online format?)</li>

                    				<li>Would we make spring and summer offerings more robust for 2021 and beyond?</li>

                    				<li>What are the ADA issues we’d need to address?</li>

                    				<li>How would we handle technology issues? What have we learned from the current experience? For example: what do we do about students who are in very different time zones? What do we do about students who do not have reliable access to wifi? What do we do about students in China who may have VPN issues? What other issues have arisen or might arise?</li>

                    				<li>What would we offer to students outside of their online classes? Would there be any attempt at virtual co-curricular offerings? Would we continue to provide telehealth services? And if so, how would this be factored in tuition and fees? (If the students are not on campus, it seems unlikely that they will be willing to pay fees, but if they’re not paying fees we can’t provide things like health services.)</li>

                    				<li>What other changes would we implement, e.g., any changes to grading policies?</li>

                    				<li>Would it be feasible to have some students on campus, and others taking classes online? Would they be in the same classes?</li>

                    				<li>What are the financial implications? This should include a consideration of whether tuition levels should be changed.</li>
