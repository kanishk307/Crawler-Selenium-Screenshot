<h2 class="txt-h3"><a name="campus-ops"></a>Campus Operations and Contingency Planning</h2>
<div class="accordion">Is the University closed?</div>
<div class="panel">
<p>The University remains open and operational with appropriate measures to protect the health of the community.</p>
<p>In mid-March, Harvard transitioned to remote instruction, work, and research to the greatest extent possible until further notice, and the majority of students moved off campus. Certain critical staff remain on campus to sustain research and labs, support the residential population still on campus, and keep the University healthy and secure. See <a href="https://www.harvard.edu/coronavirus/teach-remotely">Teach Remotely</a>, <a href="https://www.harvard.edu/coronavirus/learn-remotely">Learn Remotely</a>, <a href="https://www.harvard.edu/coronavirus/work-remotely">Work Remotely</a>, and <a href="https://www.harvard.edu/coronavirus/research-remotely">Research Remotely</a> for more information.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.harvard.edu/coronavirus/updates-community-messages/planning-for-fall-2020">Harvard will be open for fall 2020</a>, and contingency planning for a range of scenarios is underway. Our goal is to sustain our teaching and research mission during this global pandemic, while also ensuring the health and safety of our community. <a href="https://www.harvard.edu/coronavirus/school-program-information">Each School will communicate its plans</a> for fall 2020 based on its unique considerations.</p>
<p>In line with Massachusetts' phased re-opening of the state, the University, as well as individual Schools and Units, are developing plans to gradually and safely bring students, faculty, other academic personnel, and staff back to campus as conditions allow. See <a href="https://www.harvard.edu/coronavirus/planning-2020-21">Planning for 2020-21</a> for more information.</p>
</div>
<div class="accordion">What is the University doing to protect the community?</div>
<div class="panel">
<p>The health and success of our community, on and off campus, is at the forefront of our decision making. Our goal in transitioning to remote teaching, learning, researching, and working is to protect the broader community. By reducing the number of people and opportunities for transmission of the virus on campus, we also make it possible for those who must work on campus to effectively employ social distancing strategies. These are not decisions we made lightly, but ones that we felt were right to slow the potential transmission of the virus and protect vulnerable populations from exposure. All members of the Harvard community are asked to help in these social distancing efforts.</p>
<p>Please know that we are actively contingency planning across our Schools and Units for a range of operational scenarios. We will continue to make informed decisions based on the latest science and what is best to protect the health of all members of our community while sustaining the University's central operations in support of our teaching and research mission.</p>
<p>In line with Massachusetts' phased re-opening of the state, the University, as well as individual Schools and Units, are developing plans to gradually and safely bring students, faculty, other academic personnel, and staff back to campus as conditions allow. See <a href="https://www.harvard.edu/coronavirus/planning-2020-21">Planning for 2020-21</a> for more information.</p>
</div>
<div class="accordion">Have any decisions been made about summer programs or travel?</div>
<div class="panel">
<p>We encourage you to check with your specific <a href="https://www.harvard.edu/coronavirus/school-program-information">School or program</a> about the status of summer programming.</p>
<p>University-related travel, both international and domestic, is prohibited until further notice. Personal travel, both domestic and international, is strongly discouraged and should not be planned or scheduled at this time. This guidance pertains to all community members—students, faculty, staff, postdoctoral fellows, and other academics. For more information, read the <a href="https://www.harvard.edu/coronavirus/updates-community-messages/update-international-domestic-travel-guidance">May 11 community email</a>.</p>
<p>Harvard-organized and Harvard-funded international travel for all students that is scheduled to start and end between April and August 31 is prohibited. For more information, review the <a href="https://www.harvard.edu/coronavirus/update-travel-prohibitions-summer-programs-visas">April 6 community message</a> on travel prohibitions, summer programs, and visas.</p>
</div>
<div class="accordion">Have any decisions been made about fall programs or travel?</div>
<div class="panel">
<p>As Provost Alan Garber indicated in his <a href="https://www.harvard.edu/coronavirus/updates-community-messages/planning-for-fall-2020">April 27 message to the community</a>, Harvard's undergraduate, graduate, and professional Schools will be making determinations and announcements about their plans for fall 2020 based on their own unique considerations. See <a href="https://www.harvard.edu/coronavirus/school-program-information">School &amp; Program Information</a> for each announcement.</p>
</div>
<div class="accordion">How can I donate personal protective equipment (PPE) and supplies?</div>
<div class="panel">
<p>The global Harvard University community has united in its response to the unprecedented challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic—including offers of assistance and donations of supplies and personal protective equipment (PPE) from faculty, researchers, staff, students, alumni, and friends.

</div>
<h2 class="txt-h3"><a name="classes"></a>Classes, Coursework, and Clinicals</h2>
<div class="accordion">How long will classes be online?</div>
<div class="panel">
<p>Our goal is to bring our students, faculty, postdoctoral fellows, and staff back to campus gradually and safely, and many complexities and uncertainties remain. Based on current data and projections for COVID-19, many summer courses and programs have moved online, and <a href="https://www.harvard.edu/coronavirus/updates-community-messages/planning-for-fall-2020">a range of contingency plans are underway for Fall 2020</a>. Given the hands-on nature of certain classes and clinical requirements for degree completion, <a href="https://www.harvard.edu/coronavirus/school-program-information">individual Schools</a> are working closely with their faculty and will communicate their specific instruction plans to students. </p>
</div>
<div class="accordion">Can I attend classes in person if I live nearby?</div>
<div class="panel">
<p>No. Effective March 10, Harvard began transitioning to online instruction for all graduate and undergraduate classes, to the greatest extent possible, until further notice. Given the hands-on nature of certain classes and clinical requirements for degree completion, <a href="https://www.harvard.edu/coronavirus/school-program-information">individual Schools</a> will communicate their specific instruction plans to students and faculty. Although there may be extenuating circumstances for some students to remain on campus, their instruction will be remote, and they will need to be prepared for severely limited on-campus activities and interactions. See <a href="https://www.harvard.edu/coronavirus/teach-remotely">Teach Remotely</a> and <a href="https://www.harvard.edu/coronavirus/learn-remotely">Learn Remotely</a> for more information.</p>

<div class="panel">
<p>Check out Harvard University Information Technology's (HUIT) <a href="https://huit.harvard.edu/remote-online">tips for getting online</a> during the COVID-19 period, including providers who are offering <strong>free or discounted internet and increased data allowances</strong>. If you have internet at home, review the tips for <strong>improving connection problems</strong>.</p>
</div>
<div class="accordion">How will time zone differences be handled?</div>
<div class="panel">
<p>If you know you will be in a time zone that will make the regular class time difficult for you to attend, we advise you let the faculty and teaching staff know as soon as possible. This will help them to make alterations to the teaching plan that will best accommodate the geographic spread of the students.</p>
<p>If class meetings are scheduled at a time that you cannot attend, write directly to the faculty and teaching staff to ask about expectations for attendance and alternative options.</p>
</div>
<div class="accordion">How will clinicals and in-person requirements be handled?</div>
<div class="panel">
<p>Schools are working closely with faculty to determine how courses can be meaningfully completed remotely. Should there be components of the class that simply cannot be done that way, Schools are working with faculty on alternate arrangements. Given the hands-on nature of certain classes and clinical requirements for degree completion, <a href="https://www.harvard.edu/coronavirus/school-program-information">individual Schools</a> will communication their specific instruction plans to students and faculty. For questions about specific courses, students should contact the instructor of the course.</p>

<div class="accordion">I can’t move home. Can I stay on campus?</div>
<div class="panel">
<p>We know there will be difficult and extenuating circumstances for students who cannot leave campus or do not have another place to go. Harvard will provide you the help you need to stay safe, secure, and continue with your academic work. We ask you to <strong>communicate with your School</strong> to make appropriate on-campus accommodations. Current Harvard University Housing (HUH) residents should contact the HUH leasing team at <a href="mailto:leasing@harvard.edu">leasing@harvard.edu</a> with questions. If you're not a current HUH resident, you may also wish to visit <a href="https://www.harvardhousingoffcampus.com/">Off Campus Housing Partners</a> to explore options in the area. Please note that these listing are not inspected, verified, or endorsed by HUH.</p>
<p>Students who need to remain on campus may need to relocate to a different room or unit. Although you may remain on campus, your instruction will be remote, and you will need to be prepared for severely limited on-campus activities and interactions. We encourage you to review your <a href="https://www.harvard.edu/coronavirus/school-program-information">School-specific coronavirus page</a> for more information.</p>
</div>
<div class="accordion">I live in HUH with a signed lease. Can I break the lease and stop paying rent if I leave campus?</div>
<div class="panel">
<p>Yes. For residents who wish to terminate their current HUH lease or housing contract, rent will be pro-rated if you vacate the apartment and leave campus. All obligations under the lease will end on your vacate date. Contact <a href="mailto:leasing@harvard.edu">leasing@harvard.edu</a> with questions.</p>
</div>
<div class="accordion">Will the cafes and dining halls remain open?</div>
<div class="panel">
<p>On March 15, 2020, Massachusetts Governor Baker announced that beginning on March 17, <a href="https://www.mass.gov/doc/march-15-2020-large-gatherings-25-and-restaurants-order/download">all food and drink must be taken to go and may not be consumed on-premise</a> in support of the social distancing protocols set forth by the Department of Public Health. This includes our dining halls. All students remaining on campus will be asked to utilize the dining halls for takeout only until further notice.</p>

<p>Also see: <a href="https://hr.harvard.edu/corona-virus-workplace-policies">HR's coronavirus workplace policies</a> | <a href="https://hr.harvard.edu/medical">HR's updated health plan enhancements</a>&nbsp;| <a href="https://oc.finance.harvard.edu/services/central-payroll">FAD interim payroll, I-9, and NRA processes</a></p>
<div class="accordion">Can employees work remotely?</div>
<div class="panel">
<p>Yes. Although approaches and timelines varied across the Schools and Units, most staff already began working remotely the week of March 16 and will continue to do so through at least the end of the summer, unless directed otherwise by your local leadership and managers.</p>
<p>In accordance with <a href="https://www.mass.gov/news/safer-at-home-advisory">Massachusetts' safer at home advisory</a>, only those staff who are designated as critical personnel in the context of this public health crisis should come to work if they are well. Certain critical staff must be on campus to sustain research and labs, support the residential population still on campus, and keep the University healthy and secure. As of June 8, additional workers have begun to return to campus under the state’s re-opening plan, including those participating in the re-opening of&nbsp;<a href="https://provost.harvard.edu/research-laboratory-reentry">laboratory facilities</a>. Employees returning to campus as well those who will continue to work remotely should review the&nbsp;<a href="https://hr.harvard.edu/corona-virus-workplace-policies/return-campus">updated University workplace policies</a>&nbsp;on HARVie.</p>
<p>For new employees (including graduate student workers), refer to the <a href="https://oc.finance.harvard.edu/services/central-payroll">FAD interim payroll processes</a>.</p>
<p>Because the situation is constantly evolving, all employees should follow the guidance of their local School or department. See <a href="https://www.harvard.edu/coronavirus/work-remotely">Work Remotely</a> for more information.</p>
</div>
<div class="accordion">If I can’t work remotely, will I still be paid?</div>
<div class="panel">
<p>Yes. As a general principle, Harvard is committed to sustaining the pay continuity for our dedicated and talented workforce. The University continues to place its highest priority on the health, safety and wellbeing of the Harvard community. Toward that end, and effective immediately, Harvard's workplace policies have been enhanced.</p>
<ul>
<li>People who continue working (remotely or on campus) will be paid as they are normally.</li>
<li>For <strong>Harvard employees</strong> (core staff including administrative/professional, support staff, and service and trade workers) who are well and available to work, but their duties cannot be performed remotely or because of the shifts in population on campus they no longer have work to perform, the University will guarantee their regular pay and benefits beyond June 28, 2020.</li>
<ul>
<li>Additionally, we will expand eligibility for this guarantee of pay and benefits to part-time contingent employees who are less than half time (LHT).</li>
</ul>
<li>For <strong>contract employees</strong> of Harvard’s 14 major suppliers working in dining, custodial, and security roles, the University will provide financial relief in the form of pay and benefits beginning March 10 and beyond June 28, 2020, if they are well and available for work but displaced from their contract assignments due to the COVID-19 public health emergency and unable to obtain new assignments. The University is working with these suppliers to ensure its financial support will be used for the direct benefit and financial relief of contract food service workers, custodians, and security guards.</li>
</ul>
<p>See additional <a href="https://hr.harvard.edu/corona-virus-workplace-policies">enhanced workplace policies</a> on the HR website for full details. Given the rapid changes concerning COVID-19, HR will continue to review and revise the policies as the situation evolves.</p>
</div>
<div class="accordion">Does the guarantee of salary beyond June 28, 2020 cover Harvard paid research assistants, postdocs, fellows, PhD students and research associates?</div>
<div class="panel">
<p>Yes, all research scholars, including, but not limited to fellows, postdoctoral fellows, research fellows, PhD students, and research associates (referred to as non-faculty academic appointees), who receive payments from Harvard, whether stipend or salary, also are included.</p>
</div>
<div class="accordion">How long will pay and benefits (if applicable) be guaranteed for eligible Harvard-paid non-faculty academic appointees?</div>
<div class="panel">
<p>Beyond June 28, except for those who were scheduled to terminate, or whose appointments end, sooner. A paid excused absence may be used to ensure pay continuity if work is unable to be performed remotely, up to the regular or standard workweek for the position. The excused absence option will end on the day of a previously scheduled termination or other appointment end date if it is earlier than June 28.</p>
</div>
<div class="accordion">When an hourly staff member is getting a paid, emergency excused absence, are they entitled to a shift differential on that pay, when they normally work hours that entitle them to one?</div>
<div class="panel">
<p>Yes. If staff members are well and available to work, but are <strong>not working</strong> because their work cannot be done remotely or because of a curtailment in Harvard operations, then they are eligible for a paid, emergency excused absence. The emergency excused absence pay will include a shift differential if their regular Harvard job was during hours that always or usually entitled them to a shift differential.</p>
<p>Staff members who <strong>continue to work</strong> hours that entitle them to a shift differential (on-campus or remotely) should continue to be paid a shift differential. However, staff members who continue to work, on campus or remotely, but <strong>not during hours that entitle them to a shift differential</strong>, will get regular pay. This is true even if, before the COVID-19 emergency, they were working hours that paid a shift differential.</p>
</div>
<div class="accordion">If students are no longer on campus, shouldn’t all employees work from home?</div>
<div class="panel">
<p>Not necessarily. The work of certain critical staff requires them to be on campus to support the academic mission and activities of the University, including assisting the residential population that remains on campus and keeping the University healthy and secure.</p>
<p>For critical staff who must remain on campus, Harvard is focused on measures that will be most effective, including promoting <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/downloads/stop-the-spread-of-germs.pdf" target="_blank">good hygiene practices</a>, extra surface cleaning, social distancing, and restrictions on travel, meetings, events, and visitors. See <a href="https://www.harvard.edu/coronavirus/work-remotely">Work Remotely</a> for more information.</p>
</div>
<div class="accordion">Can job interviews for open positions be conducted in person?</div>
<div class="panel">
<p>No. Job interviews for open positions should be conducted remotely via video- or teleconferencing tools like Zoom, or by telephone. Whatever approach you take, use it consistently with all applicants to the same job, so none are disadvantaged. Using fair hiring practices remains important.</p>
<p>Note that as of April 13, Harvard announced a University-wide hiring freeze. The provost and the executive vice president, in consultation with the deans and the vice presidents, will ensure appropriate processes are in place for considering exceptions.</p>
</div>
<div class="accordion">Should I come to work if I’ve had direct or indirect contact with a person diagnosed with or under investigation for COVID-19?</div>
<div class="panel">

<div class="accordion">How do I know if I’m an essential or critical employee?</div>
<div class="panel">
<p>Your manager will communicate with you about defining the list of critical personnel—those who absolutely must remain on campus—in the context of this public health crisis. Because Harvard is a 24/7 residential university, many employees must work on campus to provide essential services for residential life, campus health and safety, critical research, the protection of physical and intellectual assets, or the continuity or resumption of academic programs and operations. Note that the definition of “essential” under <a href="https://www.harvard.edu/coronavirus/essential-personnel-protocol">Massachusetts' emergency order</a> may differ from past University essential personnel lists. Please contact your manager if you have any questions about your role, and heed additional guidance from your School or Unit leadership.</p>
<p>HR is working on enhanced measures and policies to support all employees. Review the <a href="https://hr.harvard.edu/corona-virus-workplace-policies">HR coronavirus workforce policies</a>, talk with your manager about your concerns, and consult with your local HR office.</p>

<div class="accordion">Can I be refunded for a cancelled trip or event?</div>
<div class="panel">
<p>We understand the University's coronavirus-related policies have financial implications. Some transit providers are offering travel waivers or waiving cancellation fees in light of the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p>For staff and faculty travelling on University business, the <a href="https://policies.fad.harvard.edu/pages/travel-0">Harvard Travel Policy</a> allows for reimbursement of cancellation or change fees with a valid reason. The current Coronavirus pandemic meets this requirement.

<li>This <strong>will</strong> include USPS Parcels, First Class mail, or mail with endorsements requiring forwarding.</li>
<li>This <strong>will not</strong> include standard/marketing mail, periodicals, or non-profit pieces.</li>

<div class="accordion">Should I cancel my on-campus event or meeting?</div>
<div class="panel">
<p>We strongly urge canceling non-essential events or meetings of 10 people or more. This social distancing measure will limit the spread of illness. For gatherings of any size, <a href="https://www.harvard.edu/coronavirus/event-information">take steps to lower risk</a>: use video- and teleconferencing options such as Zoom; and remind attendees to <a href="https://harvard.edu/sites/default/files/content/Coronavirus_HUHS_social_distancing_A%5B3%5D.pdf" target="_blank">practice social distancing</a> and avoid shaking hands. Ensure easy access to handwashing facilities and have alcohol-based sanitizers readily available.</p>
<p>Events with speakers invited from off campus—whether the speakers are international or domestic—should be cancelled, postponed, or conducted remotely. The purpose of this guidance is to reduce the chance of transmitting illness into or out of the Harvard community.</p>
</div>
<div class="accordion">When and how can employees use Zoom for meetings?</div>
<div class="panel">
<p>Given the extraordinary additional demand anticipated, and our need to prioritize academic use, below are some basic guidelines for employees using Zoom sensibly:</p>
<ul>
<li>Consider whether you need to hold a meeting.</li>
<li><strong>Use alternative means to communicate when possible</strong> (telephone, Slack, Microsoft Teams, email).</li>
<li>If you hold a Zoom meeting, <strong>keep it short</strong>.</li>
<li>Video calls are most effective when they are 45-min or less.</li>
<li>Consider adopting a 10-min “stand-up” approach—a meeting not long enough to sit down—and focus on priorities of the day</li>
<li>Close out of your Zoom session when you are done. <strong>Do not host a persistent Zoom session</strong>.</li>

<p>The Student Health Insurance Plan provides coverage for hospitalizations, specialty care, mental health, and prescription medications throughout the United States and abroad. For more information on the Student Health Insurance Plan benefits and coverage, you can view the <a href="https://hushp.harvard.edu/student-health-insurance-plan">Harvard University Student Health Program (HUSHP) website</a> or contact HUSHP Member Services at 617-495-2008.</p>
<p>The Harvard Student Health Insurance Plan provides coverage for mental health inpatient and outpatient services outside of Harvard University Health Services (HUHS). Students can find a participating in-network provider by searching the <a href="https://myblue.bluecrossma.com/health-plan/find-doctor">Blue Cross Blue Shield of MA (BCBSMA) Find-A-Doctor website</a> (the network is PPO or EPO) or by calling the BCBSMA Behavioral Health Coordination Line at 877-566-2583. The representatives answering these calls are trained to help you find the right provider based on your concerns and the location where you wish to receive care. Students who waived the Harvard Student Health Insurance Plan should check with their private insurance for questions about their provider network, coverage rules, and potential out-of-pocket costs.</p>
</div>
<div class="accordion">Do I still have to pay the Student Health Fee?</div>
<div class="panel">
<p>Harvard University Health Services (HUHS) will remain open, and services that can be provided by a telephone call will shift to remote delivery for the continuation of many medical services that students can continue to use while away from campus. In-person Urgent Care hours are from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m., seven days a week. Visit the <a href="https://huhs.harvard.edu/about-us/announcements-events/coronavirus-information-and-updates">HUHS website</a> for details on this temporary new model of care.

</div>
<div class="accordion">I am an undergraduate student and have a job on campus. Will I continue to be paid if I’m not at work?</div>
<div class="panel">
<p>If you can continue to perform your job in a remote setting, you will continue to be paid without changes or interruptions. Talk with your supervisor about the tasks that you can continue to do safely from a distance, and be clear about how to report your time.</p>
<p>If you held a position that you are unable to continue in a remote setting, we encourage you to visit the <a href="https://seo.harvard.edu/">Harvard College Student Employment Office website</a> and review other opportunities for the remainder of the term. Consult with the Student Employment Office about how to apply for and be hired into a new job.</p>
<p>As indicated in the Harvard College Dean of Students Office <a href="https://dso.college.harvard.edu/coronavirusfaq">Coronavirus FAQs</a>, all undergraduate students who had a term-time work expectation as part of their financial aid packages for this semester will have one half of that expectation removed from their financial aid packages. For example, a spring term-time work expectation of $1,750 will be reduced to $875 and the corresponding amount replaced with additional Harvard scholarship. Undergraduate students will see this as an increase of Harvard scholarship aid on their student account.</p>
</div>
<div class="accordion">Will financial aid decisions be reconsidered for Spring 2020 or Fall 2020 given the emerging economic changes?</div>
<div class="panel">

<p>The University continues to evaluate the shifting administrative landscape during the coronavirus pandemic. Graduate student work, as part of that landscape, is an essential driver of the University’s mission. Where possible, the University expectation is that the work that graduate students are compensated for should continue. If work assignments are not possible to complete using online or distance learning technologies, supervisors are encouraged to find other opportunities for graduate student workers to complete their work commitments, including shifting jobs and job descriptions to alternate assignments in order to fulfill their employment obligations. If this is not possible, graduate student workers who are unable to work due to the pandemic will still be compensated to the end of work expectation within the spring 2020 semester.</p>

<div class="accordion">I extended my annual parking permit this spring but was notified recently that I will be working remotely until the fall. Will I still receive a credit?</div>
<div class="panel">
<p>If you extended your permit, you have paid for parking through the end of June. You will receive a 3.5 months credit (March 15th through June 30th) on a new permit. You should continue to display your FY20 hang tag when on campus. Your parking facility access is still valid. You will be able to utilize the annual parking permit renewal system when it opens later this year (dates are still tentative).</p>
<p>Extended permit holders who don’t expect to return to campus in September should fill out this <a href="https://harvard.az1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_bx5s7ivl0ybICrP">online form</a>. Your permit and access will be placed on hold until you let us know when you will be back. Credits will be applied when you resume parking. Please hold onto your current hang tag in case your return to campus changes. If you have limited internet access you can contact the Campus Service Center at (617) 496-7827.</p>
</div>
<div class="accordion">I'm an employee and would like to start driving to work instead of taking public transit. Can I cancel my MBTA pass and get a parking permit?</div>
<div class="panel">
<p>Annual parking permit holders should continue using their current hang tag and designated parking locations. Parking access, using your current hang tag, will be extended into the fall. Please continue to properly display your hang tag.</p>
<p>Employees who typically commute via transit but are now hesitant to do so because of coronavirus are now eligible for <strong>no charge</strong> daily parking through July 31, 2020 at select Harvard facilities in Cambridge and Allston. The program will be periodically reviewed and any extension will be based on future University occupancy.&nbsp;<span>All Harvard I.D. holders will have access to the HBS Surface Lot, the Webster Lot (Athletics area), the Observatory Lot, 52 Oxford Street Garage, Littauer Lot, SEAS Lot, and William James Lot. No permit pre-ordering is required. Show your Harvard I.D. for garage access. Annual permit holders will be given priority access to facilities and availability may be limited at select locations.</span></p>
<p>Parking rules continue to apply and signage regarding reserved spaces, fire lanes, and disability parking must be observed.

<div class="accordion">Can I cancel my Harvard parking permit?</div>
<div class="panel">
<p>Parking Services is currently offering two options for those who have had their commute and/or daily driving routine disrupted by coronavirus (COVID-19). <strong>Both options will ultimately result in the same refund or credit amount.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Option 1: Extend your parking permit</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>This is the easiest option as it requires no action on your part, you do not need to contact us, and your permit dates will automatically be extended. For example, if Harvard’s current remote work policy is in place for two months, a permit with the expiration date of June 30, 2020 would automatically be extended until August 31, 2020. In this scenario, permit holders would not be charged for the months of July and August. The actual dates are still unknown, but Parking Services will communicate with you once they are determined.</li>
<li>Essential personnel who must continue to drive to campus during this time will automatically have their permits extended.</li>
<li>If you choose to extend your permit, which again requires no action on your part, you can continue to park in your current location(s). Please display your existing permit through the new extended date.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Option 2: Cancel your parking</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>This option is recommended for people leaving the University or those who typically suspend parking during summer months. When the University resumes normal operations and begins charging again for daily parking, you will need to repurchase a permit. You will be charged prevailing rates based on the permit start date. We will make every attempt to process the new permit for your current parking location. Visit the <a href="http://www.transportation.harvard.edu/covidparking">Transportation website</a> for more information on how to cancel your parking.</li>
</ul>

<div class="accordion">Can graduate students and postdocs return to labs?</div>
<div class="panel">
<p>Graduate students and postdocs should consult with their supervisors for specifics on lab operations, continuity of research activities, the&nbsp;<a href="https://provost.harvard.edu/research-laboratory-reentry">re-entry plan for science labs</a>, and the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.harvard.edu/coronavirus/planning-2020-21/checklist-for-safe-return-to-labs">checklist for a safe return to labs</a>.</p>
<p>Effective March 10, all graduate students began transitioning to remote work wherever possible, and many labs began to ramp down operations the week of March 16 to sustain only essential operations. Some lab access was permitted only for the most critical needs, including for those working on research directly related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Our <a href="https://www.harvard.edu/covid-19-moving-classes-online-other-updates">March 10 email</a> about reducing the on-campus population was not a decision we took lightly, but one that we felt was right to slow the potential transmission of the virus and protect vulnerable populations from exposure. All members of the Harvard community are asked to help in this effort.&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<div class="accordion">How is the University preparing for disruptions to critical research operations?</div>
<div class="panel">
<p>The University has identified ways to protect critical research and permit only essential operations to continue. Our objectives included compiling an inventory of sensitive research that requires continued support during a disruption; preparing a plan to provide that support with limited staff, resources, and vendor provisions; and implementing existing plans for continued care of sensitive research specimens.</p>

</div>
<div class="accordion">Can I conduct research that involves physical experimentation at home?</div>
<div class="panel">
<p>Remote research using computers for data driven analytics, social behavior type studies that can be conducted by audio/video conferencing, etc. is allowable. <strong>The University cannot approve the use of private residence for research purposes.</strong> Such work at home raises a number of health and safety, and potential building and fire code related concerns that are subject to routine health and safety inspections and mitigation measure at the university laboratories and cannot be verified in a residential setting. These potential hazards include but are not limited to occupancy rating of the building (e.g. residential vs. research), electrical hazard associated with the use of the equipment (e.g. personnel safety, overload of circuitry, etc.), presence of untrained individuals in the research area, etc., none of which have been assessed by university.</p>
</div>
<div class="accordion">Can I visit my lab if I am not designated “essential personnel”?</div>

<li>Consider whether you need to hold a meeting.</li>
<li><strong>Use alternative means to communicate when possible</strong> (telephone, Slack, Microsoft Teams, email).</li>
<li>If you hold a Zoom meeting, <strong>keep it short</strong>.</li>
<li>Video calls are most effective when they are 45-min or less.</li>
<li>Consider adopting a 10-min “stand-up” approach—a meeting not long enough to sit down—and focus on priorities of the day</li>
<li>Close out of your Zoom session when you are done. <strong>Do not host a persistent Zoom session</strong>.</li>

<h2 class="txt-h3"><a name="travel"></a>Travel</h2>
<div class="accordion">Can I travel internationally on a Harvard-related trip?</div>
<div class="panel">
<p>No. All University-related international travel is prohibited until further notice and should not be planned or scheduled at this time. This policy applies to all community members—students, faculty, staff, postdoctoral fellows, and other academics.</p>
<p>Additionally, there should be no Harvard-organized or Harvard-funded international travel for students that is scheduled to start and end between April and August 31. Review the Vice Provost for International Affairs' memo for detailed information on <a href="https://www.harvard.edu/coronavirus/summer-international-travel-guidance-students">students' international summer travel funding</a>, and see Harvard Global Support Services’ (GSS) <a href="https://globalsupport.harvard.edu/news-advice/coronavirus-advice-travelers">international travel guidance</a> for more information.</p>
</div>
<div class="accordion">Should I travel abroad for a personal trip?</div>
<div class="panel">
<p>Harvard strongly discourages personal international travel until further notice (with the exception of individuals who remained in on-campus housing after Spring Recess and who will be traveling home by the end of the spring semester). Travel increases your chances of getting and spreading COVID-19. Review Harvard Global Support Services’ (GSS) <a href="https://globalsupport.harvard.edu/news-advice/coronavirus-advice-travelers">international travel guidance</a> for more information<span>.</span></p>
</div>
<div class="accordion">I’m currently abroad. Should I leave?</div>
<div class="panel">
<p>Harvard is not currently asking any affiliates abroad to leave—however, if you’re in a location where you can leave, now is the time to decide whether you stay or return home. Governments are enacting varying levels of border and travel restrictions without advance notice. Review Harvard Global Support Services’ (GSS) <a href="https://globalsupport.harvard.edu/news-advice/coronavirus-advice-travelers">international travel guidance</a> for more information.</p>
</div>
<div class="accordion">I'm an employee in one of Harvard's international offices abroad. Can I travel for business?</div>
<div class="panel">
<p>Harvard's offices abroad are part of our campus community. Staff in those offices should follow the <a href="https://globalsupport.harvard.edu/news-advice/coronavirus-advice-travelers">same guidance on international travel</a> that all members of the University are asked to follow: no international travel for University business until further notice. For domestic travel, office staff should follow local health and government travel advisories in the countries where they are based.</p>
<p>The reason that Harvard's guidance applies to staff in offices abroad is, first and foremost, to protect the health and safety of all staff and those in our communities. In addition, the University's effort to reduce travel is part of a broad effort to slow the rate of transmission and be part of the solution to this global pandemic. All members of the Harvard community in the U.S. and abroad are asked to help in this effort.</p>
</div>
<div class="accordion">Is it ok to travel within the U.S.?</div>
<div class="panel">
<p>All University-related domestic travel is prohibited until further notice and should not be planned or scheduled at this time.</p>
<p>We also strongly discourage personal travel within the United States. Travel increases your chances of getting and spreading COVID-19, and the CDC continues to <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/travel-in-the-us.html">discourage domestic travel</a>. Government restrictions and public health measures are changing rapidly.</p>
<p>If you have essential travel within the U.S., check the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/publichealthgateway/healthdirectories/healthdepartments.html">state and territorial health department websites</a> for the latest information and restrictions. Take precautions to protect yourself and others during your trip: wash your hands often or use hand sanitizer if you cannot wash them; avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth; remain at least six feet from others; and wear a <a href="https://www.harvard.edu/sites/default/files/content/06022020_coronavirus_facecoverings_A.pdf">cloth face covering</a>. Per Massachusetts law, anyone arriving or returning to the Commonwealth from elsewhere must quarantine for 14 days.</p>
</div>
<div class="accordion">What is University-related travel?</div>
<div class="panel">
<p>University-related international trips include activities that are part of academic or professional work at Harvard, including research, study abroad, attendance at a conference, academic study, travel with a student organization or trek, or a summer or January internship (or similar volunteer or work experience) if registered at Harvard the following term. An international trip is also University-related if Harvard is funding the trip or if it's at the request of a supervisor.</p>
<p>Harvard-related international travel does <strong>not</strong> include personal travel, such as vacations or trips home (for international students and scholars).</p>
</div>
<div class="accordion">Who determines essential travel?</div>
<div class="panel">
<p>As applicable, consult with your Harvard School, program, or department leaders and funding sources to determine whether your Harvard-related domestic travel is essential. There will be variance within the Schools and Units, but we strongly encourage you to consider alternative communication and collaboration methods, if possible. For individuals, you may have family or individual obligations that make your personal travel essential.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="txt-h3"><a name="visitors"></a>Visitors</h2>
<div class="accordion">Are visitors allowed on campus?</div>
<div class="panel">
<p>Harvard’s goal is to reduce the number of people on campus—including visitors—in order to slow the potential transmission of the virus and protect vulnerable populations from exposure. All members of the Harvard community are asked to help in this effort.</p>
<p>Events with speakers invited from off campus—whether the speakers are international or domestic—should be cancelled, postponed, or conducted remotely.</p>
<p>Job interviews for open positions should be conducted remotely via video- or teleconferencing tools, like Zoom, or by telephone. Note that as of April 13, Harvard announced a University-wide hiring freeze. The provost and the executive vice president, in consultation with the deans and the vice presidents, will ensure appropriate processes are in place for considering exceptions.</p>
<p>Individuals, programs, and groups are responsible for informing their guests about Harvard’s coronavirus policies. Review the <a href="https://www.harvard.edu/coronavirus/event-information">meeting and event guidance</a>. Any visitor arriving to campus from a location with a <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/index.html">CDC Level 3 Warning for COVID-19</a> must follow the same guidance as Harvard affiliates: <a href="https://www.harvard.edu/sites/default/files/content/coronavirus_CDC_HUHS_posters_2_Accessibile.pdf" target="_blank">self-quarantine</a> for 14 days in another location upon arrival/return. The CDC designation can change quickly, and anyone welcoming a visitor should confirm the location’s CDC travel designation. There is widespread, ongoing transmission of COVID-19 worldwide. This includes international locations and locations in the United States.</p>
</div>
<div class="accordion">Are campus tours still offered?</div>
<div class="panel">
<p>No. Effective March 10, all public and private in-person tours of Harvard University have been discontinued until further notice. Harvard is taking steps to minimize the need to gather in large groups and spend prolonged time in close proximity with each other. Our actions are consistent with the recommendations of leading health officials on how to limit the spread of COVID-19. We have an <a href="https://college.harvard.edu/admissions/explore-harvard/virtual-tour">online tour</a> available for anyone who would like to explore Harvard from home.</p>
