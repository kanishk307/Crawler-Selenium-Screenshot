<div>UM-Flint is continuing to align our efforts with local and state health departments’ daily screening guidance for critical/essential employees who are directed to work on campus by their supervisor<strong>.</strong>  This is intended to protect workers and limit exposure to the community. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Therefore, all essential/critical staff need to self-monitor for COVID-19 symptoms by answering the questions <a href="https://www.umflint.edu/covid-19/covid-19-self-monitoring-all-criticalessential-personnel" style="color:#1155cc" target="_blank">here</a>, informing the supervisor each day of the answers, before reporting for their shift. Employee daily health screening protocol may change.  We will continue to keep you informed, including through already established links on University websites.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Please remember that all staff must continue to observe the public health and social distancing guidelines already issued such as wearing a cloth face covering in enclosed public spaces, maintaining a 6-foot distance from others at all times, regularly washing your hands, avoid touching your face, and staying home if not feeling well. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Employee daily health screening protocol may change. Please see the attached <a href="https://www.umflint.edu/sites/default/files/groups/COVID_19/returning_home_-_guide_for_essential_workers.pdf" style="color:#1155cc" target="_blank">poster</a> from the Genesee County Health Department that provides helpful recommendations for essential employees returning to home after their shifts.</div>

<h6>Are there resources to help with timekeeping?</h6>
<p>University Human Resources has continued to work on resources which are useful in determining absences from work and coding timesheets appropriately.  The office has completed a <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1EH9Dc_H5DSU5p__02KZjzGGUDUJvoW303AaqZ_d-ris/edit?usp=sharing">google document</a> focusing on:</p>
<ul>
<li>Q&amp;As - on various topics, including Flint specific Q&amp;As.</li>
<li>Tabs - which are specific to different banks of paid time, timekeeping codes to use, unemployment compensation questions, etc.  </li>
<li>Each of the areas also includes links to websites for additional information.  </li>
</ul>
<p>The google document includes what codes to use first, what happens in the month of April when time is exhausted for temporary or workstudy employees, etc.  As more is learned about what to expect in the month of May, the document will adjust accordingly.</p>

<h6>What should an employee or supervisor do if they become aware of a member of the campus community (faculty, student or staff member) who has symptoms similar to, or believes they have COVID-19?  </h6>
<p>If the individual is an employee, including student temporary employees, the supervisor or employee should contact Suzi Bye (<a href="mailto:sbye@umich.edu">sbye@umich.edu</a> 810-766-6658), Beth Manning (<a href="mailto:bmanning@umich.edu">bmanning@umich.edu</a> 810-766-6644) or Mike Lane (<a href="mailto:mjlane@umich.edu">mjlane@umich.edu</a>). If the individual is a student, the supervisor or employee should contact Julie Snyder (<a href="mailto:jusnyder@umich.edu">jusnyder@umich.edu</a> or 810-762-5728) or Mike Lane (<a href="mailto:mjlane@umich.edu">mjlane@umich.edu</a> or 810-766-6763). We ask that you provide as much information as you know, so we can assist the individual get with the appropriate person to assist them with their medical needs, as well as appropriately manage the work environment.</p>
<h6>How do I get my paycheck if I can't come to campus? </h6>
<p>All employee paychecks which are not distributed via direct deposit will be placed in the U.S. Mail system based on the current address of record in Wolverine Access/MPathways. <a href="/suspension-flint-campus-check-distribution">Read the latest communication about paychecks.</a></p>
<h6>What should I do if an employee under my supervision or co-worker is diagnosed with COVID-19? </h6>
<p>First, remember that the employee will appreciate hearing your support while they recover from the illness. You should clarify whether they have received any specific guidance from the public health department related to others in the workplace.</p>
<p>Next, you can anticipate that other employees may have heard about, or suspect that, someone is out sick with the COVID-19 related illness. They will understandably have concern when they hear about a colleague who is ill. There will be concern for the colleague as well as concern over a potential exposure risk to themselves or others. </p>
<p>You may acknowledge that there is an individual in the unit who has tested positive for COVID-19, without identifying the individual. You may also inform employees that guidance is being sought from the county health department to determine if there is an indication for quarantine as a precautionary measure. </p>
<p>If you are in a health care setting, additional requirements to assess risk may apply and the Occupational Health reporting procedures should be followed. If employees are able to work from home and aren’t already doing so, you can offer that as an option while waiting for the county health department guidance.</p>
<p>Determining precisely what steps to take may necessitate guidance from the county health department.</p>
<p>The health department has the responsibility to perform a risk assessment for those who may have been in contact with the infected individual.</p>
<p>The health department will work with the infected individual to identify and directly notify people who have been in close contact with the person testing positive and provide specific instructions on what form or duration of quarantine is required. </p>
<p>If the health department determines that some co-workers had a low-risk exposure those co-workers will be allowed to continue to work, but should monitor themselves for symptoms of illness.</p>
<p>If the health department determines that some co-workers had a high-risk exposure those co-workers will be contacted directly by the health department with instructions to self-isolate for 14 days following exposure and contact their personal health-care provider by telephone if they become ill. Employees in this category should not come to work.</p>
<p>Supervisors also may want to consider requesting additional cleaning in the workplace. Contact the Facilities Service Center at this email address: <a href="mailto:EHS-Covid-19-reporting@umich.edu">EHS-Covid-19-reporting@umich.edu</a><br />

<h6>What do I do if an employee under my supervision or co-worker has COVID-19 symptoms and has been instructed to self-isolate?</h6>
<p>First, you can express your support to that employee while they recover from the illness, and clarify whether they have received any specific guidance from a health-care provider.</p>
<p>Next, you can anticipate that other employees may be nervous that someone is out sick. They will understandably have concern when they hear about a colleague who is ill. The concern will be for the colleague as well as concern over a potential exposure risk to themselves or others. </p>
<p>You may acknowledge that there is an individual in the unit who is self-isolating, without identifying the individual. </p>
<p>If you are in a health care setting, additional requirements to assess risk may apply and the Occupational Health reporting procedures should be followed. </p>
<p>No one who is ill, for any reason, should be working. </p>
<p>We encourage as many people as possible be allowed to work remotely.</p>
<p>With COVID-19 in the community, all employees should monitor themselves for fever, cough or difficulty breathing. </p>
<p>As long as other employees do not have symptoms, they may continue to work, while following recommended practices for social distancing.</p>
<p>If symptoms develop, employees should self-isolate, limit contact with others, and seek advice by telephone from a healthcare provider to determine whether medical evaluation is needed.</p>
<p>Supervisors also may want to consider requesting additional cleaning in the workplace. Contact the Facilities Service Center at this email address: <a href="mailto:EHS-Covid-19-Reporting@umich.edu">EHS-Covid-19-Reporting@umich.edu</a></p>

	How much information may an employer request from an employee who calls in sick, in order to protect the rest of its workforce during the COVID-19 pandemic?</h6>
<p>During a pandemic, ADA-covered employers may ask such employees if they are experiencing symptoms of the pandemic virus. For COVID-19, these include symptoms such as fever, chills, cough, shortness of breath, or sore throat. Employers must maintain all information about employee illness as a confidential medical record in compliance with the ADA.</p>
<h6 style="margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in">Are we going to remote work status?</h6>
<p style="margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in">Consistent with the <a href="http://www.michigan.gov/whitmer/0,9309,7-387-90499_90640-522625--,00.html?fbclid=IwAR0Qieuawlbgb7JnSTfA_QCZHS5N5PQPrbVV0YrWydZHB8bp6ZWniX2uPBs">Governor’s “Stay Home, Stay Safe” order</a>, and consistent with the <a href="https://www.umflint.edu/covid-19/u-m-guidelines-gov-whitmer%E2%80%99s-%E2%80%9Cstay-home-stay-safe%E2%80%9D-executive-order">messages from President Schlissel and Chancellor Dutta</a>, we want to provide some additional guidance for consideration related to employees at the UM-Flint Campus.</p>
<p style="margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in"><strong>Current Situation</strong></p>
<p style="margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in">Supervisors are managing through work arrangements to have as many employees working remotely as possible while still supporting the critical needs of the campus. Additional flexibility and creativity is needed in order to continue to serve our campus community. Face-to-face interactions should be restricted or completely eliminated if possible with those interactions moving to phone or remote options. </p>
<p style="margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in"><strong>Under the Guidelines of the New Executive Order</strong></p>
<p style="margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in">Governor Whitmer’s “Stay Home, Stay Safe” executive order gives guidance for universities to continue supporting classes and other essential work for the operation of the campus. When looking at essential/critical employee working environments, be they on campus or remote, supervisors need to look at their business continuity plans and also consider the following:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type:disc">
<li>Health and safety of faculty, staff, students and any others on the University premises – the fewer people on campus right now the better for everyone.</li>
<li>Delivery of teaching/learning processes and student-related services: </li>
</ul>
<ul style="list-style-type:disc">
<li>Employees who continue these critical services, need to work remotely to the greatest extent possible.  Supervisors and employees need to think outside of normal work environments, identify barriers that could be eliminated and work with supervisors from other units to find possible alternatives.</li>
<li>If the critical work cannot be performed remotely, the supervisor needs to provide an environment which is as safe as possible for the employee to work.  </li>
<li>If the services the employee is performing are not critical for this timeframe and cannot be done remotely, then the supervisor can work with HR and/or their Vice Chancellor to determine if the employee can be redeployed in other areas, working remotely.  </li>
<li>Identify if the essential/critical employee who has to perform critical functions on-campus work can work part-time on campus and the rest off campus.  </li>
<li>Security and preservation of University facilities and equipment - As such, the Department of Public Safety, some areas of Facilities &amp; Operations and some areas of Housing are examples of essential/critical functions and staff who may need to report to work.  </li>
</ul>
<p style="margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in">The directive is to have only employees on the campus who really must be on campus in order to deliver critical services.  Remote work should continue whenever possible during this pandemic situation.</p>
<p style="margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in">If you have any questions related to which employees must be on campus, please talk with your Vice Chancellor and/or University Human Resources. </p>

<p style="margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in">Yes. According to the CDC, employees who have symptoms of acute respiratory illness are recommended to stay home and not come to work until they are free of fever (100.4° F [37.8° C] or greater using an oral thermometer), signs of a fever, and any other symptoms for at least 24 hours, without the use of fever-reducing or other symptom-altering medicines (e.g. cough suppressants). Employees need to follow normal department protocol for absences from work (e.g. notifying your supervisor). </p>
<h6 style="margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in">What steps should be taken if an employee becomes ill with fever, cough, or other concerning symptoms?</h6>
<p style="margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in">CDC recommends that employees who appear to have acute respiratory illness symptoms (i.e. cough, shortness of breath) upon arrival to work or become sick during the day should be separated from other employees and be sent home immediately. </p>
<h6 style="margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in">Should employees with respiratory symptoms seek medical care?</h6>
<p style="margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in">Employees with respiratory symptoms should seek medical care right away. Before you go to a doctor’s office or emergency department, call ahead and tell them about your recent travel and your symptoms. </p>
<h6 style="margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in">What if an employee has a chronic health condition that could be directly impacted by the COVID-19 virus?</h6>
<p style="margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in">The Human Resources Office can assist members of the UM-Flint Campus who have chronic medical conditions that could be directly impacted by the COVID-19 virus, with their work accommodations. The process includes the employee providing a medical statement and authorization release form to the Office of Human Resources, attention to Benefits Coordinator, Suzi Bye. Contact Suzi Bye at <a href="mailto:sbye@umich.edu" style="color:blue" target="_blank">sbye@umich.edu</a> or by phone at 810-766-6658 if you have any questions.  <strong>   </strong></p>

            <div class="field field-name-field-body-text field-type-text-long field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item even"><h6><strong>What is the CARES act and how will funds be distributed?</strong></h6>
<div>The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act created the Higher Education Emergency Relief Fund (HEERF) to provide emergency grants to students. Qualifying students must be Title IV aid eligible and meet all qualifications of Section 484 of the Higher Education Act. Awards are being provided to qualifying students with an Expected Family Contribution of 20,000 or less as determined by the 2019-20 FAFSA. Additionally, students must have been enrolled and eligible as of 3/13/2020, the date the national pandemic emergency was declared.</p>
<p>	Funds received from the emergency grant are to help offset student costs associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. Such costs may include but are not limited to food, internet, software, phone, and supplies. Supplies should be associated with a student's ability to study and complete coursework remotely while they are enrolled in classes at UM-Flint due to Michigan’s current Stay At Home Executive Order issued by Governor Gretchen Whitmer. Eligible students will receive either a $500 or $750 grant, based on their enrollment in winter and spring 2020.</p>
<p>	The CARES Act requires institutions of higher education to release these funds directly to eligible students, regardless of any balance that may exist on a tuition account. Therefore, students will receive these funds in the near future either by check from UM-Flint (address on file) or direct deposit if they currently have that method set up through the Student Account Center portal.</div>
<div>

<h6>How do I get my federal stimulus check?</h6>
<p>A new website designed to make sure Michiganders receive their federal stimulus checks as soon as possible, was announced by the Poverty Solutions program. The 2020 Coronavirus Stimulus Payment website was developed by Poverty Solutions in partnership with Detroit-based nonprofit design firm Civilla. It walks people through a step-by-step process to ensure they've provided the IRS with the information necessary to receive their stimulus checks. Here is a link to the website: <a href="https://poverty.umich.edu/stimulus-checks/  ">https://poverty.umich.edu/stimulus-checks/  </a></p>
<h6>How can I apply for unemployment insurance?</h6>
<p>Expanded unemployment benefits are available to Michiganders affected by the coronavirus outbreak thanks to executive orders from Gov. Gretchen Whitmer and provisions of the federal Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act. </p>
<p>The temporary changes to unemployment insurance expand eligibility for unemployment benefits, extend the benefit period up to 39 weeks, provide an extra $600 per week for four months on top of Michigan’s unemployment payments, increase the application eligibility period from 14 to 28 days, and suspend the requirement to register in person and continue searching for work. </p>
<p>To be eligible for unemployment benefits, you must have worked in recent months and meet certain wage requirements. In Michigan, workers must file their unemployment claim within 28 days of their last day worked.</p>

<h6>What are other food-assistance benefits?</h6>
<p>The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program provides food assistance to individuals and families with low incomes. In response to the coronavirus pandemic, as of March 27, Michigan increased all SNAP recipients to the maximum benefit amount for March and April and waived the federal work requirement for able-bodied adults without dependents who receive SNAP. </p>
<p>People can apply for SNAP benefits through <a href="http://www.michigan.gov/mibridges">MI Bridges</a> or by contacting a consumer service representative toll-free at 888-678-8914. </p>
<h6>How can I access utility and housing assistance, internet access, and more?</h6>
<p><strong>Utilities</strong>: DTE Energy and Consumers Energy announced on March 16 they will suspend electricity and natural gas shutoffs or people with low incomes and senior citizens during the coronavirus pandemic. DTE customers impacted by COVID-19 — those with a sudden loss of income or medical condition — as well as vulnerable seniors can call 800-477-4747 to determine eligibility for payment assistance. Consumers customers affected by COVID-19 can call 800-477-5050. </p>
<p><strong>Water</strong>: Gov. Whitmer issued an executive order that requires public water suppliers in Michigan to immediately identify residences in their service area that do not currently have water service and to restore service to homes where the service has been disconnected due to non-payment or damaged infrastructure by April 12. Everyone in the state is eligible for water restoration, regardless of past-due water bills.</p>
<p>Contact your water supplier if you need your water service restored. </p>
<p><strong>Internet access</strong>: The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has asked broadband and telephone companies to take the Keep Americans Connected Pledge, which says they will not terminate service to any residential or small business customers because of their inability to pay their bills due to the disruptions caused by the coronavirus pandemic, will waive any late fees that any residential or small business customers incur because of their economic circumstances related to the coronavirus pandemic; and will open their Wi-Fi hotspots to any American who needs them.</p>
<p>Contact your service provider if you anticipate trouble paying your bill. </p>
<p>For more information, see this <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1F4zt5x8E6LrGunXCTItt4EUSk8iaooC9bhurHLl3QTA/edit">crowd-sourced list of free and low-cost internet options</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Evictions</strong>: Michigan is prohibiting evictions from residential properties, including mobile homes, during the coronavirus pandemic. Residents do not need to take any action in order to avoid eviction. Tenants are still responsible for rent owed.</p>
<p><strong>Tax Foreclosure</strong>: Michigan has temporarily postponed the tax foreclosure deadline for all residents. The deadline to pay back taxes and avoid foreclosure is extended from March 31 to May 29 or 30 days after the expiration of the coronavirus-related state of emergency, whichever comes first. </p>
<p><strong>Mortgage forbearance and moratorium on foreclosures and evictions</strong>: The federal CARES Act allows borrowers with federally-backed residential mortgages to defer payments for 180 days, with the option to request another 180 days of forbearance. Federally-backed mortgages include mortgages insured by the Federal Housing Administration, purchased by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, and insured or guaranteed by other federal departments.</p>

<p><strong>Childcare</strong>: Michigan’s Department of Licensing and Regulatory Affairs (LARA) is giving more provisional licenses and expanding capacity for child care services. Now, hospitals, public and non-public schools, and licensed in-home child care provider facilities can be used to provide disaster relief child care for members of the essential workforce. </p>
