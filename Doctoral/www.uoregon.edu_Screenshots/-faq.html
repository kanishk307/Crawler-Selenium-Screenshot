Though not confirmed by a positive diagnostic test, presumptive cases have a high likelihood of having COVID-19 because of the specific nature of the symptoms and known exposure.</p><h3>What are the symptoms of COVID-19?</h3><p>Patients with COVID-19 have reported mild to severe respiratory illness with symptoms including fever, cough, and shortness of breath. Symptoms may appear 2–14 days after exposure.</p><p>Information suggests that older people and those with certain underlying health conditions like heart disease, lung disease, and diabetes, for example, seem to be at greater risk of serious illness.</p><h3>How does COVID-19 spread?</h3><p>COVID-19 is thought to spread mainly from person-to-person. This includes being within approximately six feet of an individual with COVID-19 for a prolonged period of time and through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes.</p><p>It may also be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it, then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes.</p><h3>What should I do if I suspect I have COVID-19?</h3><p>If you develop these symptoms and have been in close contact with a person known to have COVID-19 or have recently traveled from an area with widespread or ongoing community spread of COVID-19, call your healthcare provider before going in person. Tell them about your recent travel or contact. They will work with the local or state public health departments to determine if you need to be tested for COVID-19.</p><p>Students in Eugene can call the <a href="https://health.uoregon.edu/covid19">University Health Center</a> at <a href="tel:541-346-2770">541-346-2770</a>. Students at the Portland campus can use the Portland State University <a href="https://www.pdx.edu/health-counseling/uo-portland">Center for Student Health and Counseling</a>, and OIMB students are encouraged to contact the <a href="http://bayclinic.net/">Bay Clinic</a> in Coos Bay.</p><p>If you are sick, follow all <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/about/steps-when-sick.html">CDC guidelines</a> to prevent the disease from spreading to people in your home and community.</p><p>If you are a UO employee, follow these <a href="//www.uoregon.edu/coronavirus-guidance">guidelines for employees</a>.</p><p>Individuals who wish to monitor themselves for symptoms can use a <a href="//www.uoregon.edu/sites/www2.uoregon.edu/files/self-monitoring.pdf">self-monitoring form</a> to do so.</p><h3>How is the UO planning for the possibility of a student, staff, or faculty member testing positive for COVID-19?</h3><p>The UO has a COVID Case Management Team that has developed protocols for isolation, cleaning, accommodation, and notification.</p><p>Team members from the University Health Center and Human Resources will work closely with local public health authorities on case management and specific recommendations based on the unique needs of every case. For student cases, the UO team may assist Lane County Public Health with contact tracing.</p><p>As we look toward having more people returning to campus in the fall, the team is working to ensure that the protocols can address an increase in potential caseloads.</p><h3>What is social distancing?</h3><p>Public health officials are encouraging persons to practice social distancing whenever possible. Social distancing includes maintaining distance from others when possible (6 feet is recommended), refraining from attending large gatherings or events, and avoiding unnecessary contact with others (e.g., not shaking hands, hugging, or kissing as greetings).</p><p>The University of Oregon has implemented social distancing strategies by providing remote education for spring and summer terms, canceling nonessential events/gatherings of 25 or more persons, and suspending certain travel. Individuals can practice similar strategies in their personal lives.</p><p>Additional guidance for social distancing in the workplace is available from <a href="https://hr.uoregon.edu/programs-services/covid-19-resources/covid-19-tips-distancing-workplace">Human Resources</a>.</p><h3>When is isolation or quarantine used?</h3><ul><li><strong><em>Isolation</em></strong> separates sick people with a contagious disease from people who are not sick.</li><li><strong><em>Quarantine</em></strong> separates and restricts the movement of people who were exposed to a contagious disease to see if they become sick.</li></ul><p>According to the CDC, both of these strategies are used to limit the spread of communicable disease.</p><p>Persons in isolation or quarantine should restrict activities outside their residence, except for getting medical care, for the period of time they are at risk of secondary transmission. If you are in isolation, do not go to work, school, or public areas, and avoid using public transportation, ride-sharing, or taxis.</p><p>If a student in UO housing needs isolation or quarantine, representatives of the Incident Management Team would work closely with health professionals to determine, on a case-by-case basis, a recommended housing option and isolation plan.</p><p>If someone around you has been placed in isolation or quarantine, this does not necessarily mean they have contracted COVID-19. They may simply be awaiting test results. Persons who have completed quarantine or have been released from isolation do not pose a risk of infection to other people.</p><h3>Where can undergraduate and graduate students find information about food insecurity?</h3><p>The Office of the Dean of Students provides updated information about food available on campus and in the Eugene-Springfield area at <a href="https://dos.uoregon.edu/food">dos.uoregon.edu/food</a>.</p><h3>I’m very worried about COVID-19 and I need help managing my feelings.</h3><p>The abundance of news and updates about COVID-19 is making many people feel anxious.

In the first phase, University Housing and the University Health Center partnered with UO researchers to offer COVID-19 testing to students living in university housing during the Spring term. Later phases could include testing for staff, faculty, and the broader community.</p><h3>What will the UO do with the data from the COVID-19 MAP study?</h3><p>The data will be used to help local, state, and federal health officials combat COVID-19 more effectively, predict the spread of the disease more accurately, inform containment and mitigation strategies for specific communities, allocate resources to locations that need them most, and evaluate the effectiveness of enacted strategies.</p><p>The data will also help inform the UO decisions on re-opening campus and easing of restrictions on physical distancing.</p><h3>Is the UO offering free COVID-19 testing to students?</h3><p>Yes. Starting in May, University Housing and the University Health Center are partnering with UO researchers to offer free COVID-19 testing to students currently living in residence halls on campus. This first phase of testing, approved by the UO’s Institutional Review Board, is being carried out to help the UO understand the potential spread of COVID-19 on campus and to prepare for expanding the UO’s testing and contact tracing capabilities in the future. Participation in the research is voluntary and confidential.</p><h3>Is the UO offering free COVID-19 testing to staff and faculty?</h3><p>Not at this time. We are at the beginning stages of the first phase of testing. The UO’s Institutional Review Board has approved the research for voluntary testing of students currently living on campus. This testing study will help us understand the potential spread of COVID-19 on campus and allow us to prepare for expanding the UO’s testing and contact tracing capabilities in the future.</p><h3>What happens if someone on campus tests positive in the study?</h3><p>Students will be informed of their test results by the University Health Center.</p><p>If the diagnostic test result is positive, the university will work to support the student and will implement case management protocols already developed for management of a positive case on campus. This includes rigorous contact tracing of any positive results to reduce the spread of COVID-19 on campus and in the community.</p><p>We will follow federal and state guidance with respect to reporting results from diagnostic testing to local, state, and federal health authorities.</p><p><em>Section last updated June 26, 2020, at 11:37 a.m.</em></p><h4><a href="#top">Return to Top ⇧</a></h4><hr /><h2><a id="prevention" name="prevention"></a>Prevention</h2><h3>What can I do to avoid getting sick?</h3><p>The best way to prevent the spread of respiratory illnesses, including COVID-19 and influenza, is to avoid exposure to the virus.</p><p>Take the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/about/prevention-treatment.html">CDC-recommended precautions</a> to reduce your risk of exposure, including <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/handwashing/">proper handwashing</a>; avoiding touching your eyes, nose, and mouth; covering your cough or sneeze with a tissue, then throwing the tissue in a trash receptacle; cleaning and disinfecting frequently touched objects and surfaces; and avoiding close contact with people who are sick.</p><p>The university has deployed a number of <a href="https://map.uoregon.edu/hand-wash">handwashing stations across campus</a>.</p><h3>How should I clean my workspace?</h3><p>The CDC and University Health Center recommend people clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces (e.g., keyboards, cell phones, doorknobs, desks, light switches) using a regular household cleaning spray or wipe.</p><p>An <a href="https://www.epa.gov/pesticide-registration/selected-epa-registered-disinfectants">EPA-registered disinfectant</a> or 10 percent bleach/water solution will be most effective.

The plan is based on a shared commitment among the universities for a common planning approach, shared operating principles, and consistent adherence to shared criteria, applied independently to local context.</p><p>The other universities are Oregon State University, Southern Oregon University, the Oregon Institute of Technology, Portland State University, Eastern Oregon University, and Western Oregon University.</p><h3>What are the three phases of reopening campus?</h3><p>The phases are based on the current status of COVID-19 in the university’s three locations. Each phase leads to an easing of restrictions.</p><p>For example, we are currently offering remote instruction only. But as local health care conditions improve, the number of cases falls, and testing and contact tracing increase, we plan to adopt an approach that combines remote and in-person instruction. That will include limiting lectures to 50 people with physical distancing and enhanced cleaning of class spaces. Classes with more than 50 people will be remote only or hybrid, with lectures delivered online and smaller discussion sessions in person.</p><p>As conditions further improve, we may be able to incrementally increase in-person class size up to 250 people, but we would not make a change like that mid-term. We have developed phased scenarios for every kind of university activity.</p><p>We are also developing contingency plans should the university need to return to a fully remote schedule if conditions worsen.</p><h3>When will fall term in-person instruction end?</h3><p>We anticipate ending in-person classes after Week 9, just before Thanksgiving. Week 10 and finals week will be fully remote. This will allow students the option of leaving the campus for the holiday and not having to return for the remainder of the calendar year, thereby reducing travel expenses and allowing students to avoid extra time on planes, buses, and trains. Residence halls and dining options will be open throughout this period for those who need them.</p><h3>What steps will the UO take for residence halls to facilitate physical distancing and other safety precautions to prevent the spread of COVID-19?</h3><p>In coordination with other Oregon universities and with guidance from the Oregon Health Authority and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, we will implement reduced density in the residence halls. Physical distancing will be enforced throughout common areas and dining halls. </p><p>No students will live in triple rooms in our residence halls. We are reducing density and making plans for extra cleaning, particularly in shared bathrooms. We are also setting aside entire sections of our residence halls for isolation should they be needed.  Please continue to check back at the <a href="https://housing.uoregon.edu/">UO’s Housing website</a> for the latest information.</p><p>Dining halls will be open for students, but with limited seating. They will operate under all appropriate restaurant safety guidelines from local health authorities.</p><h3>How will you maintain physical distancing in large lecture halls and students traveling to and from classes?</h3><p>We are currently planning for all classes over 50 students to be remote. We are considering having smaller in-person discussion sections associated with those classes.</p><p>We are also resetting maximum capacities in class spaces and increasing transition times between classes to account for physical distancing. We are planning on a transition time of 30 minutes between uses of all class space to allow for sanitizing and distancing. Because of that additional transition time, we anticipate that we will have classes scheduled over a longer period of the day.</p><p>It may be that some classes will not meet in-person for all of the originally scheduled time and will have to be supplemented with remote instruction.</p><p>More information will be made available as planning continues.</p><h3>For courses that will need to remain remote due to class size, what is the UO doing to ensure quality instruction and continued engagement for the students?</h3><p>For classes that will be entirely online, we are working hard to enhance the curriculum, interactivity, digital platform and overall student experience. If you take a fully-online class, we want it to be of the same quality that you would experience in-person. This year we will add at least 150 well-prepared online classes to our schedule.</p><p>We are providing ongoing instructional support to faculty through the provost’s Faculty and GE Support Team, as well as on the Office of the Provost's <a href="https://provost.uoregon.edu/academic-continuity-resources-and-guidance">Academic Continuity Resources and Guidance</a>, which is continuously updated with workshops, trainings, and technical help.</p><h3>I share an office space with several coworkers. How will the university apply distancing requirements in shared workspaces?</h3><p>We will be providing guidance for departments on recommended office densities, including guidance for single occupancy offices versus work spaces that are shared or in open spaces. In the coming weeks departments will be asked to develop phased office resumption plans.</p><h3>What options will be available to employees if schools or child care centers remain closed when the university begins to reopen?</h3><p>We will continue to provide remote and flexible work options while our community is impacted by COVID-19. We are also offering a temporary FMLA expansion for these purposes through December 31, 2020.</p><h3>What measures are in place to ensure water quality in campus buildings during the long periods of vacancy?</h3><p>Campus Planning and Facilities Management (CPFM) and Auxiliary Departments are maintaining staff presence within most of our buildings. <a href="https://safety.uoregon.edu/sites/safety1.uoregon.edu/files/campus_water_quality_notification_-_shortened_version_ss.pdf">Flushing of water systems</a> has been added to their daily work.
