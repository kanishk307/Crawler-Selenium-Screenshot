Making this decision now should allow our faculty valuable time to plan online instruction for existing courses and consider new offerings, and allow our students more time to consider what they can achieve during what will likely be a quieter-than-normal summer. This was a difficult decision to make, but we feel it is necessary to ensure that we don&#8217;t let our guard down too soon and take steps backward as a result. While we will miss the flurry of activity that is commonplace on our campus in the summer months, we take these steps with an eye toward August when we can hopefully welcome our students back to campus with open arms.<br/>&#160;<br/>Priority registration for summer programs has been available since November and remains open through May 5, 2020.&#160; Summer registration will reopen on May 28, 2020 and remain open through June 3, 2020.&#160; As is always the case, registration can be completed through the <a href="https://my.belmont.edu">myBelmont</a> portal at any time.&#160;Please check <a href="http://classfinder.belmont.edu" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Belmont Classfinder</a> frequently as faculty will be creating new courses around this anticipated opportunity, allowing current students more time to consider what they can achieve during what will likely be a quieter-than-normal summer.</p></accordion-content></div><li class="acc-toggle "><p class="label">New</p>What will happen to Towering Traditions, Belmont's summer orientation for new students?<span class="icon-plus"></span></li><div class="acc-content" style="display: none;"><accordion-content><p>Due to COVID-19 safety precautions,&#160;Belmont University&#160;has made the difficult decision to transition&#160;Summer Orientation to an&#160;online orientation and registration&#160;experience. Currently,&#160;all Move-In Day and Welcome Week events in August&#160;will move forward&#160;as planned.&#160;While we know our future&#160;Bruins&#160;and their families looked forward to an on-campus&#160;Summer Orientation&#160;experience, please rest assured&#160;we are here to help you be ready for your first day of courses at Belmont&#160;in August!

This includes Belmont athletics, academic and music camps as well as outside organizations like M-Fuge who use our campus to conduct their camps. We look forward to hosting these events again in the future.</p></accordion-content></div></ul><div class="text-widget"><mainText><hr/>
<h2>Overview/General</h2></mainText></div><ul class="acc"><li class="acc-toggle "><p class="label"></p>Why is Belmont Making These Schedule Adjustments?<span class="icon-plus"></span></li><div class="acc-content" style="display: none;"><accordion-content><p>The rapid spread and still-unknown threat of the Coronavirus and COVID-19 find us in the middle of uncertain and extraordinary times. Having considered all available information and in following guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and local/state health department officials, Belmont is electing to act with an abundance of caution with three main goals driving our decisions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Caring for the health of our students, faculty and staff</li>
<li>Preventing the virus from infiltrating our campus</li>
<li>Contributing to public health efforts to stem the spread of this virus throughout our community</li>
</ul>
<p>In our view, these extraordinary circumstances call for extraordinary (and, at least at Belmont, unprecedented) actions. Across the country announcements are being made of closures, cancellations, postponements, and other disruptions to plans and life. Each of these disruptions are bound to cause an array of frustrations, inconveniences and sacrifices, all in the name of helping to curb this public health crisis. We are fully aware that Belmont&#8217;s own changes will have similar effect on our students and their families; we ask your patience and understanding as we venture through this together.</p>
<p><em><u>Please take note</u></em>:&#160;Given&#160;the evolving nature of this COVID-19 situation, Belmont has made the decision&#160;to move all courses online for the remainder of the Spring&#160;and Summer 2020 terms. We&#160;recognize this raises many questions, and University administrators are working&#160;diligently to manage all the details this transition requires. We ask&#160;for your&#160;patience and understanding. More information will be communicated soon and&#160;please check this site often for updates as well to Frequently Asked&#160;Questions.</p></accordion-content></div><li class="acc-toggle "><p class="label">Updated</p>What Changes are Being Made to the Spring Schedule?<span class="icon-plus"></span></li><div class="acc-content" style="display: none;"><accordion-content><p>Belmont administrators have been closely studying the collective efforts being made to flatten the curve of coronavirus cases across the United States. Unfortunately, it has become clear that those efforts are not working quickly enough and may not start taking significant effect for several more weeks. Given the potential for exposure and CDC recommendations for social distancing, Belmont has made the following decisions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Belmont will be moving to a remote learning model for all students through the conclusion of the summer term, including final exams.</li>
<li>Commencement ceremonies currently scheduled for May 2 will be rescheduled for August 7. All graduating seniors will be invited to participate in what will be a special ceremony for our Spring 2020 graduating class on that date.&#160;&#160;Graduates will not be required to attend the August commencement event, but we promise to make it a special celebration for you and your family. Regardless, your official graduation date will not be delayed, and your diplomas will be delivered. More details will be made available soon.</li>
<li>All in-person, organized group activities on campus through at least May 2 are canceled. This includes the Best of the Best Showcase, President&#8217;s Concert, visual or performing arts events, O&#8217;More Fashion Show, athletic competitions, Scholarship and Awards Day, Be Belmont Day and any other events that require large gatherings of people. In addition, summer courses and summer orientation sessions will be conducted virtually, and all summer campus (including athletic, academic and music camps) will be cancelled.</li>
<li>In order to catch up on lost class time, Easter Break will be canceled, and remote instruction will continue on April 9, 10 and 13. While we understand the potential impact to some in our community, given the circumstances, it was deemed necessary to cancel Easter Break to add those three&#160;days (April 9-10 and 13) back to the academic calendar. We ask that all students make every effort possible to participate as needed in their remote classes on those&#160;days despite the frustrations and inconveniences that come with this schedule change. Please know that we are asking the same of our faculty and staff. If your&#160;specific circumstances are extraordinary in nature, please work with your professors to determine if accommodations can be granted.&#160;</li>
<li>All Residence Halls will cease having student card access Sunday, March 22. Students will need to arrange a time with their Residence Director to pick up their belongings. To minimize stress on our families, the deadline for being moved completely out of residence halls is not until May 31. Residence Life has emailed all residential students with details of a safe and orderly process for scheduling move out. Additional details can be found on Res Life&#8217;s FAQ page.</li>
<li>All international and domestic Maymester study abroad programs and May mission trips as well as summer study abroad/study away programs and mission trips have already been canceled, and impacted students and faculty have been notified.</li>
<li>Belmont is offering prorated room and board refunds as a result of these changes. Please visit the <a href="http://www.belmont.edu/health-services/coronavirus/faq-refund.html">Refund FAQ page</a> for more details.</li>

In addition, we have, as required by SACSCOC, notified them that we are temporarily moving all of our face-to-face on-campus instruction to online instruction.</p></accordion-content></div><li class="acc-toggle "><p class="label">New</p>How is Belmont instituting the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act?<span class="icon-plus"></span></li><div class="acc-content" style="display: none;"><accordion-content><p>On April 9, 2020, the Department of Education (DOE) issued a letter to all University Presidents announcing plans to distribute funds to higher education institutions as part of the Federal CARES (Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security) Act.&#160;A portion of these funds are&#160;earmarked to issue emergency aid grants directly to students to offset financial burdens brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic.&#160;The amount of funds received by each institution was calculated based on the percentage of Pell-eligible students enrolled.</p>
<p>DOE guidelines for distributing these emergency grants are clear in asking&#160;each institution&#160;to place priority on&#160;students with the greatest need. Using the Expected Family Contribution (EFC, as captured by the FAFSA) as a means to determine qualifying students, Belmont will be distributing $1,000 emergency grants to more than 2,000 students.&#160;Students meeting this criteria have already been notified by Student Financial Services that they will receive the emergency aid, and the grants will be issued&#160;directly to those students&#160;as soon as the DOE delivers the funds to Belmont.</p>
<p>While only some of our students qualified to receive this emergency aid, every student is important to Belmont. We empathize with the individual challenges&#160;and&#160;setbacks&#160;being lived out across our entire student body. To any students who did not fall under the need criteria as outlined above but are experiencing significant financial hardship related to the COVID-19 crisis, please contact Student Financial Services to discuss your circumstances and see if we can help. This dedicated team can be reached at 615.460.6403, or at <a href="mailto:caresgrants@belmont.edu">caresgrants@belmont.edu</a>. We ask for your patience as this team works to respond to and help as many students as possible.</p>

<h2>Academics &amp; WELL Core</h2></mainText></div><ul class="acc"><li class="acc-toggle "><p class="label">New</p>Will Belmont implement a Pass/Fail option for Spring Semester courses?<span class="icon-plus"></span></li><div class="acc-content" style="display: none;"><accordion-content><p>The reality of the coronavirus epidemic continues to significantly impact our lives, including how faculty approach teaching and supporting students as well as how students have had adapt to new learning methods while also coping the personal impact.</p>
<p>While up until this time Belmont has not modified its approach to grading for the semester, please know it is not due to lack of awareness of or empathy for these realities. Rather, it is because we have been considering solutions that take all relevant factors into account. A move to pass/fail, while being adopted widely among other Universities, is not necessarily the best option for every student. Such a move also affects things like how other colleges/universities view your transcripts (transfer credit, graduate/professional school admissions, etc.), grade point average calculations (which could impact financial aid, graduate/professional school admission, employment opportunities, etc.), academic progress, professional certifications,&#160; etc.&#160;</p>
<p>It is for these reasons that Belmont is implementing an approach that provides students the option to elect a pass/fail approach for a portion of their courses. Details are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Each student is allowed to select up to seven (7) credit hours as Pass/Fail <strong>AFTER</strong> grades have been posted for the spring 2020 term.</li>
<li>This allows students to pursue their best graded outcome to the benefit of their overall academic performance, while also providing an option for those courses where the graded outcome was lower than expected.</li>
<li>This is a one-time only exception to the University&#8217;s standard grading policies resulting from the aforementioned circumstances.</li>
</ul>
<p>Additional information to assist students in deciding whether/how to exercise the pass/fail option can be found <a href="../../../provost/pass-fail-faq/index.html">here</a>.</p></accordion-content></div><li class="acc-toggle "><p class="label">Updated</p>What steps is Belmont implementing to ensure academic progress is not impacted?<span class="icon-plus"></span></li><div class="acc-content" style="display: none;"><accordion-content><p>The extension of Spring Break &#8211; necessary to prepare for the planned resumption of academic work on March 23 &#8211; will cause us to lose five days on the original academic calendar. We expect to make up most of that time with the three days gained through the cancellation of Easter Break. The resulting difference &#8211; two days &#8211; is within typical standard of variation allowed for snow/weather-related or other class cancellations.</p>
<p>Online classes resume on March 23 for the rest of the spring semester as well as the Maymester/summer term. Our faculty are working diligently to ensure an outcome consistent with existing levels of in-class instruction. Students should expect the same high-quality academic offering and experience, delivered by the same dedicated, highly-capable faculty, but delivered via innovative and collaborative online platforms. Information will be sent to students providing details for their specific courses.</p>
<p>Because we do not expect this to impact academic quality or progress toward completion of degrees, no tuition refunds are being offered based on these changes.</p>

<p>Due to ongoing concerns surrounding the coronavirus and in an effort to do our part to control the spread of COVID-19, Belmont University announced March 18 the difficult decision to close all residence halls on campus for the few students who had remained on campus during Spring Break. Those individuals must be out of their rooms no later than 5 p.m. on Sunday, March 22. Prior exceptions are no longer valid, and all students need to make arrangements to move home.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>After 5 p.m. March 22, card access to the buildings will cease, and students will need to coordinate with their facility&#8217;s Residence Director to access any needed items from their rooms. To minimize stress on our families, the deadline for being moved completely out of residence halls is not until May 31.&#160;Residence Life has emailed all residential students with details of a safe and orderly process for scheduling move out. Additional details can be found on <a href="../../../_archive/res-life-old/COVID19ResLifeFAQs.html">Res Life&#8217;s FAQ</a>&#160;page.</p>
