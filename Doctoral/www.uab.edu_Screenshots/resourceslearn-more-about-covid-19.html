<p>Human coronaviruses are the second most common cause of colds and generally cause mild to moderate symptoms. Sometimes, coronaviruses that infect animals can evolve and become a new human coronavirus, as in the case of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in 2003, or the novel coronavirus, COVID-19, which first appeared in late 2019.</p>
<p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is closely monitoring an outbreak of respiratory illness caused by COVID-19, which was first identified in China. According to the CDC, the complete clinical picture with regard to COVID-19 is not fully understood.</p>
<p>UAB — along with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Alabama Department of Public Health — are closely monitoring the ongoing situation. COVID-19 can cause mild illness that can be overcome, but more severe cases can be life-threatening. More information about the 2019 novel coronavirus is available on the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/summary.html?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fcoronavirus%2F2019-ncov%2Fsummary.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CDC website</a>.</p>
<p><strong>If you are experiencing symptoms, call your primary care physician or urgent care facility first. For the latest COVID-19 information from the Alabama Department of Public Health, call 1-800-338-8374.</strong></p>
<p>With a growing number of confirmed COVID-19 (novel coronavirus) cases in the United States, feeling sick can be scary. But the best thing to do if you feel ill is to stay calm and contact your doctor. If you have symptoms like cough, fever or other respiratory problems, contact your doctor before coming to a clinic or hospital. Please do not go to the emergency room. Emergency rooms need to be able to serve those with the most critical needs. If you are having a medical emergency, call 911.</p>

    <h3 class="uk-accordion-title">What if someone is diagnosed? How will I know if I was in contact?</h3>

    <div class="uk-accordion-content">

        
        
        
                <div class="uk-margin"><p>
Alabama and Jefferson County are experiencing community spread of COVID-19. UAB has taken proactive steps to fight the pandemic (e.g., online/alternative classes, limited business operations, aggressive social distancing), but we expect people to have questions about how they may be notified if they were in contact with someone who tested positive as testing increases in Birmingham. Based on requirements regarding student, employee and patient privacy, we are limited in what health information can be shared, but UAB works closely with the Alabama Department of Public Health.</p>
 <p>
The health department gathers and provides verified tests, contacts the case, determines the contacts at risk, and notifies them of what to do. If an individual is determined to have been in close contact with someone who has been diagnosed, ADPH – or an official designee (which could be UAB Student or Employee Health) – will contact that individual to discuss next steps.</p><p>
 
ADPH clarified the law and process: COVID-19 is a notifiable disease by law in Alabama. This means that all labs are required to report positive tests for COVID-19 to public health within 4 hours of results. Once the health department receives notification of a positive result, the health department – or an official designee (which could be UAB Student or Employee Health) – will contact the person who tested positive and begin determining who around the person might have been exposed.</p>

    COVID-19 is a new coronavirus that has been identified as the cause of an outbreak of respiratory illness first detected in China. It is spread from person to person, causing mild to severe respiratory illnesses. Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that often cause respiratory tract infections. Common human coronaviruses cause upper respiratory tract infections with symptoms of the common cold. Occasionally, human coronaviruses can cause lower respiratory tract infections, like pneumonia. Two other human coronaviruses, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, may cause severe infections.

    The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fever</li>
<li>Cough</li>
<li>Shortness of breath</li>
</ul>
<p>If you have been exposed to someone with laboratory confirmed COVID-19 and are experiencing fever with either cough or shortness of breath, you might have COVID-19. You should call your primary care physician or urgent care facility first to see if you need to be tested.

<ul>
<li>Stay home except to get medical care</li>
<li>Separate yourself from other people and animals in your home</li>
<li>Call ahead before visiting your doctor</li>
<li>Wear a face mask when you are around other people</li>
<li>Cover your coughs and sneezes</li>
<li><a href="https://youtu.be/cViNneQbPyA">Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds or use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer</a></li>
<li>Avoid sharing personal household items like dishes, cups, towels and bedding</li>
<li>Clean all “high-touch” surfaces every day with a household cleaning spray or wipe</li>
<li>Monitor your symptoms and let your healthcare provider know you are experiencing symptoms that may be related to COVID-19</li>
<li>If you are told to go to the doctor’s office, wear a face mask before entering the facility</li>
</ul>

<p>If you get sick with fever, cough or shortness of breath (even if your symptoms are very mild), you likely have COVID-19. You should isolate yourself at home and away from other people. If you have any of the following conditions that may increase your risk for a serious infection—age 60 years or older, are pregnant, or have medical conditions—contact your physician’s office and tell them that you were exposed to someone with COVID-19. They may want to monitor your health more closely or test you for COVID-19.
</p><p>If you do not have a high-risk condition but want medical advice, call your healthcare provider and tell them you were exposed to someone with COVID-19. Your healthcare provider can help you decide if you need to be evaluated in person. There are currently no medications to treat COVID-19.</p><p>
If you have a medical emergency and need to call 911, notify the dispatch personnel that you may have been exposed to COVID-19. If possible, put on a facemask before emergency medical services arrive or immediately after they arrive.

    COVID-19 is spread from person to person through coughing or sneezing. Virus-carrying airborne droplets can remain in the air or on surfaces even after the ill person is no longer near.
</p>
<p>
    Dr. Ellen Eaton, M.D., assistant professor in the Division of Infectious Diseases at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, says that social gatherings of any type with anyone other than your immediate family are no longer safe for the community.

</p>
<ul>
<li>Living in the same household as a sick person with COVID-19,</li>
<li>Caring for a sick person with COVID-19,</li>
<li>Being within 6 feet of a sick person with COVID-19 for about 10 minutes, OR</li>
<li>Being in direct contact with secretions from a sick person with COVID-19 (e.g., being coughed on, kissing, sharing utensils, etc.).</li>
</ul>
<p>
    
If you have not been in close contact with a sick person with COVID-19, you are at low risk for infection. </p>

                <div class="uk-margin"><ul>
<li>Now is the time to disinfect and clean your home. Use isopropyl alcohol, or disinfecting wipes, to wipe down countertops and common areas.</li>
<li>Keep the surfaces of your home clean, especially areas where you eat and spend the most time. <a href="https://youtu.be/cViNneQbPyA">Use soap and water to wash your hands after you touch contaminated areas</a>, such as doorknobs, toilet and faucet handles, and any cooking items. If you do not have access to soap and water, use hand sanitizer.</li>
<li>Avoid shaking hands with others right now. If you do, <a href="https://youtu.be/cViNneQbPyA">wash your hands</a> or use sanitizer right away, especially before touching your face.</li>
<li>Limit the amount of time spent in public places and avoid people who are sick, including those who are coughing or presenting symptoms. </li><li>If you have a fever or other symptoms, stay home. If your children have a fever, do not send them to school. Consider working from home if your workplace allows it.</li>
<li>Plan ahead for your daily medications. Be sure that you have plenty of the medicines that you routinely take so that if you become ill you can avoid going out in public to retrieve these things. In the case of a pandemic or major outbreak in the United States, it is a good idea to stock up on non-perishable foods should your community be quarantined.</li>
<li>Currently, we are still in peak influenza season. If you have not received a flu shot, it is not too late. For more information and guidance about common flu symptoms and treatment, please visit uab.edu/flu.

                <div class="uk-margin"><ul>
<li>UAB experts encourage you to make sure your hands are as clean as possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/cViNneQbPyA">Wash your hands as much as you can</a>, especially before you eat anything, before making food for other people and after you use the restroom. Wash your hands anytime you touch a doorknob, or any other items touched by others; if there is hand sanitizer around, use it.</li>
<li>Lather your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds — this is the length of time it takes to sing ‘Happy Birthday’ to yourself twice.</li>
<li>Be cautious of touching your face. Every time you touch a door handle and then scratch your nose, you are susceptible to contracting viruses.</li>

    With COVID-19 cases continuing to rise in the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, along with the National Institutes of Health, has encouraged all to do their part to halt the spread of new infections by “flattening the curve.”  </p><p>

“By flattening the curve, you’re essentially trying to challenge the health care system with the same number of cases but spread out over a longer period of time,” explained Jeanne Marrazzo, M.D., director of the University of Alabama at Birmingham Division of Infectious Diseases. “In slowing down the spread of disease by minimizing transmission opportunities through social distancing techniques, we aren’t overwhelming health systems as we are able to curb the spread of new infections.” </p><p>

    <h3 class="uk-accordion-title">How do I self-quarantine? How is that different than isolation?</h3>

    <div class="uk-accordion-content">

        
        
        
                <div class="uk-margin"><p>
    According to the <a href="https://www.hhs.gov/answers/public-health-and-safety/what-is-the-difference-between-isolation-and-quarantine/index.html">U.S. Department of Health and Human Services</a>: 
</p>
<ul>
<li>Isolation is used to separate ill persons who have a communicable disease from those who are healthy. Isolation restricts the movement of ill persons to help stop the spread of certain diseases. For example, hospitals use isolation for patients with infectious tuberculosis.</li>
<li>Quarantine is used to separate and restrict the movement of well persons who may have been exposed to a communicable disease to see if they become ill. These people may have been exposed to a disease and do not know it, or they may have the disease but do not show symptoms. Quarantine can also help limit the spread of communicable disease.</li>
</ul>
<p>
    
If an outbreak of COVID-19 occurs in a community or workplace, people may be asked to self-quarantine at home to prevent the spread of any disease. If a patient has a confirmed case of COVID-19, they will be put in isolation to avoid spreading to others directly.

    Federal privacy laws limit what information can be shared when it comes to health information, so UAB must defer to the Jefferson County Health Department and Alabama Department of Public Health to share the appropriate amount of information about the status of COVID-19 in Alabama (which they are already doing).&nbsp;
</p><p>

Health professionals at UAB are trained and equipped to safely isolate and care for patients with infectious diseases. If a positive case appeared in a particular location, the health department – in partnership with appropriate organizations – would coordinate the notification of those possibly affected in the interest of public health and safety.
