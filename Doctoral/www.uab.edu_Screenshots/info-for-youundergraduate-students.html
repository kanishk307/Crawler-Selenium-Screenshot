    <h3 class="uk-accordion-title"><span id="fallsemesterupdate">Fall Semester Update </span>Monday, June 22 at 3:30 p.m.</h3>

    <div class="uk-accordion-content">

        
        
        
                <div class="uk-margin"><p>
    UAB students,</p> 

<p>We’re looking forward to <a href="https://www.uab.edu/coronavirus/reentry/uab-united">uniting on campus again</a>. University and System leadership are in constant contact with infectious disease and public health experts as we plan for a safe return to campus. We will provide regular updates and greater detail about plans leading up to the <a href="https://www.uab.edu/coronavirus/reentry/student-re-entry">fall semester</a>. </p>
<p>
To stay informed, please read all emails from UAB, including Greenmail every Wednesday. You can also visit <a href="http://www.uab.edu/coronavirus">uab.edu/coronavirus</a> and <a href="http://www.uab.edu/reentry">uab.edu/reentry</a>, both of which have student-specific sections. </p>
<p>
Key COVID-19 safety strategies for the fall (detailed plans will be communicated):</p>
<ul>
<li>Students, faculty and staff will complete a COVID-19 safety training prior to reentry</li>
<li>Masks/face coverings and social distancing will be required and enforced </li>
<li>COVID-19 testing will be used strategically, informed by infectious disease experts </li>
<li>Use of UAB-developed symptom monitoring “health check” and exposure notification technology </li>
<li>Educational and instructional safety signage posted throughout campus</li>
<li>Extensive cleaning and disinfecting practices in place</li>
<li>Residence halls and other buildings will take special precautions </li>
<li>We will not return to in-person fall semester instruction after Thanksgiving Break; after the Thanksgiving Break there will be one week of remote/alternate instruction classes, and final exams will be taken remotely the following week (we plan to resume in-person classes for the spring semester in January 2021)</li>
<li>In the interest of safety, <a href="https://www.uab.edu/commencement/ceremony/summer">summer commencement</a> will be held virtually (graduates who wish to walk in a future in-person ceremony will have the opportunity to do so)</li>
<li>Guidance, health tips and updates will be communicated regularly</li>
</ul>
<p>
In addition, our hybrid instruction model will safely manage class sizes starting in the fall semester to promote social distancing. In most classes, students will rotate days in and out of the classroom with a combination of in-person and remote learning. Faculty (who will address class format in their syllabi) will provide in-person instruction to roughly 30-50 percent of students registered in a class while a camera system feeds real-time video to the remainder of the class remotely. The recording will also be available in Canvas for later viewing. Equipment has been secured to support the hybrid model and will be installed in time for the fall semester. </p>
<p>
Again, please check your email regularly and read Greenmail every Wednesday for important updates. If you have family members who would also like <a href="https://uab.tfaforms.net/217785">to receive Greenmail, sign up here</a>. 

</p>
<p>
In the meantime, please continue to be an example in our community by following important <a href="https://www.uab.edu/coronavirus/social-distancing">COVID-19 safety guidelines</a>. </p>

    <div class="uk-accordion-content">

        
        
        
                <div class="uk-margin"><p>
    Despite our nation's efforts to slowly reopen our cities and economies, COVID-19 continues to be a very real and serious threat to the health and safety of our community and will continue to be into the fall semester as well. As a result, it is vital for us to implement strict protocols and practices within the residence halls to continue to keep you and your families as safe as possible.</p>
<p>Please carefully review the changes outlined below. Additional information will be sent on a regular basis throughout the rest of the summer. </p>
<h3>
  IMPORTANT STUDENT HOUSING UPDATES FOR FALL 2020  
</h3>
<ul>
<li>All residence hall rooms, lobbies, lounges, and laundry rooms will be thoroughly cleaned, disinfected, and sanitized prior to opening for fall. Common area spaces (lobbies, lounges, laundry rooms, elevators) will be cleaned more frequently throughout the day during the year.</li>
<li>Residents will be required to complete an online COVID safety precaution training module and a contract addendum prior to arriving on campus to move in.</li>
<li>We anticipate that all residents – symptomatic or not – will be asked to be tested for COVID-19 before moving into the residence halls. More information will be provided as details and guidance are available.</li>
<li>Green Hall (our newest residence hall currently under construction) will not be completely open for operation until late Fall 2020; some students will have an opportunity to delay moving on campus until it is complete. If you would like to consider this option, please notify us at <span id="cloak120c42c9f205836f106ca6c3a1640ec2">This email address is being protected from spambots.

		</script>.</li>
    <li>Rast and Blount Halls have private bedrooms and will be fully occupied this fall. Because the common areas will be used by up to four people, residents in these halls will be required to clean and disinfect their apartments weekly.</li>
<li>Students who require any special accommodations must register with Disability Student Services to provide the required documentation for housing accommodation requests. If you have not already started this process, we encourage you to do so as soon as possible. For more information, go to <a href="http://www.uab.edu/dss">www.uab.edu/dss</a>.</li>
<li>Residents will only be allowed limited personal belongings in the halls this fall - more details will follow.</li>
<li>VISITORS WILL NOT BE ALLOWED IN ANY UAB RESIDENCE HALL FOR THE ENTIRE FALL SEMESTER.</li>
<li>In-hall gatherings will be very limited and prohibited for groups larger than ten (10) people.</li>
<li>Lounges and lobbies will be restricted to ten (10) people or less, and 6 feet of separation between individuals must be maintained.</li>
<li>Face masks will be required in common areas and wearing them will be enforced.</li>
<li>No more than two residents on an elevator at a time – riders will face opposite walls with face masks in place.</li>
<li>Residents must notify Student Health should they experience any symptoms related to COVID-19.</li>
<li>Residents must self-isolate if they have COVID-related symptoms. Apartments designated for quarantine and isolation will be made available; residents will be required to temporarily relocate to those spaces until symptoms subside and Student Health clears them to return to their assigned residence hall.</li>
<li>UAB plans to make exposure notification technology available to anonymously alert individuals of possible exposure to someone who has tested positive for COVID-19.  </li>
<li>Students will be required to complete a web-based health check assessment, and students may be asked to participate in voluntary, sentinel COVID-19 testing during the semester.</li>
</ul>

<h3>
    Information for Returning Residents
</h3>
<p>
    Students who wish to cancel their fall application may do so and will receive a full refund of all Fall 2020 housing application fees paid to date if we receive your request on or before July 1. A separate email will be sent with instructions upon your request. If you decide to cancel for the fall semester, we encourage you to consider returning to housing in the spring, as we hope to progress toward returning to more normal operation within Student Housing.

    UAB students, faculty and staff,</p>
 
<p>Our <a href="http://www.uab.edu/reentry">gradual re-entry to campus</a> continues and is going well, as is our planning with the University of Alabama System for a safe return this fall with a hybrid model – a course delivery system which, because of social distancing precautions, requires a combination of both in-person instruction and remote instruction. To promote the health and safety of the campus community, adjustments have been made to the fall semester schedule:</p>
 
<ul>
<li>Fall semester hybrid classes will start Monday, Aug. 24, 2020.</li>
<li>Fall semester hybrid classes will end Friday, Nov. 20, for the Thanksgiving break.</li>
<li>Students will not return to campus after Thanksgiving break. </li>
<li>Exceptions can be granted for students based on work, research or clinical responsibilities, and accommodations can be requested for international students or others who do not have alternate living arrangements.  </li>
<li>Classes during the week of Nov. 30-Dec. 4, as well as final exams during the week of Dec. 7-11, will be conducted remotely.<br>
<em>Coursework engagement during these weeks is necessary to accommodate <a href="https://sacscoc.org/accrediting-standards/">SACSCOC accrediting standard</a> requirements for credit granted for coursework. </em></li>
</ul>

<p>Additional information for our phased re-entry to campus (including details about on-campus housing, classroom protocols, personal protective equipment, and COVID-19 training and testing) continue to be worked out and will be communicated in the coming days and weeks. UAB’s e-newsletters are your source of official information. To stay informed of the latest news and updates, students are encouraged read Greenmail each Wednesday, and faculty and staff are encouraged to read eReporter each Tuesday and Friday. We will also continue to update <a href="https://www.uab.edu/coronavirus/">uab.edu/coronavirus</a> and <a href="http://www.uab.edu/reentry">uab.edu/reentry</a>. </p>

    UAB Students,</p>

<p>What you have done to fight through the stress and uncertainty that come with sudden change is a big accomplishment. <strong>We are proud that you are part of the Blazer family.</strong> </p>

<p>You’re an integral part of a health-promoting university where students champion <a href="https://www.uab.edu/blazerway/about">The Blazer Way</a>, a creed that celebrates accountability as we represent our unique community with honor and integrity. </p>

<p>At this time, being a Blazer means doing our part to keep our community safe by following <a href="https://www.uab.edu/coronavirus/social-distancing">important guidelines</a>: </p>
<ul>
<li>Wear a mask/face covering when around others </li>
<li>Clean and disinfect frequently touched objects </li>
<li>Stay at least 6 feet away from others</li>
<li>Practice good hand hygiene, and avoid touching your face</li>
<li>Cover your mouth and nose with your sleeve when you sneeze or cough </li>
</ul>

<p>Additional guidance and resources from <a href="https://www.uab.edu/students/health/">Student Health</a> are available online. Remember, <a href="https://www.uab.edu/students/counseling/">free counseling</a> can be a helpful resource in times of isolation and uncertainty.  </p>

<h3>
    Additional Resources
</h3>
<p>There are many resources available to you, including <a href="https://www.uab.edu/benfund/blazer-kitchen">Blazer Kitchen</a> for those with food insecurity, <a href="https://padlock.idm.uab.edu/cas/login?service=https%3A%2F%2Fcm.maxient.com%2Freportingform.php%3FUnivofAlabamaBirmingham%26layout_id%3D16">financial assistance</a> through UAB and the <a href="https://www.uab.edu/coronavirus/heerf">Higher Education Emergency Relief Fund (CARES Act, June 1 deadline)</a>, and <a href="https://www.uab.edu/elearning/students">remote learning guidance and tools</a>, as well as answers to many frequently asked questions and more. Please visit <a href="http://www.uab.edu/coronavirus">uab.edu/coronavirus</a> for details. </p>

<h3>
    Updates and Planning  
</h3>
<p>In partnership with the University of Alabama System and with the support of the Board of Trustees, we are committed to making our campus among the safest in America as you return at the right time and under the right conditions. On-campus classes remain canceled for the summer, but our goal is to resume in-person classes in the fall. </p>

<p>Between now and then, we plan to phase in a <a href="https://www.uab.edu/coronavirus/reentry">gradual re-entry to campus</a>, taking into account the dynamic and evolving circumstances. In this plan, some groups will return to campus before others. At this time, some students in clinical and research roles are beginning to return to campus (mostly postdoctoral and graduate/pre-doctoral students with limited exceptions for undergraduates) with prior approval, training and a health check. </p>

<p>Task forces are developing comprehensive plans for a safe fall semester re-entry, including training and testing, enter/exit control, personal protective equipment, social distancing, and hygiene. We will have protocols for classrooms, dining, residence halls, recreation, health and counseling services, and other areas critical to a safe return. To promote classroom safety, we are exploring a variety of learning models that we will review with student and faculty leaders to identify the best solution for UAB.</p>

<p>Current plans are for our return to be supported by UAB’s Safe Together Now platform, which includes a symptom and exposure tracking COVID-19 assessment tool, as well as an anonymous, <a href="https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/security/laws-regulations/index.html">HIPAA-privacy compliant</a> contact tracer in partnership with Apple, Google and the Alabama Department of Public Health. </p>

<p>Many experts are involved in our planning. Earlier this month, we captured some other ways UAB experts are making a difference in our community and beyond. UAB students, faculty and staff have demonstrated a great fighting spirit of resilience and innovation in these times. </p>

<p>Thank you for all you have done and continue to do. </p>

<p>Ever Faithful. Ever Loyal.</p>

                <div class="uk-margin"><p>
    To say these are unprecedented times is an understatement. The challenges posed by the novel coronavirus COVID-19 are tremendous, and we realize you have had to face a lot of uncertainty and change in a short amount of time.</p>

<p>
The decision to move to virtual instruction was made with your health and well-being in mind. The goal of these changes is to minimize the need to gather in large groups and spend prolonged time in proximity with each other in spaces. As part of our Academic Continuity Plan, we are adding a supplemental plan to allow a student to elect pass/fail grading in spring semester courses, on a course-by-course basis. <a href="/coronavirus/images/documents/grading-attachment-for-students.pdf" target="_blank">The details are included here</a>. Please read over this so you are prepared to speak with your professors about any of these changes.
</p>

<p>
Even though we will be working at a distance, I am personally reminded of just how connected we are to one another. You each have had to adapt quickly and change behaviors to keep our community safe. I am proud to be a Blazer right alongside you, and we will continue to work together each step of the way. 
</p>

<p>
Our dedicated faculty have been working around the clock to respond to the challenges posed by COVID-19. Our instructors have developed creative ways to adapt their materials to our new environment. Be sure to watch for their updates in your inbox. I am especially grateful to our eLearning and Center for Teaching and Learning staffs who have made resources available to instructors and students. I invite you all to visit uab.edu/coronavirus and peruse the Student section to become familiar with resources available to help you prepare for online learning.
</p>

<p>
This new reality is still fluid and uncertain. It is normal to experience feelings of stress and frustration, but I want you to know that we are here for you and that we are in this together. I encourage you to check out the Student resources, specifically those for your mental health and well-being, at uab.edu/coronavirus. UAB Blazers are resilient, and we will overcome each hurdle together.
</p>

<p>
We are excited about welcoming you back to classes tomorrow. Your learning and progress move us forward toward a bright and exciting future.

    <h3 class="uk-accordion-title"><span>Office of the Provost cancels study abroad programs through Aug. 15</span> Wednesday, March 18 at 12 p.m.</h3>

    <div class="uk-accordion-content">

        
        
        
                <div class="uk-margin"><p>
    UAB continues to monitor the worldwide novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic while keeping your impending study abroad in mind. The health and safety of our students is our top priority when it comes to our education abroad programs; therefore, the university has issued the following decision:  
</p><p>
Effective immediately, the university is <strong>suspending all UAB Education Abroad programs through August 15 as a result of the <a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/traveladvisories/ea/travel-advisory-alert-global-level-3-health-advisory-issue.html" target="_blank">U.S. Department of State Global Level 3 Health Advisory-Reconsider Travel</a>.</strong> 
 </p><p>
It is for this reason that study abroad taking place in summer 2020 is cancelled.  
 </p>
<h4>
    For students on faculty-led programs
</h4><p>
The Office of Education Abroad will encourage faculty leaders to redevelop their courses to be facilitated at UAB.  Please watch for further communication from your faculty member.  If you individually purchased airfare, refund considerations will be collected by the Office of Education Abroad with proof that the air carrier will not issue a refund or flight credit due to the worldwide pandemic.
 </p>
<h4>
    For students on summer affiliate programs

</h4><p>
The Office of Education Abroad encourages students to work with their academic advisors to identify alternative courses to ensure their academic progress.
 </p><h4>
Financials Processes

</h4><p>
UAB Education Abroad will be working to refund any fees paid directly to our office, including the admin fee and faculty led program fees, via original payment. This may take a little time with UAB limited business operations but we will notify you when this has occurred.  <strong>If you applied for summer 2020 scholarships, we encourage you to consider applying for a future term, as your effort this summer will not go unnoticed.</strong>
 </p><p>
We are saddened by the worldwide effects of the pandemic, including the impact on your study abroad plans. However, we hope you understand that your health is our highest priority and that this decision has not been taken lightly. We understand that this information may be overwhelming, but please know that the university stands ready to assist students with these resources. 
 </p><p>
We sincerely hope that you’ll consider studying abroad in the future — our team stands ready to assist you with deferring your plans.

</p><p>
Due to the rapid escalation of the COVID-19 pandemic, <strong>UAB needs to minimize the volume of people on campus as quickly as possible</strong> to protect the health and safety of students, faculty and staff, and our community.
    
</p>
 <p>
<strong>We need your help during this difficult and unprecedented time.</strong> Online classes will begin on Wednesday, March 25, after an extended spring break.

<li>We have consulted at length with COVID-19 experts. For safety reasons, only students who do not have a place to go (e.g., students with an exceptional hardship or international students) can be allowed to stay in a residence hall. </li>
<li><strong>Take any essential belongings and school-related resources you will need with you.</strong> </li>
</ul>
    
<p>
I realize this is a very difficult situation. It was our desire to minimize disruptions by accommodating students who preferred to stay on campus during spring break. However, it has become clear that the COVID-19 pandemic — now a state and national emergency — requires us to drastically reduce the number of people on campus for safety reasons. 

</p><p>
<strong>The Student Affairs team is here to support you in this transition and will do what we can, but we must ask for your cooperation during this public health crisis.
</strong>
    
</p><p>
<em><strong>A note for student workers/employees:</strong> UAB will be moving to limited business operations for university employees in <a href="https://www.uab.edu/humanresources/home/wfgroups" target="_blank">Workgroup A</a> no later than 5 p.m. Monday, March 16, that will only allow for essential employees to come to campus, with others working from home or not working. On-campus student employment will be suspended with very few exceptions for a period of at least 14 days. During this two-week period, student employees/workers will be paid. In the event of a prolonged disruption, leadership will work with all sources (federal, state, etc.) in an effort to continue financial support of our employees. Further, UAB Leadership is exploring opportunities — including possible use of the Benevolent Fund — to financially help employees who encounter hardships due to the suspension of work IF limited business last longer than two weeks.
</em>    
</p><p>
We are committed to making this transition as smooth as possible. For more COVID-19 updates and information, please check your emails regularly and access the student information pages under "Info for You" at <a href="/coronavirus/">uab.edu/coronavirus</a>.</div>

<p>For the health and safety of our residents, all overnight visitation in the residence halls is immediately suspended until further notice with the exception of guests approved by 5 p.m. March 13.</p>

<h3>All Students</h3>

<p>Also note Hill Student Center, inclusive of dining options, will close at 7 p.m. Sunday, March 15, and Campus Recreation will close operations at 9 p.m. Monday, March 16 until further notice.</p>

<p>Student workers/employees/interns who remain on campus and want to continue working may be able to maintain their normal work schedule. As the situation continues to develop, be in contact with your supervisor.</p>
<p>
    For graduate students appointed in a graduate position receiving a monthly stipend (Graduate Research Assistant, Graduate Teaching Assistant, Graduate Student Trainee) stipend payments will continue.  Please consult your Mentor or Graduate Program Director regarding ongoing research and teaching obligations in order to coordinate a plan for on-campus work.  Graduate Students appointed in to a “Graduate Assistant” position (paid bi-weekly), will be paid for a period of 14 days, and then UAB will reassess.

<p>Student Health will remain open, but anyone who suspects that they might be contagious should call first — 205-934-3580 during regular hours or 205-934-3411 after hours to page the provider on call.</p>

<p>We know you will have more questions, and we are working to organize a webinar/online town hall to answer them and make this transition as smooth as possible.</p>

Given that the majority of our summer courses offered after June 22 have already transitioned to an online format, we will <strong>not</strong> offer in-person/on-site classes for summer 2020.

<p>Students, please work with your faculty members to access materials and utilize all the teaching and learning tools we have posted for you.

<p>As we have previously announced, we will not hold in-person orientations or commencement ceremonies until further notice. We have online programming prepared for both.

    In partnership with the University of Alabama System and with the support of the Board of Trustees, UAB is committed to making our campus among the safest in America as students return at the right time and under the right conditions. On June 10, 2020, the University of Alabama System approved plans for a safe return to all three of its campuses. <a href="http://uasystem.edu/news/2020/02/ua-system-covid-19-updates/">Click here to see the full plan.</a> </p>
<h3>
    Update on Fall 2020 Semester
</h3>
<p>The University of Alabama System is planning a safe return this fall with a hybrid model – a course delivery system which, because of social distancing precautions, requires a combination of both in-person instruction and remote instruction. To promote the health and safety of the campus community, adjustments have been made to the fall semester schedule:</p>

<ul>
<li>Fall semester hybrid classes will start Monday, Aug. 24, 2020.</li>
<li>Fall semester hybrid classes will end Friday, Nov. 20, for the Thanksgiving break.</li>
<li>Students will not return to campus after Thanksgiving break. 
<br><em>Exceptions can be granted for students based on work, research or clinical responsibilities, and accommodations can be requested for international students or others who do not have alternate living arrangements. </em></li>
<li>Classes during the week of Nov. 30-Dec. 4, as well as final exams during the week of Dec. 7-11, will be conducted remotely.
<br><em>Coursework engagement during these weeks is necessary to accommodate SACSCOC accrediting standard requirements for credit granted for coursework.</em></li>
</ul>

                <div class="uk-margin"><p>
    At this time, <strong>UAB requires social distancing and masks on campus</strong>. To minimize social interaction in the interest of safety, meetings should be held virtually as much as possible until further notice. </p>
<ul>
<li>Any on-campus meeting will require attendees to maintain at least a 6-foot radius distance from all other people, and attendees should wear a mask/face covering. </li>
<li>At this time, no groups of more than 10 attendees may gather on campus without prior approval. Any meeting exceeding 10 individuals in one place should be of an essential nature and will require prior approval from a dean or vice president. </li>
<li>Unit-specific re-entry operational plans should consider the density of offices/employees and implement strategies that uphold social distancing guidelines. If circumstances in a particular setting make social distancing difficult, consider alternate schedules, remote work or other strategies. Some activities may require personnel to work within a 6-foot radius, but it is critical to keep those interactions to a minimum.</li>
</ul>
<p>This guidance will evolve in future phases of Modified Business Operations and campus re-entry as we continue to monitor and assess the fluid and dynamic circumstances presented by the COVID-19 pandemic.

    If you were evaluated and tested through Student Health, your provider will give you details on when to expect your test results, as well as self-care at home. Furthermore, a nurse will be contacting you regularly to follow up on your symptoms and test results. If you were tested at another location, that location will contact you with test results, but if you let us know you were tested, a nurse can still contact you to check in regularly.

    <h3 class="uk-accordion-title">What if someone is diagnosed? How will I know if I was in contact?</h3>

    <div class="uk-accordion-content">

        
        
        
                <div class="uk-margin"><p>
    The health and safety of the campus community is our top priority. There is a process in place to make appropriate assessments and notifications to those who may have been exposed to a confirmed case of COVID-19. How the University needs to respond will depend on the circumstances. In accordance with health department protocols and federal privacy laws, notifications and/or details will be determined based on who needs to know for health reasons.
</p>
<p>
    Alabama and Jefferson County are experiencing community spread of COVID-19. UAB has taken proactive steps to fight the pandemic (e.g., online/alternative classes, limited business operations, aggressive social distancing), but we expect people to have questions about how they may be notified if they were in contact with someone who tested positive as testing increases in Birmingham. Based on requirements regarding student, employee, and patient privacy, we are limited in what health information can be shared, but UAB is working closely with the Alabama Department of Public Health and Jefferson County Department of Health.
</p>
<p>
    The health department gathers and provides verified tests, contacts the case, determines the contacts at risk, and notifies them of what to do. If an individual is determined to have been in close contact with someone who has been diagnosed, ADPH — or an official designee (which could be UAB Student or Employee Health, or Human Resources) — will contact that individual to discuss next steps.

    If you think you have been exposed to someone with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19, <a href="/coronavirus/images/documents/What_to_do_if_you_were_potentially_exposed_to_someone_with_confirmed_coronavirus_disease.pdf" target="_blank">follow these steps to monitor your health</a> to avoid spreading the disease to others if you get sick. Stay home except to get medical care.
</p>
<ul>
<li>Separate yourself from other people and animals in your home.</li>
<li>Call ahead before visiting your doctor.</li>
<li>Wear a face mask when you are around other people.</li>
<li>Cover your coughs and sneezes.</li>
<li>Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds or use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer.</li>
<li>Avoid sharing personal household items like dishes, cups, towels, and bedding.</li>
<li>Clean all “high-touch” surfaces every day with a household cleaning spray or wipe.</li>
<li>Monitor your symptoms and let your healthcare provider know you are experiencing symptoms that may be related to COVID-19.</li>
<li>If you are told to go to the doctor’s office, wear a face mask before entering the facility.</li>
</ul>
<p>
    If you get sick with fever, cough or shortness of breath (even if your symptoms are very mild), you likely have COVID-19. You should isolate yourself at home and away from other people. If you have any of the following conditions that may increase your risk for a serious infection—age 60 years or older, are pregnant, or have medical conditions—contact your physician’s office and tell them that you were exposed to someone with COVID-19. They may want to monitor your health more closely or test you for COVID-19.
</p>
<p>
    If you do not have a high-risk condition but want medical advice, call your healthcare provider and tell them you were exposed to someone with COVID-19. Your healthcare provider can help you decide if you need to be evaluated in person. There are currently no medications to treat COVID-19.</p>
<p>If you have a medical emergency and need to call 911, notify the dispatch personnel that you may have been exposed to COVID-19. If possible, put on a face mask before emergency medical services arrive or immediately after they arrive.

<p>The University of Alabama System is planning a safe return this fall with a hybrid model – a course delivery system which, because of social distancing precautions, requires a combination of both in-person instruction and remote instruction. To promote the health and safety of the campus community, adjustments have been made to the fall semester schedule:</p>

<ul>
<li>Fall semester hybrid classes will start Monday, Aug. 24, 2020.</li>
<li>Fall semester hybrid classes will end Friday, Nov. 20, for the Thanksgiving break.</li>
<li>Students will not return to campus after Thanksgiving break. 
<br><em>Exceptions can be granted for students based on work, research or clinical responsibilities, and accommodations can be requested for international students or others who do not have alternate living arrangements. </em></li>
<li>Classes during the week of Nov. 30-Dec. 4, as well as final exams during the week of Dec. 7-11, will be conducted remotely.
<br><em>Coursework engagement during these weeks is necessary to accommodate SACSCOC accrediting standard requirements for credit granted for coursework.</em></li>
</ul>

    Despite our nation's efforts to slowly reopen our cities and economies, COVID-19 continues to be a very real and serious threat to the health and safety of our community and will continue to be into the fall semester as well. As a result, it is vital for us to implement strict protocols and practices within the residence halls to continue to keep you and your families as safe as possible.</p>
<p>Please carefully review the changes outlined below. Additional information will be sent on a regular basis throughout the rest of the summer. </p>

<ul>
    
<li>All residence hall rooms, lobbies, lounges, and laundry rooms will be thoroughly cleaned, disinfected, and sanitized prior to opening for fall. Common area spaces (lobbies, lounges, laundry rooms, elevators) will be cleaned more frequently throughout the day during the year.</li>
<li>Residents will be required to complete an online COVID safety precaution training module and a contract addendum prior to arriving on campus to move in.</li>
<li>We anticipate that all residents – symptomatic or not – will be asked to be tested for COVID-19 before moving into the residence halls. More information will be provided as details and guidance are available.</li>
<li>Green Hall (our newest residence hall currently under construction) will not be completely open for operation until late Fall 2020; some students will have an opportunity to delay moving on campus until it is complete.

    <li>Rast and Blount Halls have private bedrooms and will be fully occupied this fall. Because the common areas will be used by up to four people, residents in these halls will be required to clean and disinfect their apartments weekly.</li>
<li>Students who require any special accommodations must register with Disability Student Services to provide the required documentation for housing accommodation requests. If you have not already started this process, we encourage you to do so as soon as possible. For more information, go to <a href="http://www.uab.edu/dss">www.uab.edu/dss</a>.</li>
<li>Residents will only be allowed limited personal belongings in the halls this fall - more details will follow.</li>
<li>VISITORS WILL NOT BE ALLOWED IN ANY UAB RESIDENCE HALL FOR THE ENTIRE FALL SEMESTER.</li>
<li>In-hall gatherings will be very limited and prohibited for groups larger than ten (10) people.</li>
<li>Lounges and lobbies will be restricted to ten (10) people or less, and 6 feet of separation between individuals must be maintained.</li>
<li>Face masks will be required in common areas and wearing them will be enforced.</li>
<li>No more than two residents on an elevator at a time – riders will face opposite walls with face masks in place.</li>
<li>Residents must notify Student Health should they experience any symptoms related to COVID-19.</li>
<li>Residents must self-isolate if they have COVID-related symptoms. Apartments designated for quarantine and isolation will be made available; residents will be required to temporarily relocate to those spaces until symptoms subside and Student Health clears them to return to their assigned residence hall.</li>
<li>UAB plans to make exposure notification technology available to anonymously alert individuals of possible exposure to someone who has tested positive for COVID-19.  </li>
<li>Students will be required to complete a web-based health check assessment, and students may be asked to participate in voluntary, sentinel COVID-19 testing during the semester.</li>
</ul>

<p>Freshmen whose circumstances have changed since applying for housing and may now wish to cancel their fall application may do so at this time. If cancelled on or before July 1, students will receive a full refund of all Fall 2020 housing application fees paid to date. A separate email will be sent with instructions for cancelling upon your request. We are working earnestly to fully reopen in the fall and encourage you to consider the above changes in our practices and their impact on your college success and experience. We join with you in making the necessary changes to our routines to successfully emerge from this crisis and return to our normal operations within Student Housing.

    Many higher education institutions have made this decision to prevent the spread of the virus after students have travelled and then returned to the campus.  UAB considered public health recommendations and made this decision to protect the health and safety of our university community.

    <h3 class="uk-accordion-title">What is a hybrid class? How will it work?</h3>

                <div class="uk-margin"><p>
    The course format allows for flexibility in using remote and in-person learning. Essentially, it is a blend of in-class instruction and either synchronous or asynchronous remote viewing of the same content delivery. Given the social distancing requirements dictated by the health and safety precautions implemented to address the current COVID-19 pandemic, a hybrid delivery model was seen as an optimal choice. The model also allows one to easily and quickly shift to completely remote delivery should circumstances surrounding the pandemic, or any other natural disaster, dictate such a transition.</p>
 
<p>Utilizing this format allows students to experience both in-class and remote instruction. Both incoming freshmen and returning students across the nation highly value in-class instruction, more so than traditional face-to-face or remote instruction. This still allows the necessary health and safety precautions dictated by the pandemic to be implemented. The basic idea is to have 50% of students in Tuesday-Thursday classes and 33% of students in Monday-Wednesday-Friday classes be in class on a given day. In this format, the instructor will present his/her class lecture which will be captured by new camera systems being installed in designated classrooms across campus. The video feed of the in-class presentation will be available synchronously to the remaining registered students as well as stored and available on Canvas for asynchronous viewing. Students will alternate in-class and remote options in a way yet to be determined.   The instructional format is dependent on the objectives of a specific course and the ability to socially distance.

                <div class="uk-margin"><p>
    If the course was originally scheduled to be online, students will pay the online rate. If your course is delivered as hybrid, in person or remote, students will continue to pay the standard tuition rate. In-state students will pay the in-state rate and out-of-state students will pay the out of state tuition rate.  The differential between in and out of state tuition reflect that in state students and their families also contribute through their state taxes to higher education institutions.

                <div class="uk-margin"><p>
    No. You have the option to move as many or as few (or none) of your classes to P/F, assuming the option is available. The default grading method will be the normal letter grade method and we encourage you to continue taking courses for a letter grade where possible. Where we can, we are providing a Pass/Fail option in case there are circumstances and/or challenges students are encountering related to the ongoing pandemic that might make a Pass/Fail option a better option. Post-baccalaureate students, for example, will most likely be better able to compete for future positions if they have letter grades.

    Despite our nation's efforts to slowly reopen our cities and economies, COVID-19 continues to be a very real and serious threat to the health and safety of our community and will continue to be into the fall semester as well. As a result, it is vital for us to implement strict protocols and practices within the residence halls to continue to keep you and your families as safe as possible.</p>

<ul>
<li>All residence hall rooms, lobbies, lounges, and laundry rooms will be thoroughly cleaned, disinfected, and sanitized prior to opening for fall. Common area spaces (lobbies, lounges, laundry rooms, elevators) will be cleaned more frequently throughout the day during the year.</li>
<li>Residents will be required to complete an online COVID safety precaution training module and a contract addendum prior to arriving on campus to move in.</li>
<li>We anticipate that all residents – symptomatic or not – will be asked to be tested for COVID-19 before moving into the residence halls. More information will be provided as details and guidance are available.</li>
<li>Green Hall (our newest residence hall currently under construction) will not be completely open for operation until late Fall 2020; some students will have an opportunity to delay moving on campus until it is complete. If you would like to consider this option, please notify us at <span id="cloakd796fa2cb68d8856809aec2ca12b16d8">This email address is being protected from spambots.

    HEERF is a fund coordinated by Financial Aid. Funds provide emergency funding to eligible students to help cover some expenses related to the disruption of campus operations because of COVID-19.</p>
<p>Students who were enrolled at UAB for the Spring 2020 semester and meet Title IV eligibility requirements are eligible for this funding. UAB is awarding the funding based on a student’s Expected Family Contribution (EFC), with awards ranging from $50 to $900.</p>
<ul>
<li>Title IV eligibility requirements include U.S. citizenship (or eligible noncitizen); valid Social Security number; registration with Selective Service (for male students); and enrollment in a degree or certificate program (in the Spring 2020 semester).</li>
<li>Not all students are eligible; this includes international students, undocumented students, Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) and students who were enrolled exclusively in online programs in the Spring 2020 semester.</li>
</ul>
<p>To receive these funds, students must certify that they have incurred expenses related to the disruption due to COVID-19. You can complete this certification through this <a href="http://click.reach.uab.edu/?qs=da12d76c742cd1943915ca1e2807d4ac39e3ae065c4c8ef484915b9b3d4e47175811c00f130486707cd7853d580ea94789c0a2b4ce5f807e">online form</a> now through June 1.   </p>
<p>In order to determine Title IV eligibility, students must also have a Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) form for the 2019-2020 academic year on file in order to be considered. You may fill out the FAFSA form now if you have not already done so by going to this page on <a href="http://click.reach.uab.edu/?qs=da12d76c742cd194acc12fe0bb2e1c529500973ce6c9e30b6dd0edf1ff0efa2f8003aba73e09b8d37fa7468ea1650afdbec1db0a8221727d">studentaid.gov</a>.

    If the course was originally scheduled to be online, students will pay the online rate. If your course is delivered as hybrid, in person or remote, students will continue to pay the standard tuition rate. In-state students will pay the in-state rate and out-of-state students will pay the out of state tuition rate.  The differential between in and out of state tuition reflect that in state students and their families also contribute through their state taxes to higher education institutions.

    <h3 class="uk-accordion-title">What is a hybrid class? How it will work?</h3>

    <div class="uk-accordion-content">

        
        
        
                <div class="uk-margin"><p>
    The course format allows for flexibility in using remote and in-person learning. Essentially, it is a blend of in-class instruction and either synchronous or asynchronous remote viewing of the same content delivery. Given the social distancing requirements dictated by the health and safety precautions implemented to address the current COVID-19 pandemic, a hybrid delivery model was seen as an optimal choice. The model also allows one to easily and quickly shift to completely remote delivery should circumstances surrounding the pandemic, or any other natural disaster, dictate such a transition.</p>
 
<p>Utilizing this format allows students to experience both in-class and remote instruction. Both incoming freshmen and returning students across the nation highly value in-class instruction, more so than traditional f2f or remote instruction. This still allows the necessary health and safety precautions dictated by the pandemic to be implemented. The basic idea is to have 50% of students in Tuesday-Thursday classes and 33% of students in Monday-Wednesday-Friday classes be in class on a given day. In this format, the instructor will present his/her class lecture which will be captured by new camera systems being installed in designated classrooms across campus. The video feed of the in-class presentation will be available synchronously to the remaining registered students as well as stored and available on Canvas for asynchronous viewing. Students will alternate in-class and remote options in a way yet to be determined.   The instructional format is dependent on the objectives of a specific course and the ability to socially distance.

    “Essential,” as defined in the March 11, 11:45 a.m. email ("Required Review of Domestic Travel, Events and Visitor(s)"), is a determination made by:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Deans for activities in schools and colleges</li>
<li>VPs and/or AVPs for activities in administrative units (each VP will determine the appropriate starting point for his or her unit)</li>
<li>Athletic administrators for activities in Athletics</li>
</ul>
<p>
    Decisions should be based on the relative risk of the travel, understanding that our top priority as an institution is the health and safety of our campus community.
</p>
<p>
    Questions to ask when considering the necessity of travel include:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Can you explain why the travel is essential?</li>
<li>Can the travel be postponed?</li>
<li>Can the purpose of the travel be accomplished in another way (e.g., virtually)?</li>

    The university has suspended all UAB Education Abroad programs through August 15 as a result of the U.S. Department of State Global Level 3 Health Advisory-Reconsider Travel. On March 19, the Department of State upgraded this advisory to <a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/traveladvisories/ea/travel-advisory-alert-global-level-4-health-advisory-issue.html" target="_blank">Level 4 - Do Not Travel</a>.
</p>
<h4>
    For students on faculty-led programs
</h4>
<p>
    The Office of Education Abroad will encourage faculty leaders to redevelop their courses to be facilitated at UAB. Please watch for further communication from your faculty member. If you individually purchased airfare, refund considerations will be collected by the Office of Education Abroad with proof that the air carrier will not issue a refund or flight credit due to the worldwide pandemic.
</p>
<h4>
    For students on summer affiliate programs
</h4>
<p>
    The Office of Education Abroad encourages students to work with their academic advisors to identify alternative courses to ensure their academic progress.
</p>
<h4>
    Financials processes
</h4>
<p>
    UAB Education Abroad will be working to refund any fees paid directly to our office, including the admin fee and faculty led program fees, via original payment. This may take a little time with UAB limited business operations but we will notify you when this has occurred. If you applied for summer 2020 scholarships, we encourage you to consider applying for a future term, as your effort this summer will not go unnoticed.
</p>
<p>
    We are saddened by the worldwide effects of the pandemic, including the impact on your study abroad plans. However, we hope you understand that your health is our highest priority and that this decision has not been taken lightly. We understand that this information may be overwhelming, but please know that the university stands ready to assist students with these resources.</p>
<p>We sincerely hope that you’ll consider studying abroad in the future — our team stands ready to assist you with deferring your plans.

                <div class="uk-margin"><p>
 
    UAB students, faculty and staff,</p>

<p>As we continue in partnership with the UA System to implement our <a href="https://www.uab.edu/coronavirus/reentry">phased approach</a> to gradually <a href="https://www.uab.edu/coronavirus/reentry/uab-united?utm_source=StudentHome&utm_medium=UABWeb&utm_campaign=UABUnited">unite on campus</a>, UAB and UAB Medicine strive to be the safest campus in America and keep health and safety our top priority. Among many other strategies, we are adopting <a href="https://www.uab.edu/coronavirus/reentry/covid-19-testing">sentinel testing</a> as an additional layer to minimize risk and support a continued re-entry. </p>

<p>The sentinel testing system collects information useful for monitoring trends in diseases and pathogens. We plan to test between 2.5% to 5% of the on-campus population weekly to detect how COVID-19 may be circulating among our asymptomatic population. The test will be a self-administered swab of the nostril. <a href="https://www.uab.edu/coronavirus/reentry/covid-19-testing">Click here for additional information and frequently asked questions about sentinel testing.</a> </p>

<p>

This random sentinel COVID-19 testing of those who have returned to campus will begin the week of July 6. Those selected for testing will receive an email on the Sunday of the week they are to be tested, with instructions on how and where to get tested. 
</p>

<p>
Submitting to sentinel testing is voluntary. Your choice to participate or not will in no way impact your employment or your status as a student.  Nevertheless, we hope that you will participate and help us in the fight against this virus. Sentinel testing will supplement <a href="https://www.uab.edu/news/campus/item/11404-governor-ivey-announces-covid-19-testing-safety-programs-developed-by-uab-and-the-state-department-of-public-health-to-support-higher-ed-statewide">mandatory COVID-19 testing for returning students</a> through the Testing for Alabama program announced on June 29. Additional testing strategies for employees are being explored. 
</p>

Students, please continue to read the Greenmail e-newsletter every Wednesday for important announcements and details about reentry. Faculty and staff, please continue to read <a href="http://www.uab.edu/reporter">eReporter</a>, and UAB Medicine employees also read <a href="https://www.oneuabmedicine.org/">ONE</a>.

                <div class="uk-margin"><p>
    UAB students, faculty and staff,</p>
<p>To promote health and safety on campus as part of our comprehensive reentry planning, all UAB students returning for the fall semester will receive a free COVID-19 test, supported by CARES Act funding through the State of Alabama. Throughout the semester, random, voluntary sentinel testing will be provided to some students to help identify trends and potential problem areas.</p>
<p>In partnership with the University of Alabama System, UAB has led an effort with the State of Alabama to create the Testing for Alabama program. Through the program, all students of two- and four-year higher education institutions can receive a free COVID-19 reentry test. Read the announcement at <a href="https://www.uab.edu/news/campus/item/11404">UAB news online</a>.</p>
<p>Protocols for how testing will be administered are being developed. We anticipate the test will likely be either a swab in the nostril — though not the more invasive nasopharyngeal swab — or an oral saline gargle test that we currently have under development. </p>
<p>Our ability to test every student returning to campus will go a long way in helping us maintain a safe environment. We are excited that, through our partnership with Governor Kay Ivey and the State Department of Health, we can have a broader impact in our state by helping make testing available to public colleges and universities throughout Alabama.</p>
<p>On our campus, testing will supplement other strategies to maintain a safe environment, like the <a href="https://www.staysafetogether.org/">Stay Safe Together™</a> platform that includes our COVID assessment healthcheck symptom monitoring tool. UAB is also developing a voluntary exposure notification app powered by Apple and Google that we look forward to rolling out in the coming weeks. </p>
<p>In addition to COVID-19 testing for students through Testing for Alabama, a sentinel testing system for on-campus faculty and staff was piloted in June and will be implemented broadly starting on July 8. Additional testing strategies for employees are being explored. </p>
<p>Updates will be communicated to students through the Greenmail newsletter, and to faculty and staff in eReporter.  </p>

                <div class="uk-margin"><p>
    UAB students, faculty and staff,</p>

<p>As UAB continues our phased, gradual <a href="https://www.uab.edu/coronavirus/reentry">reentry to campus</a>, we want to assure you that our COVID-19 safety protocols, based on the input of infectious disease and public health experts, will be enforced to help promote the health of our community and the continuity of our mission. </p>

<p>We know that creating and maintaining a culture of safety will require awareness, vigilance, monitoring, effective structures for reporting concerns and corrective action for non-compliance.</p> 

<p>We need to be <a href="https://www.uab.edu/coronavirus/reentry/uab-united">united for our common good</a>, and each of us has a role to play.</p> 

<p>UAB’s <a href="https://www.uab.edu/coronavirus/reentry/expectations-guidelines">Reentry Expectations and Guidelines</a> are posted online at <a href="http://uab.edu/reentry">uab.edu/reentry</a>, as are <a href="https://www.uab.edu/coronavirus/reentry/personal-safety-practices">Personal Safety Practices</a>. Everyone who returns to campus is expected to comply fully with these safety protocols and any specialized guidance from their particular departments/units/schools. We also ask that — to protect the UAB family and our broader community — you practice safety guidelines when you are off campus. </p>

<p>If you observe that health and safety rules are not being observed or enforced on campus, discuss your concerns with your supervisor. If non-compliance persists, you may contact Human Resources or report it anonymously through the <a href="https://www.uab.edu/ethics/file-a-report-online/options">UAB Ethics Hotline</a>. Anyone who reports non-compliance is protected against retaliation, and concerns of retaliation should be reported to Human Resources or the Office of Compliance and Risk Assurance.</p>

<p>Persistent failure or willful disregard for health and safety protocols by any employee or student will result in consequences consistent with UAB’s discipline policies for <a href="https://www.uab.edu/policies/content/Pages/UAB-HR-POL-0000230.html#:~:text=Abstract%3A,listed%20and%20described%20in%20detail.">staff</a>, <a href="https://www.uab.edu/policies/Pages/Faculty-Handbook.html">faculty</a> and <a href="https://www.uab.edu/policies/content/Pages/UAB-UC-POL-0000781.html">students</a>.</p>

<p>We are committed to preserving the health of the communities in which we live, learn and work, and the safety precautions we have adopted and will continue to adopt to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic apply to everyone equally. By observing them, we are confident we can continue to teach and learn, research, support Alabama’s social and economic needs, and deliver vital patient care.</p>

<p>Students, please continue to read the Greenmail e-newsletter every Wednesday for important announcements and details about reentry. Faculty and staff, please continue to read <a href="http://www.uab.edu/reporter">eReporter</a>, and UAB Medicine employees also read <a href="https://www.oneuabmedicine.org/">ONE</a>.

    UAB students, faculty and staff,</p>
 
<p>Our <a href="http://www.uab.edu/reentry">gradual re-entry to campus</a> continues and is going well, as is our planning with the University of Alabama System for a safe return this fall with a hybrid model – a course delivery system which, because of social distancing precautions, requires a combination of both in-person instruction and remote instruction. To promote the health and safety of the campus community, adjustments have been made to the fall semester schedule:</p>
 
<ul>
<li>Fall semester hybrid classes will start Monday, Aug. 24, 2020.</li>
<li>Fall semester hybrid classes will end Friday, Nov. 20, for the Thanksgiving break.</li>
<li>Students will not return to campus after Thanksgiving break. </li>
<li>Exceptions can be granted for students based on work, research or clinical responsibilities, and accommodations can be requested for international students or others who do not have alternate living arrangements.  </li>
<li>Classes during the week of Nov. 30-Dec. 4, as well as final exams during the week of Dec. 7-11, will be conducted remotely.<br>
<em>Coursework engagement during these weeks is necessary to accommodate <a href="https://sacscoc.org/accrediting-standards/">SACSCOC accrediting standard</a> requirements for credit granted for coursework. </em></li>
</ul>

<p>Additional information for our phased re-entry to campus (including details about on-campus housing, classroom protocols, personal protective equipment, and COVID-19 training and testing) continue to be worked out and will be communicated in the coming days and weeks. UAB’s e-newsletters are your source of official information. To stay informed of the latest news and updates, students are encouraged read Greenmail each Wednesday, and faculty and staff are encouraged to read eReporter each Tuesday and Friday.

<p>UAB faculty and staff,
    
</p>
 <p>
    Earlier this week, the university announced a gradual, phased approach to campus re-entry detailed at <a href="http://www.uab.edu/reentry">www.uab.edu/reentry</a>. 
</p>

 <p>
   Phase I, which is set for May 26 through June 15, includes the gradual re-entry of some individuals with clinical or research responsibilities. This time period is a window in which individuals approved to return in this phase will begin campus re-entry; not everyone in Phase I will return May 26.  
</p>

<p>
   Before individuals in Phase I (or any future phase) re-enter campus, several steps must be completed: 
</p> 

<ol>
<li>Supervisors will draft a unit-specific operational re-entry plan and submit it for approval.</li>
<li>Subsequently, you will receive an email from Campus Learning (<span id="cloak873208547ea0d4611adcb7bd1de0039b">This email address is being protected from spambots. You need JavaScript enabled to view it.</span><script type='text/javascript'>

<li>When you receive the email from the learning management system, follow the prompts and complete required training.</li>

<li>After you complete the required training and health check, your supervisor will be notified that you are approved to return to campus.</li>
</ol>
 
<p>No one is permitted to return to campus until they have completed these steps and have clearance for re-entry from their supervisor. When you return, you must follow all safety guidelines. You should not initiate training modules until you receive prompts from Campus Learning by email. This is to verify that UAB personnel have completed their training.</p>
 

<p><a href="https://www.uab.edu/coronavirus/reentry/reentry-to-campus-checklist">Re-entry checklists are available</a> to guide students, faculty and staff as they prepare for their return to campus and when they are on campus. </p>

<p>At this time, not everyone will know into which re-entry phase they fit and when they will be approved to return. Contact your supervisor with questions about your phase. We will continue to support units in the development of their required operational plans so updates can be provided.</p>

    <h3 class="uk-accordion-title"><span id="reentry">University Gradual Re-entry to Campus</span>Monday, May 18 at 4:30 p.m.</h3>

    <div class="uk-accordion-content">

        
        
        
                <div class="uk-margin"><strong><p style="border: 1px solid #80BC00; padding: 10px; text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.uab.edu/humanresources/home/wfgroups">The following announcement describes the university’s re-entry plan. The Health System is on a separate plan to transition from the Limited Business Model and began resuming clinical operations in early May.</a> </p></strong>

<p>
On Tuesday, May 26, UAB will transition from the university’s Limited Business Model into Modified Business Operations. During Modified Business Operations, UAB will begin a gradual, phased approach with some groups/functions returning to campus before others. </p>
<p>
It is important to gradually bring individuals back on campus to promote social distancing. This phased approach will also allow us to evaluate strategies for effectiveness and minimize risk. </p>
<p>
<strong>Only *students, faculty and staff who are part of an approved unit operational plan will be permitted to return to campus during this phase and will be responsible for strictly following safety guidelines and requirements in place to minimize potential risk. Clinical and research personnel will be the first to return to campus following the approval of units’ operational plans.</strong></p>
 
<p><em>*Students: Students in clinical areas must receive approval from their program to return to campus. Researchers at post-doctoral and graduate/pre-doctoral levels may continue or initiate studies on site following approved unit operational plans to ensure the safe return to campus. Other trainees engaged in research, such as undergraduate students and volunteers, must request approval through the <a href="https://www.uab.edu/coronavirus/images/documents/reentry/r2ops-operational-plan-template-undergraduates.doc">Office of Research exception process</a>.</em></p>
<p>
UAB is fortunate to have extensive expertise in several disciplines that was utilized on UAB and University of Alabama System task forces to craft well-informed re-entry strategies guided by five principles:</p>
<ol>
<li>Preserve the health of our university community and Birmingham.</li>
<li>Maintain and deliver on our education, research and community engagement by continuing to recruit and enroll students, teach those students, conduct research, and help stimulate the Alabama economy.</li>
<li>Preserve and maintain university operations necessary to support mission-critical activities, both now and into the future.</li>
<li>Treat students and employees fairly and equitably.</li>
<li>Remain fiscally solvent now and into the future so as to be able to deliver on mission-critical activities for the long term.</li>
</ol>
<p>
Detailed plans and guidance to minimize risk and promote quality outcomes across all mission pillars are available at <a href="http://www.uab.edu/reentry">uab.edu/reentry</a> and cover many areas:
<ul>
<li>Required web-based training (as soon as available; in development)</li>
<li>Symptom and exposure tracking and contact tracing (as soon as available; in development) 
<li>COVID-19 testing</li> 
<li>Guidance for high-risk individuals</li>
<li>Phased staffing plans and staffing options </li>
<li>Personal protective equipment (including masks/face coverings, gloves, etc.)</li>
<li>Social distancing</li>
<li>Hygiene (handwashing, hand sanitizers, cough/sneeze etiquette)</li>
<li>Public transportation/Blazer Express  </li>
<li>Enhanced environmental health and cleaning procedures</li>
<li>Protocols in offices, reception areas, elevators, labs, classrooms, outdoor areas, etc.</li>
<li>Mental and emotional well-being</li>
<li>Enter/Exit control</li>
</ul>
<p>
Guidance and requirements are subject to change and will be updated prior to future phases of re-entry, including a return to in-person instruction. </p>

<h3>
    Anticipated Phased Approach Timeline
</h3>
<p>We anticipate restrictions and limitations in activities will be in place for the next 12 to 18 months. After evaluating several factors, including the trending numbers of new COVID-19 cases in our community, our testing capability and availability, our ability to monitor the spread of the virus in the campus community, the adequacy of community health care resources, current supply levels of personal protective equipment, and applicable federal, state and local directives, we developed the following color code system to coordinate and integrate operational procedures across UAB. </p>
<p>
The active color code will be determined based upon state, local or UA System restrictions and conditions. Changes in the prevailing code will be announced by UAB leadership in response to the changing circumstances. Each level defines a different set of work criteria rules and regulations and operational plans.</p>

<p>The COVID-19 pandemic is a dynamic situation that continues to evolve, and our response will inevitably evolve as well. We will therefore update these guidelines and the protocols outlined below as necessary to continue to ensure the health and safety of the campus community. As of mid-May, we are working toward implementing guidelines for the Yellow/Modified Business Operations level as research and clinical activities resume.  </p>

<h3>
    Productivity in Modified Business Operations 
</h3>
<p>In March, UAB — in partnership with the University of Alabama System — announced a Limited Business Model to slow the spread of COVID-19. In the initial phase of Limited Business, staff in <a href="https://www.uab.edu/humanresources/home/wfgroups">Workgroups A (academic staff) and C (clinical staff)</a> were assigned to one of three sub-groups:</p>
<ul>
<li>Group 1: Needed to continue work in-person</li>
<li>Group 2: Needed to continue work but can do so remotely</li>
<li>Group 3: Not needed to work during a time of limited business </li>
</ul>

<p><em>Note: <a href="file:///C:/Users/computer/AppData/Local/Packages/Microsoft.MicrosoftEdge_8wekyb3d8bbwe/TempState/Downloads/USE THE EMPLOYEE WORKFORCE APP TO CHECK YOUR WORKGROUP">Workgroup assignments (i.e., A, C, F) can be checked via the UAB Employee Workforce App online.</a> Subgroup assignments (i.e., 1, 2, 3) are determined by an employee’s unit leadership/supervisor.</em></p>

<p>During the initial eight-week phase of Limited Business, employees — even those who could not work — continued to receive regular compensation while the financial and operational impact of COVID-19 was assessed. As Limited Business was prolonged, we could not continue to pay employees who could not work. </p>

<p>Effective May 10, all staff in <a href="https://www.uab.edu/humanresources/home/wfgroups">Workgroup A</a> Group 3 and a limited number of staff in <a href="https://www.uab.edu/humanresources/home/wfgroups">Workgroup A</a> Group 2 were placed on temporary furlough (May 10-July 31). Furloughed individuals are those who — by the nature of their work — could not do their jobs remotely or who serve in roles for which demand decreased or would decrease to a critical point during the furlough period. Some units exercised discretion and addressed unit-specific budget shortfalls by placing additional staff on furlough status who had worked effectively during the Limited Business model. No UAB Medicine staff in <a href="https://www.uab.edu/humanresources/home/wfgroups">Workgroup C</a> were placed on furlough due to the anticipated return to clinical operations as the hospital and clinics reopen. </p>

<p>As a result of furloughs effective May 10, remaining <a href="https://www.uab.edu/humanresources/home/wfgroups">Workgroup A</a> staff are those who can work effectively during Modified Business Operations according to their supervisor. As such, non-furloughed staff in <a href="https://www.uab.edu/humanresources/home/wfgroups">Workgroup A</a> are expected to maintain a state of full productivity in Modified Business Operations. Employees with questions are encouraged to ask their designated Human Resources representative. </p>

<h3>
    Next Steps
</h3>
<p>Individuals who have responsibilities described within each of the phases and are anticipated to return to campus, and their supervisors, will be contacted with specific guidance as soon as possible, and updates and information will continue to be added to <a href="http://www.uab.edu/coronavirus">uab.edu/coronavirus</a> and <a href="http://www.uab.edu/reentry">uab.edu/reentry</a>.

    <h3 class="uk-accordion-title"><span id="reduction">Update on COVID-19: Additional Expense Reductions Due to COVID-19 Crisis</span> Monday, May 4 at 12:30 p.m.</h3>

    <div class="uk-accordion-content">

        
        
        
                <div class="uk-margin">

<p>
    UAB faculty and staff,</p><p>

UAB is experiencing the harsh financial realities of the COVID-19 pandemic, as are institutions of higher education and health care worldwide. 
</p><p>
The Universities of Arizona, Kentucky, Louisville, Ohio, Oregon and Wisconsin recently joined a growing number of universities and academic medical centers to announce some combination of salary reductions, furloughs or reduced hours, layoffs, and stopping employer contributions to retirement plans. Washington University in St. Louis furloughed 1,300 employees for 90 days. The Mayo Clinic announced it would furlough or reduce hours for 30,000 employees. 
</p><p>
Many revenue streams have slowed or stopped due to the pandemic. Clinical revenue is substantially down for UAB Medicine. For the university, social distancing and other operational changes have negatively affected revenue. Without changes to our operations, the university will incur a budget shortfall of $40+ million in the remaining five months of the FY20 fiscal year ending Sept. 30, and UAB Medicine could have a $230 million budget shortfall by the end of September. Federal and state stimulus funding will address only a portion of our losses.
</p><p>
To protect our employees and the institution, beginning in March we took quick steps in partnership with the University of Alabama System to limit travel and restrict hiring and discretionary spending, among other strategies. To date, the university and UAB Medicine have been able to largely sustain uninterrupted payroll for more than seven weeks of limited business while we assessed the extent of the pandemic’s financial impact. Despite our best efforts, we must take additional actions we had hoped to avoid and delayed as long as possible. 
</p><p>
University leadership explored many options with advisory panels across campus, including Faculty Senate and Staff Council leaders, the University’s Budget Advisory Committee, and others to determine what expense reduction options should be adopted. UAB Medicine gathered input from leaders across the organization and its governing bodies to determine expense-reduction strategies.  
</p><p>
After thorough assessment and projections, we regret to announce additional university and UAB Medicine expense-reduction strategies. 
</p><p>
<strong>University Leadership Salary Reductions 
</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Effective May 1, university leadership had their salaries reduced for at least the remainder of the fiscal year as follows:  President 15%, Senior Vice Presidents 10%, Deans and Vice Presidents 7%</li></ul>

<p><strong>UAB Medicine Leadership Salary Reductions</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>UAB Medicine Senior Leaders (Including Department Chairs): 10% reduction in annual compensation, effective May 10 through Dec. 31, 2020 </li>
<li>Health System Executive Cabinet: 15% reduction in annual compensation, effective May 10 through Dec. 31, 2020 </li>
</ul>

<p>
    <strong>In addition, the university and UAB Medicine/Health System-managed entities must implement different responses to address budget shortfalls for their separate lines of business. </strong></p><p>

</p>

<a href="https://www.uab.edu/humanresources/home/wfgroups">USE THE EMPLOYEE WORKFORCE APP TO CHECK YOUR WORKGROUP
</a></h4>

<h3>
    University Expense Reduction Strategies
    </h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>Temporary furloughs for approximately 325 university staff unable to work effectively in a remote setting, for a period effective May 10 through July 31, 2020:</strong></li><ul>
<li>Temporary furloughs will affect Workgroup A Group 3 and a limited number of university staff in <a href="https://www.uab.edu/humanresources/home/wfgroups">Workgroup A</a> Group 2. Human Resources will work with supervisors to identify and alert affected Group 2 staff as soon as possible and no later than the end of business Friday, May 8. </li>
<li>During furlough, employees retain benefits such as health insurance and are eligible for unemployment benefits and additional assistance through the CARES Act. UAB will cover the cost of both the employer and employee contributions to health plans (including employee premiums) for affected staff during the furlough period. </li>
<li><a href="https://uab.edu/humanresources/home/covid-19-resources/furlough-resources">Information for furloughed university employees is available online.</a> Employees can also contact their designated HR representative. </li>
<li>UAB HR will file claims for unemployment benefits with the Alabama Department of Labor on behalf of furloughed staff. </li>
<li>The furlough period might be shorter or longer depending on the evolving impact of the pandemic.   </li>
</ul> </ul>

<h3>Strategies for UAB Medicine/Health System-managed Entities 
    
    </h3>
<li><strong>Temporary salary reductions for many clinical faculty and <a href="https://www.uab.edu/humanresources/home/wfgroups">Workgroup C</a> staff in UAB Medicine and Health System-managed entities:</strong> </li>
<ul><li><a href="https://www.uab.edu/humanresources/home/wfgroups">Workgroup C</a> salary reductions are effective May 10 through Dec. 31, 2020. Implementation dates for School of Medicine clinical department faculty may vary slightly and will be directly communicated to those affected.</li>
<li>School of Medicine clinical department faculty salary reductions will average 7%. Specific salary reductions for <a href="https://www.uab.edu/humanresources/home/wfgroups">Workgroup C</a> will be implemented on the following sliding scale:</li>
<ul><li>Hourly wage employees making $15 or less per hour: 0% reduction in annual compensation </li>
<li>$0 – $31,200: 0% reduction in annual compensation</li>
<li>$31,201 – $50,000: 3% reduction in annual compensation</li>
<li>$50,001 – $75,000: 4% reduction in annual compensation</li>

<strong>Thank you for all you have done and continue to do for our mission during this time.</strong> These actions are a reflection only of the harsh economic realities of the COVID-19 crisis, not a reflection of the value of UAB faculty and staff or their job performance. We are disappointed that this action has become necessary. 
</p><p>
We will continue to assess the crisis. Future decisions will be determined by the financial realities of the time as we work to reverse financial deficits and fight this COVID-19 pandemic.

Those of you who need to take advantage of resources like the Benevolent Fund’s <a href="https://www.uab.edu/benfund/support/eeap">Employee Emergency Assistance program</a> or <a href="https://www.uab.edu/benfund/blazer-kitchen">Blazer Kitchen</a>, please do.

    <h3 class="uk-accordion-title"><span id="financial">Update on COVID-19: Financial Process, 403(b) and Fall Semester</span> Thursday, April 30 at 12:30 p.m.</h3>

    <div class="uk-accordion-content">

        
        
        
                <div class="uk-margin"><p>
    UAB Faculty and Staff,</p><p>
 
As April comes to a close, questions remain about UAB’s plans to address the financial realities of the COVID-19 crisis and plans for the fall semester.</p><p>
 
Our hope is to offer in-person instruction options in the fall – a goal we are working towards with the guidance of task forces at the UA System and UAB levels. While circumstances could ultimately limit our ability, we are working to determine the logistics that would facilitate a safe return to campus.</p><p>
 
Financially, UAB is still working through the process shared with the campus community recently. In an <a href="https://www.uab.edu/reporter/campus/take-note/item/9096-putting-people-first-the-latest-on-re-opening-campus-confronting-budget-challenges-and-more?utm_source=MC_100006781&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=200430+-+Coronavirus+-+Email&utm_content=https%3a%2f%2fwww.uab.edu%2freporter%2fcampus%2ftake-note%2fitem%2f9096-putting-people-first-the-latest-on-re-opening-campus-confronting-budget-challenges-and-more">April 16 virtual town hall</a> for faculty and staff, Vice President Allen Bolton explained the initial estimated negative impact on our budget to be between $52 million and $77 million this fiscal year. UAB Medicine has projected a possible $230 million budget shortfall by the end of September.</p><p>
 
UAB leaders have been exploring many expense reduction options with advisory panels across campus, including Faculty Senate and Staff Council leaders, the University’s Budget Advisory Committee and others to determine what options should be adopted to close that gap.
 </p><p>
<strong>At this time, employer matches/contributions to voluntary 403(b) retirement plans will be temporarily suspended or reduced in accordance with the requirements of the plans. For university employees, this will start in May and last through September 2020. Because the health system has a larger budget shortfall than the university, it will also start this action in May but will extend it through December 2020. Details will be communicated directly with individuals who participate in these plans.</strong></p><p>
 
We continue to work on a comprehensive plan in coordination with UAB Medicine that should be final no later than next week. The good news is, due to new information and projections this week, our projected budget shortfall is several million dollars less than originally estimated. This is positive, allowing us to revisit the extent of expense reduction options needed in addition to our hiring and spending restrictions already in place.
 </p><p>
It remains our goal to minimize the disruption to our valued faculty and staff, which is why we have taken the appropriate time to ensure that estimates are accurate and actions we ultimately take are absolutely necessary. As we assess strategies, we are thoughtfully considering the timing of any announcement. 
 </p><p>
Our work to finalize a comprehensive plan continues, and we will keep you informed as soon as we have new information. Thank you for all of your efforts on behalf of our multifaceted mission.
 </p><p>
Sincerely, 
Ray L. Watts
President, UAB

<p>
    I want to thank President Ray Watts, Dr. Will Ferniany, Provost Pam Benoit, Dr. Selwyn Vickers and the faculty and the staff who are working tirelessly during these difficult times to provide meaningful support and uninterrupted teaching to students at the University of Alabama at Birmingham. </p><p>
  
The entire UA System – UA, UAB, UAH and the UAB Health System – is committed to using all possible resources to reopen our campuses and resume normal activities.  It is not a matter of <strong>IF</strong>, but one of <strong>WHEN</strong>. </p><p>

We are extremely fortunate that UAB, home to one of the world’s foremost academic medical centers, is part of our System.  With knowledge and guidance from the scientists, doctors, researchers and numerous higher education experts on our campuses, we are developing comprehensive plans to make sure our three campuses are <strong>the safest in America</strong> when our students return. </p><p>

We have established a System-wide Task Force to consider strategies of all kinds: testing measures, enhanced cleaning, classroom procedures, housing policies, security and wellness programs, and more.  We will update you about timelines on our website (<a href="http://www.uasystem.edu/">www.uasystem.edu</a>) and through future email communication from the UAB leadership team.

                <div class="uk-margin"><p>
    UAB students, faculty and staff,</p><p>
 
Thank you all for your hard work and understanding in this time of change and uncertainty.  Your Blazer spirit is essential to keeping our UAB community safe and to ensuring our ability to serve and educate effectively. </p><p>
 
As part of the University of Alabama System Office’s 24/7 planning to safeguard our campus community, it has developed an <a href="http://uasystem.edu/assets/2020/04/Policy-Update-Summer-Term-20200408.pdf" target="_blank">Updated Interim Emergency Policy regarding summer classes</a>. Given that the majority of our summer courses offered after June 22 have already transitioned to an online format, we will <strong>not</strong> offer in-person/on-site classes for summer 2020. All instruction will be delivered remotely using the most effective tools available. </p><p>

Students, please work with your faculty members to access materials and utilize all the teaching and learning tools we have posted for you. Although classes are not being taught in person this spring or summer, our faculty is delivering a full array of courses through remote teaching. This <a href="/coronavirus/info-for-you/faculty/#summer-2020-semester-faqs">FAQ</a> provides important details regarding laboratories, in-person research, residence halls and campus dining, in addition to grading methods and other important updates.</p><p>
 
As we have previously announced, we will not hold in-person orientations or commencement ceremonies until further notice. We have online programming prepared for both. All of you who look forward to participating in a future graduation ceremony on campus will have that opportunity as soon as on-campus operations are restored and scheduled.
 </p><p>
We remain committed to delivering on our mission, vision and shared values to create knowledge that will change the world.

    UAB was notified this afternoon that a campus community member tested positive for COVID-19 today, March 31, 2020. The safety and well-being of the community is UAB's top priority, so we are providing this notification out of an abundance of caution. It is important to note that the vast majority of the campus community has been working and learning remotely. </p><p>

State and local health departments have protocols for testing and advising cases – including contact tracing and notifying individuals who may have been exposed. Public health authorities determine what information is shared publicly in the interest of health and in accordance with privacy requirements.

<li>Faculty (<a href="https://www.uab.edu/humanresources/home/wfgroups">Workgroup F</a>) involved in activities that require a presence at their work location (e.g., patient care or essential research) should continue to report to their place of work.

If you have questions, consult your supervisor.</li>
<li>For guidance on research activities, please see <a href="/coronavirus/info-for-you/researchers">Resources for Researchers on uab.edu/coronavirus</a>. </li>
<li>UAB Hospital never closes and continues to prepare to safely isolate and care for COVID-19 patients.
</li></ul></strong>
<p>
    UAB faculty and staff (including student/employee workers),</p><p>

We often say UAB’s people are our most valuable resource, and we sincerely thank you for all you do for UAB and our community in this challenging time. We continue to monitor the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic and carefully plan in an attempt to minimize disruptions while maintaining critical functions in a safe environment. </p><p>

As you know, UAB announced an initial 14-day limited business model in mid-March for <a href="https://www.uab.edu/humanresources/home/wfgroups">Workgroups A and C</a>. <strong>We are now extending the duration of the limited business model — as it is now — for <a href="https://www.uab.edu/humanresources/home/wfgroups">Workgroups A and C</a> until or unless notified otherwise by their supervisor.</strong> </p><p>

All employees who are working remotely, or unable to perform their jobs remotely, will continue under the same conditions and circumstances as previously announced – including pay and benefits.  We will continue to update and inform you of any changes to this policy, and your supervisor will notify you of any changes to your work group, taking into account the need to stagger campus visit times and <a href="/coronavirus/social-distancing">maintain social distancing</a> at all times.  
</p><p>
As a reminder, the categories of employees in Limited Business Model <a href="https://www.uab.edu/humanresources/home/wfgroups">Workgroup A and C</a> are (employees are assigned to the appropriate group by their unit leadership/supervisor and should follow supervisor instructions): </p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://www.uab.edu/humanresources/home/wfgroups">Workgroup A and C</a>, Group 1: Those who will continue work in-person and continue to be paid at the normal rate. <strong>Do not come to work if you are sick, and continue to practice social distancing and good hygiene.</strong></li>
<ul>
<li>Supervisors should make every effort <strong>to not include student-employees in Workgroup A or C, Group 1 on-campus work</strong>. If a supervisor thinks a student’s role is essential, approval must be granted by HR before a student is assigned to Workgroup A or C, Group 1. </li>    
    </ul>
<li><a href="https://www.uab.edu/humanresources/home/wfgroups">Workgroup A and C</a>, Group 2: Those who will continue work but can do so from home and continue to be paid at the normal rate.</li>
<ul>
 <li>Read UAB’s <a href="https://www.uab.edu/news/images/2018/images/covid19/GUIDELINES_FOR_TEMPORARY_TELECOMMUTING.pdf">temporary telecommuting guidance</a> and fill out and <a href="https://powerforms.docusign.net/58ce1541-732a-4a7e-90a2-fe19420c3a6e?env=na3-eu1&amp;acct=097de7a9-05d2-49f4-9572-521df6d32f4a">sign the telecommuting agreement</a> if you have not already. If you completed a telecommuting agreement for the initial 14-day limited business phase, you <strong>do not</strong> need to fill it out a second time. </li>
<li>Working from home can be challenging. For the short- and long-term health of our institution and our vital mission, managing those challenges to remain productive is imperative. Communicate with your supervisor and/or speak with your Human Resources representative for guidance. </li>
<li>Your group assignment is subject to change if business needs arise. </li>   
    </ul>
<li><a href="https://www.uab.edu/humanresources/home/wfgroups">Workgroup A and C</a>, Group 3: Those who will not work during a time of limited business and will continue to receive normal pay and benefits until or unless notified otherwise by their supervisor.   </li><ul>
<li>Unfortunately, the COVID-19 pandemic makes it necessary to limit on-campus personnel to only those whose functions are imperative during limited business operations — and not all functions can be done remotely or are required under extreme circumstances.  </li>
<li><a href="https://www.uab.edu/humanresources/home/wfgroups">Workgroup A and C</a>, Group 3, may be called upon to perform duties (on-site or remotely) within the employee’s skill set but outside of the employee’s job description.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.uab.edu/humanresources/home/wfgroups">Workgroup A and C</a>, Group 3 employees will continue to be paid during the limited business period until or unless notified otherwise by their supervisor. In the event of a prolonged disruption that requires this policy to change, leadership will work with all sources (federal, state, etc.) in an effort to continue financial support of our employees. UAB is <a href="https://www.uab.edu/fightcovid19/give" target="_blank">raising funds to help those affected by COVID-19</a>. Students in need of assistance can request a COVID-19 <a href="https://padlock.idm.uab.edu/cas/login?service=https%3A%2F%2Fcm.maxient.com%2Freportingform.php%3FUnivofAlabamaBirmingham%26layout_id%3D16">emergency grant</a>. Employees in need of assistance can pursue the <a href="https://www.uab.edu/benfund/support/eeap">Employee Emergency Assistance Program</a>.</li>
<li>If you need to go to campus to get critical personal belongings, coordinate with your supervisor for approval and to stagger timing with others to minimize personal contact. Absolutely do not go to campus if you are sick.  </li>
<li>Your group assignment is subject to change if business needs arise. </li></ul>
</ol>
<em><strong><p>
NOTE: Unit leaders/supervisors will assign and communicate group assignments within Workgroup A and C.</p></strong></em><p>

Employment and pay for Federal Work Study students will be handled per current federal guidance.</p><p>

UAB — working within the framework of the <a href="http://uasystem.edu/news/2020/02/ua-system-covid-19-updates/">proactive COVID-19 planning led by The University of Alabama System</a> — will maintain health and safety as our top priority. We are committed to making prudent decisions and communicating regularly.</p><p>

Please take care of yourself and each other as much as possible.

 </p></strong>
<p>Students, faculty and staff,</p><p>

 
Thank you for your efforts to minimize the spread of novel coronavirus (COVID-19). In the midst of an extremely unsettling time, the Blazer community has come together to make sacrifices and support one another. Please continue to <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prepare/prevention.html">practice aggressive social distancing and good hygiene</a> so we can “<a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2020/03/13/815502262/flattening-a-pandemics-curve-why-staying-home-now-can-save-lives">flatten the curve</a>” and save lives.</p><p>
When we announced the online/alternative instruction format March 12, it was unclear how long it would last. It is now clear that in-person instruction will not be possible for the remainder of the semester.</p><p>

As part of the ongoing <a href="http://uasystem.edu/ua-system-coronavirus-information-and-resources/">University of Alabama System Office planning</a> to safeguard our campus community, UAB and our sister campuses are announcing today that there will be <strong>no more in-person/on-site classes for the duration of the spring semester</strong>. Instead of on-campus commencement ceremonies this spring, UAB will host virtual/alternative commencement ceremonies.  </p><p>
 
This is an unprecedented situation, but UAB remains committed to minimizing disruptions while keeping health and safety our top priority. Additional logistics will be communicated in the coming days, but here are details we know now:</p><p>
 
</p><h3>Online and Alternative Teaching
    </h3><p>
The UAB spring semester will resume Wednesday, March 25, in an <strong>online/alternative format</strong>. All instruction will be delivered remotely using the most effective tools available. Students should work with their instructors to access materials and utilize <a href="https://www.uab.edu/elearning/students">resources</a>, an <a href="/coronavirus/info-for-you/undergraduate-students#online-remote-learning-faqs">online FAQ</a> and <a href="https://www.uab.edu/reporter/know-more/teaching-learning/item/9067-tips-for-success-from-experienced-online-students">guidance</a> to help them succeed in this format. Faculty have been provided <a href="https://www.uab.edu/elearning/faculty/teachingremote?utm_source=MC_100006781&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=200310+-+Coronavirus+-+Faculty+-+Online+Prep+Site&amp;utm_content=this+site">eLearning</a> and <a href="https://www.uab.edu/it/home/remote-work">IT resources</a>, as well as <a href="https://www.uab.edu/reporter/know-more/teaching-learning/item/9061-online-teaching-veterans-share-their-top-tips">peer guidance</a>. Policies regarding clinical and research requirements, student-teacher programs and other specific professional programs will be formulated based on guidance from the state of Alabama and the appropriate academic departments and governing agencies.</p><p>
 
</p><h3>Virtual/Alternative Commencement Ceremonies</h3><p>

We are deeply disappointed that our graduating Blazers will not experience a traditional commencement this spring, but we will do everything we can to recognize and celebrate your accomplishments. There are several commencement ceremonies each spring, and details of each virtual/alternative commencement will be communicated in the coming days and weeks. This announcement is being made now to best accommodate the logistics of graduating students and their families, as well as campus departments. Additional information about this and other opportunities will be provided.</p><p>
 
</p><h3>Residence Halls</h3><p>

Now that we know on-campus instruction will not take place this semester, we can begin to make decisions and provide guidance to allow students to move out of their residence hall rooms. We are formulating a plan now to allow a systematic and safe way for students to retrieve their belongings and move out. <strong>This plan will be shared in a separate communication directly to residential students.</strong> 
 
Students, please <strong>DO NOT RETURN TO CAMPUS</strong> at this time. <strong>It remains vitally important to aggressively promote social distancing and “<a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2020/03/13/815502262/flattening-a-pandemics-curve-why-staying-home-now-can-save-lives">flatten the curve</a>.”</strong> Students should email <span id="cloak104c74d47b3fc044b70f8631543ea175">This email address is being protected from spambots.

		</script> if an extreme hardship or circumstance arises. Students are not authorized to return to campus outside of this plan, and any who show up without authorization will not be accommodated. </p>

<strong><p style="border: 1px solid #80BC00; padding: 10px; text-align: center;">UAB is complex. Changes to work schedules mean different things to employees and can be confusing. If you have questions about the following guidance, please ask your supervisor or HR contact. </p></strong>


<p>
 
 
UAB faculty and staff (including student employees/workers),</p><p>
 
Late Friday, a state of emergency was declared for Alabama and the nation to address the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. This announcement — which includes the closing of K-12 schools statewide starting Wednesday at 5 p.m. and relaxing absentee policies in some schools for the beginning of the week — has prompted concerns and questions about UAB policies that address remote work, essential staffing and child care issues.</p><p>
 
With guidance from Human Resources, leaders across the university have been working to assess resources and staffing needs, and will be moving to a limited business model. <strong>Based on the latest COVID-19 developments and the need to minimize in-person contact, UAB (university) will begin transitioning to a limited business model for employees in <a href="https://www.uab.edu/humanresources/home/wfgroups">Workgroup A</a> starting Monday, March 16, to be fully implemented by 5 p.m. The limited business model will be in place for at least 14 days starting March 17.</strong></p><p>
 
<strong>Again, the following information about a limited business model applies ONLY to <a href="https://www.uab.edu/humanresources/home/wfgroups">Workgroup A</a>. Faculty (<a href="https://www.uab.edu/humanresources/home/wfgroups">Workgroup F</a>) are asked to work remotely IF POSSIBLE (e.g., if you are instructing online, do so from your home, not campus), and come to campus only if required (e.g., direct patient care or research responsibilities that require a physical presence on campus). If you have questions, consult with your supervisor. Instructions and updates for employees in <a href="https://www.uab.edu/humanresources/home/wfgroups">Workgroup C</a> and those at Children’s of Alabama will be forthcoming from the UAB Health System and School of Medicine.</strong></p><p>
 
This limited business model identifies employees in <a href="https://www.uab.edu/humanresources/home/wfgroups">Workgroup A</a> who are:
</p><ul>
<li>needed to continue work in-person (Limited Business Model Workgroup A, Group 1)</li>
<li>needed to continue work but can do so from home (Limited Business Model Workgroup A, Group 2)</li>
<li>not needed to work during a time of limited business (Limited Business Model Workgroup A, Group 3)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong><em>NOTE: Unit leaders/supervisors will assign and communicate group assignments within Workgroup A.</em></strong></p><p>
Early data suggests a limited business model may reduce the presence of on-site university employees by as much as 75 percent while maintaining functions critical to the UAB mission. It is important to remember that UAB Hospital never closes and continues to prepare to safely isolate and care for COVID-19 patients.</p><p>

At this time, a limited business model is in the best interests of the health and safety of our students, faculty and staff, and is an important community service to minimize COVID-19 spread. <strong>During this time, it is vital that everyone in every group practices aggressive and meaningful <a href="/coronavirus/social-distancing">social distancing, as well as proper hygiene</a> to avoid contracting or spreading COVID-19.</strong> If you experience symptoms, call before you go to the doctor. Please call <a href="https://www.uab.edu/humanresources/home/employeehealth">Employee Health</a> or call <a href="https://www.uabmedicine.org/4you">UAB Medicine 4YOU</a> at 205-934-9999.</p>
 
<h4>
 How will limited business operations work?   
</h4><p>
Employees are assigned to the appropriate group by their unit leadership/supervisor and should follow supervisor instructions. </p><p>
<strong>Workgroup A, Group 1 will report to work as normal; Workgroup A, Group 2 will stay home and continue to work; and Workgroup A, Group 3 will not work. Supervisors determine which positions and employees are suitable for telecommuting, not the individual employees themselves.</strong>
 
</p><ul>
<li><strong>Workgroup A, Group 1</strong> will report to work as normal <strong>(unless you are sick or have been in immediate contact with a person known to have COVID-19 — see <a href="/coronavirus/info-for-you/faculty/#employee-health-faqs">employee coronavirus health resources</a>).</strong></li><ul>
<li>Maintain <a href="/coronavirus/social-distancing">social distance and good hygiene</a>. Utilize phone calls and virtual meetings as much as possible (even for small groups). Any gatherings of more than 25 people will require approval from a dean, vice president or AVP.</li>
<li>Supervisors should make every effort to <strong>not include student-employees in Workgroup A, Group 1 for on-campus work</strong>. If a supervisor thinks a student’s role is essential, approval must be granted by HR before a student is assigned to Workgroup A, Group 1.</li></ul>
<li><strong>Workgroup A, Group 2</strong> will stay home and continue to work (as soon as possible but in effect no later than 5 p.m. Monday, March 16). If you do not need to return to campus, don’t. Also, <strong>do not return to campus if you are sick. See <a href="/coronavirus/info-for-you/faculty/#employee-health-faqs">employee coronavirus health resources</a> for guidance if you think you may have symptoms.</strong></li><ul>
<li>If needed, Monday, March 16, can be used to prepare to effectively work from home. If you need to go to campus to get essential items (e.g., laptop or desktop computer, supplies) to make working from home possible, coordinate with your supervisor to stagger coming to campus with others to limit contact with others.</li>
<li>Carefully read the <a href="https://www.uab.edu/news/images/2018/images/covid19/GUIDELINES_FOR_TEMPORARY_TELECOMMUTING.pdf">UAB Temporary Telecommuting Guidance</a>, sign the <a href="https://powerforms.docusign.net/58ce1541-732a-4a7e-90a2-fe19420c3a6e?env=na3-eu1&amp;acct=097de7a9-05d2-49f4-9572-521df6d32f4a">Temporary Telecommuting Agreement</a> and send to your supervisor (scan or digital photo is OK), then forward to your HR representative.</li><br>
</ul><ul>
    
    
<strong>The temporary telecommuting agreement and guidelines</strong> were established as part of UAB’s efforts to support business continuity across campus. They are temporary and should not be confused with UAB’s standard telecommuting agreement and guidelines. Highlights of the agreement include:
<ul>
<li>Supervisors determine which positions and employees are suitable for telecommuting, not the individual employees themselves.</li>
<li>The temporary telecommuting agreement can be modified or terminated at any time, especially if operational needs warrant the change. </li>
<li>Employees should understand obligations regarding securing UAB records and transmitting information (e.g., sensitive information related to student records, patient privacy, intellectual property, etc.).</li>
<li>Employees are responsible for establishing an appropriate work environment, meeting productivity and service goals required by management, keeping and reporting time worked, and communicating in the appropriate manner and frequency.</li><br>
</ul></ul>
    <ul>
        
<li><strong>Rather than forwarding your work phone to your cellphone, please change your outgoing voicemail message on your work phone to instruct callers to call your cellphone directly. This will alleviate capacity constraints we would face if too many work phones are forwarded.</strong> </li>
<li>Utilize available resources to set up remote working capabilities.</li><ul>

<br><em>Working from home can be challenging. For the short- and long-term health of our institution and our vital mission, managing those challenges to remain productive is imperative. Communicate with your supervisor and/or speak with your Human Resources representative for guidance.</em>
 <p>
</p><ul><li><strong>Workgroup A, Group 3</strong> will not work (after being notified of your group assignment by your supervisor).
<ul>
<li>Unfortunately, the COVID-19 pandemic makes it necessary to limit on-campus personnel to only those whose functions are imperative during limited business operations — and not all functions can be done remotely or are required under extreme circumstances.    </li>
<li>Workgroup A, Group 3 employees will be paid during the initial 14-day limited business period. In the event of a prolonged disruption, leadership will work with all sources (federal, state, etc.) in an effort to continue financial support of our employees. Further, UAB Leadership is exploring opportunities — including possible use of the Benevolent Fund — to financially help employees who encounter hardships due to the suspension of work IF limited business lasts longer than two weeks.</li>

 The fast-moving and dynamic nature of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak has led to many uncertainties and questions. This is not unique to UAB, universities or health systems. We are glad the <a href="http://uasystem.edu/updated-interim-emergency-policy-for-ua-uab-and-uah/">University of Alabama System took decisive action as part of a proactive planning process</a> to promote health and safety on our campus.
</p><p>


As we work to operationalize the change, we may not have all the answers immediately. But a very dedicated team is committed to reducing uncertainties as much and as quickly as possible. <strong>Ultimately, we want to minimize disruption to the lives of our campus community while keeping health and safety our top priority.</strong></p><p>

 
A great deal of planning has taken place, and many questions have been answered. Please take the time to review the information that is available – including resources, communications and frequently asked questions – at <a href="http://www.uab.edu/coronavirus">www.uab.edu/coronavirus</a>.

<p>
As you know, we are shifting to online and alternative learning after spring break. Additional preparations are underway as we monitor the outbreak. <strong>Business operations are being maintained at this time (i.e., faculty and staff are asked to report to work), but we may need to make additional adjustments in the interest of health and safety.</strong> At this time, student workers/employees/interns who remain on campus and want to continue working may be able to maintain their normal work schedule. Managers are asked to be understanding of student-employees’ circumstances. Ultimately, circumstances will vary, and student-employees should speak with their supervisor/coordinating instructor who can consult leadership on a case-by-case basis as necessary.
</p><p>
In the event normal business operations are altered, Human Resources is working with leaders across campus to explore – for example – job functions that can take place in a remote setting off campus to promote social distancing.
 </p><p>

In the meantime, units on campus are encouraged to test remote working capabilities on a limited basis with some faculty and staff working from home to help identify challenges and opportunities, should a more comprehensive limited business plan be implemented. <a href="https://www.uab.edu/humanresources/home/images/Forms/Telecommuting-Agreement_5-27-16.pdf">UAB Telecommuting Agreement</a>
 </p><p>

Logistical changes – including limiting access to some facilities and closing some university functions – are being considered and will be communicated as soon as details are clear. While student access will be limited, all academic buildings will remain open to faculty and staff.
 </p><p>

   Based on recent developments, discussions with leadership on University of Alabama System campuses and with other institutions, and advice of the University of Alabama System Task Force, <a href="http://uasystem.edu/news/2020/02/ua-system-covid-19-updates/" target="_blank">the UA System is making <strong>immediate preparations</strong> to transition to on-line or alternate instruction for all academic courses</a> to protect the health and safety of our communities. This policy will be re-evaluated on or before <strong>Monday, April 6, 2020.</strong></p>
<p>Each campus will keep faculty, staff and students updated electronically on individualized plans, timelines and specific changes as soon as possible. </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>UAB is scheduled for Spring Break the week of March 16-20.</strong><strong></strong> <strong>UAB’s Spring Break will be extended through at least March 24.</strong> Each campus will notify students, faculty and staff when the semester will resume. </li>

<li>Following Spring Break, UAB students should <strong>not</strong> return to campus and will continue their course work via distance learning subject to the following limited exceptions: </li><ul>
    <li>international or other students who do not have alternative accommodations; </li>
<li>students from areas without high-speed internet or other means of receiving remote instruction; </li>
<li>students with exceptional hardships, or academic, employment, clinical or research requirements that should be reviewed by the respective campuses on a case-by-case basis.  </li></ul>
    <li><strong>Arrangements will be made by the campuses to ensure any students remaining on campus have access to essential services (including Student Health Services/Counseling Services). Residence Hall and dining facilities will be open for students who remain on campus.</strong></li>
    
    <li>
    The UA System’s restriction on ALL non-essential international and domestic travel remains in place.  All non-essential University meetings, gatherings and events are cancelled. Faculty, staff and students abroad and in international affiliated programs sponsored by third parties should contact their program administrators for information and further guidance.

    Update to the UA System’s Interim Emergency Policy – Information Regarding Spring Break
</h3>
 <p>
     As are colleges and universities throughout North America, the University of Alabama System is taking precautionary measures regarding the health and safety of our students, faculty and staff.
     
</p> <p>

In preparation for the upcoming spring break March 16-20 at UA and UAB, with UAH’s break the following week (March 23-27), our <strong>current plans call for maintaining normal campus operations</strong>. Our guidance is based on the best information available to us at this time from local, state and federal agencies and health care professionals.</p> <p>

 
As you consider plans for spring break, please keep these important points in mind to protect yourself and our community from the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak.</p> <p>

 
</p><ol>
<li>Our goal is to provide continuity and consistency for our students. If the situations in our communities change, we will transition to alternative modes of instruction (such as on-line classes) to protect the health and safety of System campuses. While current plans are to maintain regular schedules, it is possible that System campuses could move to alternative modes of instruction at some point this semester depending on the state of COVID-19 in Alabama. <strong>IF</strong> it becomes necessary to cancel in-person classes, plan ahead to have what you need. When you leave for spring break, take essential belongings with you (e.g., class materials, textbooks, medications, electronics, valuables, etc.), in the event a transition to alternative modes of instruction becomes necessary.</li> <br>
<li>If you live on campus, are uncomfortable traveling, and <strong>prefer to stay</strong> on campus during spring break, we will provide you with accommodations. It is important that you notify us of your plans if you decide to remain on campus. At UAB, email <span id="cloaka19445a42deac62b9ac2d5d8c8b3be42">This email address is being protected from spambots.

<li>Everyone on our campuses should take extra care to follow personal hygiene instructions from the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/about/prevention.html?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fcoronavirus%2F2019-ncov%2Fabout%2Fprevention-treatment.html">CDC</a>:  </li> <ul>
<li>   Wash hands frequently, and avoid touching your face with unwashed hands.</li>
<li>Avoid sick people, avoid people if you are sick, and do not travel if you are sick.</li>
<li>Clean and disinfect surfaces, and cover your cough or sneeze with a sleeve or tissue.</li>
<li>Protect against the flu by getting the flu vaccine. The flu vaccine does not protect against COVID-19, but the flu is still circulating in the community at this time.</li>
<li>The CDC does not recommend the general public buy or wear masks in the United States.</li>
<li>If you have symptoms, call your health care provider BEFORE going to the doctor. </li>
    </ul><br>

<li>Continue to be vigilant, plan ahead and protect against spreading viral illness. The following two maps are available to assist you with accurate information on affected areas: </li>

<li>If you develop respiratory symptoms during spring break, or are exposed to an individual with or suspected of having COVID-19, then please DO NOT return to campus, and we will work with you to provide alternative arrangements for remote learning through the best available platforms. Students should contact their advisor or program head regarding academic concerns.</li><br>
<li>We are continuously monitoring the situation, which could change at any time. We will notify you of updated information and policy changes on the UA System’s <a href="http://uasystem.edu/news/2020/02/ua-system-covid-19-updates/">dedicated webpage</a>.</li>

We want to remind everyone to please monitor your emails. The System’s previous advisories canceling international travel and discouraging any non-essential domestic travel remain in effect.

     The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak is evolving quickly, and the outbreak has required proactive leadership from the University of Alabama System to <a href="http://click.reach.uab.edu/?qs=da21b992f59147e94e6ad885f06605dc112895330f05297b8c0cd0ed4422982b0e8b76f7853cc04bf37644ea6c56dec1b348feeeacb6d463">restrict international travel</a>.

</p><p>

There are some decisions — based on the current status of the outbreak and recent guidance from the UA System — that UAB leadership should make based on specific potential risks and circumstances. Decisions must be made regarding university-sponsored domestic travel, events and visitors to campus.
</p><p>
<strong>Any faculty or staff member sponsoring, organizing or otherwise leading university-sponsored or university-hosted travel, events or visitors should alert your leadership as soon as possible. That leader will determine if the activity is essential or non-essential, and if it poses a risk to the health and safety of the campus community:</strong>
</p><ul>
<li><strong>Non-essential Domestic Travel (<a href="http://click.reach.uab.edu/?qs=da21b992f59147e954cc5234614ba63d775a8b328d9b833e5a4423f960afa9318a917c8dc24f66fb3bfaf088df9815721b210aaa22875d27">UA System Domestic Travel Advisory</a>):</strong> Non-essential domestic travel is discouraged at this time. A decision must be made as to whether the university-sponsored domestic travel is essential or non-essential.</li>
<li><strong>Events/Visitor(s) to Campus:</strong> A decision must be made as to whether the event or visitor on campus (e.g., speakers, conferences, orientations, seminars, performances, competition) carries potential risks and whether the event/visit can take place.<p></p></li>
</ul>
Leaders responsible to make decisions in each area include:
<ul>
<li>Deans will review activities in schools and colleges</li>
<li>VPs and/or AVPs will review activities for administrative units (each VP will determine the appropriate starting point for his or her unit)</li>
<li>Athletic administrators will review activities in Athletics</li>
</ul>
<p>Decisions should be based on the relative risk of the travel or visitor(s), understanding that our top priority as an institution is the health and safety of our campus community. If the dean, AVP or athletic administrator is the event sponsor, the determination for that event should be made by his or her supervisor so the decision is not made by someone personally invested in the organization of the event.
</p><p>
Questions to ask when considering the necessity of the travel or visitor(s) include:
</p><ul>
<li>Can you explain why the travel/visitor(s) is essential?</li>
<li>Can the travel/visitor(s) be postponed?</li>
<li>Can the purpose of the travel/visitor(s) be accomplished in another way (e.g., virtually)?</li>
<li>Does the size of the event/number of attendees create too much risk?</li>
<li>Do the attendees/visitor(s) create too much risk (e.g., coming from a domestic or international location with significant COVID-19 spread)?</li>
</ul>
<p>UA System and UAB leaders will continue to monitor the situation closely and provide additional or revised guidance as the situation evolves. Thank you for your attention to this important matter.<br><br>

   The University of Alabama System continues to closely monitor the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak.  Today System officials issued <a href="http://uasystem.edu/update-to-ua-systems-covid-19-interim-emergency-policy-statement/">guidance advising against any non-essential domestic travel</a> at this time, particularly to large conferences with attendees from multiple states or locations that have <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/what-us-states-have-declared-state-emergency-amid-coronavirus-outbreak-1491299">declared a state of emergency</a> due to the virus.  
</p>
<p> 
Faculty, staff and students on UA System campuses are encouraged to use good judgment when making travel decisions and work with campus administration to evaluate alternative methods of remote participation such as live-streaming of conference sessions and meetings.
 </p>
<p>
The UA System advisory also states: “Students, faculty and staff who have concerns about being exposed to the virus while traveling should not be required to travel.  Likewise, any student, faculty or staff member who elects not to attend a previously scheduled event due to those concerns should not be disciplined.”  <a href="http://uasystem.edu/update-to-ua-systems-covid-19-interim-emergency-policy-statement/">Read the full advisory here.</a>

                <div class="uk-margin"><h3>Email from President Ray L. Watts and Health System CEO Will Ferniany: Coronavirus Preparedness Updates and Resources as of March 4, 2020</h3>
<p><em> *NOTE: The following email was sent March 4, 2020 at 3:30 p.m. as part of a collaborative communications effort led by the University of Alabama System in the interest of health and safety on the three System campuses. Last week Chancellor Finis St. John appointed a COVID-19 Communications and Policy Task Force to address the 2019 Corona virus. The task force, comprised of UA System medical researchers, faculty and staff, is continuously monitoring public health risks posed by the outbreak. Subsequently, a comprehensive <a href="https://www.uab.edu/news/images/2018/images/covid19/UA_System_COVID-19_Policy.pdf">University of Alabama System Interim Emergency Policy</a> was developed regarding the 2019 Coronavirus. The policy will be updated as circumstances warrant.</em></p>
<p>UAB Community,</p>
<p><strong>Today you received an email about <a href="http://uasystem.edu/news/2020/02/ua-system-covid-19-updates/">new travel restrictions</a>, including the CANCELATION of all university-sponsored international travel in March. Travel outside the United States after March is ON HOLD and will be addressed as soon as possible. Details can be found on the UAB Updates tab of<a href="http://www.uab.edu/coronavirus"> www.uab.edu/coronavirus</a>,</strong> an online resource that provides important information, tips and resources as we safeguard our community and prepare for the likely appearance of novel coronavirus (COVID-19) in Alabama. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">If you have not read that communication, please do so in the interest of your health and safety, and that of our community.</span></p>
<p>While there are no known cases of COVID-19 in Alabama at the time of this communication, there are confirmed cases in Florida and Georgia, and it could be seen in Alabama soon. COVID-19 appears to cause mild illness in the majority of those infected but can be fatal. <strong>Learn more at <a href="http://www.uab.edu/coronavirus">www.uab.edu/coronavirus</a>.</strong></p>
<p>The CDC predicts possible significant disruptions to daily life in the United States. While we cannot predict whether our community will be affected in a small or big way,<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> we want to be prepared for even extreme outcomes. </span></p>
<p><strong>UAB officials are and have been very active in monitoring the quickly evolving outbreak with infectious disease and public health experts and taking aggressive steps to prepare for possible scenarios. </strong>University and Health System emergency management professionals have convened broad and targeted groups to review the plans to address an infectious disease outbreak and apply it to the specific COVID-19 threat.</p>
<p>Units across campus have been taking steps to prepare for eventualities. For example:</p>
<ul>
	<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">First and foremost, medical providers at the University and Health System are trained to properly care for patients with infectious diseases and have plans in place to safely care for COVID-19 patients.</span></li>
	<li><strong>UAB launched <a href="http://www.uab.edu/coronavirus">www.uab.edu/coronavirus</a> as a resource to communicate news and updates, as well as tips to stay healthy and prepare. Information will be maintained there</strong>.</li>
	<li>UAB Facilities is increasing the frequency of cleaning and disinfecting areas like bathrooms, entryways, door handles, railings and elevator buttons.</li>
	<li>From Campus Housing and Dining to Environmental Health and Safety, to Hospital Supply Chain, procurement officials have assessed what supplies are needed now and what supplies would be needed if disruptions become extreme.</li>
	<li>Plans to manage and conserve supplies (e.g., plans to prioritize, limit and/or reuse certain supplies to avoid a shortage if the duration of disruptions become significant) are being reviewed and updated based on possible COVID-19 scenarios.</li>
	<li><strong>Offices that support international travel for students, faculty and staff are supporting unexpected changes in travel plans and programs to minimize disruptions as much as possible while maintaining health and safety.</strong></li>
	<li>Health care professionals in Student and Employee Health have enacted protocols to monitor, guide and report the status of those returning from international destinations in partnership with the Alabama Department of Public Health.</li>
	<li><strong>Information Technology, the Office of the Provost, and school and college deans are taking steps to protect our ability to maintain our academic mission while employing social distancing techniques or quarantine measures. This planning includes addressing the technical and logistical infrastructure that would allow for classes to continue if they eventually need to move online in Canvas.</strong></li>
	<li>Planning and preparations are also taking place to protect our vital research mission. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Research Administration leadership is updating business continuity plans based on COVID-19 and will continue to monitor and prepare to protect research activities as much as possible if disruptions occur</span>.</li>
	<li>Human Resources is consulting with leadership to provide guidance regarding the possible future need for work-from-home scenarios.</li>
	<li><strong>Areas have been identified where facilities can be repurposed to safely manage patient flow should an influx of COVID-19 patients take place.</strong></li>
	<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">We are encouraging patients with concerning symptoms to call their health care provider before going to the doctor,</span> and our Emergency Department is screening incoming patients just outside the entrance to the Emergency Department to decrease possible exposure to others.</li>
</ul>
<p>These are just a few examples of steps being taken. <strong>Units across campus will continue to update their specific plans to protect each other and our community and continue to deliver essential services. </strong>Disruptions — small or large — may be inevitable; but our goal is to minimize the effect on you — our students, faculty and staff — as well as the education, research, innovation and economic development, patient care, and community service pillars of our mission.</p>
<p><strong>Please continue to look to your emails and <a href="http://www.uab.edu/coronavirus">www.uab.edu/coronavirus</a> for important updates.</strong> At UAB, we are fortunate to have many experts in epidemiology and the prevention and treatment of infectious diseases to guide us. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Know that our top priority will remain the continued health and safety of our UAB community.</span></p>
<p><strong> Please continue to be vigilant,<a href="https://www.ready.gov/pandemic"> plan ahead </a>and protect against spreading viral illness:</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Wash hands frequently</strong> and avoid touching your face with unwashed hands.</li>
	<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Avoid sick people, avoid people if you are sick, and do not travel if you are sick</span>.</li>
	<li>Clean and disinfect surfaces and cover your cough or sneeze with a sleeve or tissue.</li>

	<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>If you have symptoms, call your health care provider BEFORE</strong></span> going to the doctor:
		<ul>
			<li>Students should call UAB Health Services at 205-934-3580.</li>
		</ul>
		<ul>
			<li>UAB employees should call UAB Employee Health at 205-934-3675 from 6:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. Monday through Friday. After hours and on weekends, call the UAB Call Center at 205-934-3411 and ask them to page the needlestick/exposure nurse on call.</li>

<p>While we cannot restrict individuals’ travel for personal business or affiliate programs (i.e., travel that is not university-sponsored but related to academic or business pursuits — e.g., travel through another institution or program), the UA System strongly encourages students, faculty and staff to follow <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/index.html">CDC travel watches, alerts and warnings</a>, and be aware of additional <strong><a href="http://click.reach.uab.edu/?qs=fb7dfac11ff413445174656257338052c2ca91648af327be03457332961fb95d8e4d10c8602cdd4f37f913fb08b3f8ef37c9e1a51fed1851">CDC</a></strong> and <strong><a href="http://click.reach.uab.edu/?qs=fb7dfac11ff41344c761a68118713fb2f16550540ea7ecc81ee16f7cc7ba0935a4fc82a2c3b56f18578c679ae10435a18bef7af8798feaee">State Department</a></strong> updates. <strong>The global situation is rapidly evolving, and risk of acquiring COVID-19 may change abruptly.

<p>Any and all travelers returning to the United States or coming to the United States to participate in university-sponsored business or programs must comply with all U.S. re-entry, quarantine, self-isolation or self-monitoring requirements in place before returning to or engaging with the university community. Travelers must provide verification from the <a href="http://alabamapublichealth.gov/infectiousdiseases/2019-coronavirus.html?utm_source=MC_100006781&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=200228+-+Coronavirus&amp;utm_content=ADPH+website#resources">Alabama Department of Public Health</a> or their health provider confirming they have completed the appropriate monitoring process.

<p>We understand that many members of our community may have upcoming spring break travel, conferences or summer study abroad plans that this policy may affect. We further understand that the longer the travel restrictions remain in place, more questions will arise related to future plans for international travel. To assess the impact of the virus on faculty, staff and students, a dedicated team composed of members from throughout the UA System, including our clinical and infection prevention experts, is monitoring the outbreak and utilizing guidance from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the World Health Organization, and international governments and health agencies. <strong>Administrators at each campus are continuously evaluating and receiving advice on potential impacts and will provide future information and guidance.</strong></p>
<p>While there are no known cases of COVID-19 in Alabama at the time of this communication, there are confirmed cases in Florida and Georgia, and it could be seen in Alabama soon.</p>
<p><strong>Please continue to be vigilant, <a href="https://www.ready.gov/pandemic">plan ahead</a> and protect against spreading viral illness:</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cViNneQbPyA&amp;feature=emb_title">Wash hands frequently</a>, and avoid touching your face with unwashed hands.</li>
	<li>Avoid sick people, avoid people if you are sick, and do not travel if you are sick.</li>
	<li>Clean and disinfect surfaces, and cover your cough or sneeze with a sleeve or tissue.</li>
	<li>Protect against the flu by getting the flu vaccine. The flu vaccine does not protect against COVID-19, but the flu poses an active health threat in Alabama at this time.</li>
	<li><strong>If you have <a href="https://www.uab.edu/news/images/2018/images/covid19/Coronavirus-Symptoms-graphic.jpg">symptoms</a>, call your health care provider BEFORE going to the doctor:</strong>
		<ul>
			<li>Students should call UAB Student Health Services at 205-934-3580.</li>
			<li>UAB employees should call UAB Employee Health at 205-934-3675 from 6:30 a.m.-5 p.m. Monday-Friday. After hours and on weekends, call the UAB Call Center at 205-934-3411 and ask them to page the needlestick/exposure nurse on-call.</li>
