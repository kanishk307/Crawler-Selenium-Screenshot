    UAB students, faculty and staff,</p>
 
<p>Our <a href="http://www.uab.edu/reentry">gradual re-entry to campus</a> continues and is going well, as is our planning with the University of Alabama System for a safe return this fall with a hybrid model – a course delivery system which, because of social distancing precautions, requires a combination of both in-person instruction and remote instruction. To promote the health and safety of the campus community, adjustments have been made to the fall semester schedule:</p>
 
<ul>
<li>Fall semester hybrid classes will start Monday, Aug. 24, 2020.</li>
<li>Fall semester hybrid classes will end Friday, Nov. 20, for the Thanksgiving break.</li>
<li>Students will not return to campus after Thanksgiving break. </li>
<li>Exceptions can be granted for students based on work, research or clinical responsibilities, and accommodations can be requested for international students or others who do not have alternate living arrangements.  </li>
<li>Classes during the week of Nov. 30-Dec. 4, as well as final exams during the week of Dec. 7-11, will be conducted remotely.<br>
<em>Coursework engagement during these weeks is necessary to accommodate <a href="https://sacscoc.org/accrediting-standards/">SACSCOC accrediting standard</a> requirements for credit granted for coursework. </em></li>
</ul>

<p>Additional information for our phased re-entry to campus (including details about on-campus housing, classroom protocols, personal protective equipment, and COVID-19 training and testing) continue to be worked out and will be communicated in the coming days and weeks. UAB’s e-newsletters are your source of official information. To stay informed of the latest news and updates, students are encouraged read Greenmail each Wednesday, and faculty and staff are encouraged to read eReporter each Tuesday and Friday. We will also continue to update <a href="https://www.uab.edu/coronavirus/">uab.edu/coronavirus</a> and <a href="http://www.uab.edu/reentry">uab.edu/reentry</a>. </p>
 
<p>In the meantime, please continue to be an example in our community by following important <a href="https://www.uab.edu/coronavirus/social-distancing?utm_source=MC_100006781&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=200506+-+Coronavirus+-+Student+Update&utm_content=important+guidelines">COVID-19 safety guidelines</a>.

                <div class="uk-margin"><h3>
    A Message from Provost Pam Benoit to the UAB Faculty About “Re-Entry to Campus” Planning
</h3>

<p>I know all of you are anxious about what it will be like to come back to campus in the fall. A great deal of planning has been underway for that re-entry to campus, almost since the day that we suddenly had to leave campus in March. As is the case at all large, complex universities, there are at least as many unknowns as there are knowns for us here at UAB. Let me share a few of the knowns, subject, of course, to the important caveat that external events could upend even the most extensive advance planning:</p>

<p><strong>Known #1:</strong><br>
Your safety, and that of your students, is extremely important to us.</p>

<p><strong>Known #2:</strong><br>
We are planning to commence instruction for the Fall 2020 semester on August 24, 2020, the first day of the Fall semester. As you can understand, the exact start and end dates are, however, among the most fluid issues facing us right now, so please stay tuned.</p>

<p><strong>Known #3:</strong><br>
We are planning on delivering the normal amount of content to students during the Fall semester, regardless of start and end dates and mode of delivery.</p>

<p><strong>Known #4:</strong><br>
We will be practicing significant social distancing in all teaching locations. This will mean that on any given day there will be some students physically present in the classroom, appropriately distanced, and there will also be students who are learning remotely (synchronously or otherwise). As you develop your materials for Canvas, it would be useful to think about how you can enrich your Canvas site in order to facilitate maximum amount of flexibility.</p>

<p><strong>Known #5:</strong><br>
Because of the social distancing in classrooms, we are asking faculty to design their courses in such a way that allows all students, whether physically present or not, to receive the same quality of learning activities. Resources are available at the websites of eLearning and Professional Studies and the Center for Teaching and Learning. Additional resources will continue to be added to these sites.</p>

<p><strong>Known #6:</strong><br>
We will use our best efforts to provide the necessary classroom technology to accomplish effective instruction.</p>

<p><strong>Known #7:</strong><br>
We will be taking other precautions both with facilities (e.g., signage and cleaning) and with personal protective equipment (e.g., masks) designed to protect your health, that of your students, and staff that make up our UAB community.</p>

<p>The UAB leadership has been seeking input from the Faculty Senate throughout this pandemic crisis, so your voice has been well-represented in all of our decision-making. I promise to communicate with you periodically between now and the start of the Fall 2020 semester as we get more and more “knowns,” so that you can be ready.

The Health System is on a separate plan to transition from the Limited Business Model and began resuming clinical operations in early May. </p></strong>
 
<p>UAB faculty and staff,
    
</p>
 <p>
    Earlier this week, the university announced a gradual, phased approach to campus re-entry detailed at <a href="http://www.uab.edu/reentry">www.uab.edu/reentry</a>. 
</p>

 <p>
   Phase I, which is set for May 26 through June 15, includes the gradual re-entry of some individuals with clinical or research responsibilities. This time period is a window in which individuals approved to return in this phase will begin campus re-entry; not everyone in Phase I will return May 26.  
</p>

<p>
   Before individuals in Phase I (or any future phase) re-enter campus, several steps must be completed: 
</p> 

<ol>
<li>Supervisors will draft a unit-specific operational re-entry plan and submit it for approval.</li>
<li>Subsequently, you will receive an email from Campus Learning (<span id="cloak0e35a34742057d9a871e8b42e3274db2">This email address is being protected from spambots. You need JavaScript enabled to view it.</span><script type='text/javascript'>

<li>When you receive the email from the learning management system, follow the prompts and complete required training.</li>

<li>After you complete the required training and health check, your supervisor will be notified that you are approved to return to campus.</li>
</ol>
 
<p>No one is permitted to return to campus until they have completed these steps and have clearance for re-entry from their supervisor. When you return, you must follow all safety guidelines. You should not initiate training modules until you receive prompts from Campus Learning by email. This is to verify that UAB personnel have completed their training.</p>
 

<p><a href="https://www.uab.edu/coronavirus/reentry/reentry-to-campus-checklist">Re-entry checklists are available</a> to guide students, faculty and staff as they prepare for their return to campus and when they are on campus. </p>

<p>At this time, not everyone will know into which re-entry phase they fit and when they will be approved to return. Contact your supervisor with questions about your phase. We will continue to support units in the development of their required operational plans so updates can be provided.</p>

    <h3 class="uk-accordion-title"><span>UAB to provide masks for onsite employees</span> Thursday, April 30 at 9 a.m.</h3>

    <div class="uk-accordion-content">

        
        
        
                <div class="uk-margin"><p>
    This week the City of Birmingham passed an <a href="https://www.birminghamal.gov/2020/04/28/city-of-birmingham-to-require-face-coverings-effective-may-1/?utm_source=MC_100006781&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=200430+-+Mandatory+Masks&utm_content=https%3a%2f%2fwww.birminghamal.gov%2f2020%2f04%2f28%2fcity-of-birmingham-to-require-face-coverings-effective-may-1%2f">ordinance to require face coverings be worn by people in public places</a> within the city limits, effective Friday, May 1, and employers such as UAB are obligated to ensure its employees observe this decree. The order has been implemented to protect Birmingham citizens — and workers in the city — as the effects of COVID-19 pandemic continue to unfold.</p>

<p>
Although the city ordinance does not require employers to provide facial coverings for employees, UAB is providing this resource to the limited number of employees on campus during limited business so workers can comply with the mandate without personal expense.</p>

<p>
 
Fiscal officers in the schools and business units have been contacted and arrangements are underway for the masks to be picked up or delivered to them before the May 1 deadline. Each employee will receive one mask made of black fabric that loops behind the ear. You may wear the mask provided or one of your own, as long as your face is covered.
 </p>

<p>
Please note, for the mask to protect you, it must be worn properly, covering both the nose and mouth. In this video, Rachael Lee, M.D., with UAB’s Division of Infectious Diseases, demonstrates <a href="http://click.reach.uab.edu/?qs=09281b81a9b9040c9c5c93486c718657df5bf1b8a3df0114efd7e030cc92b669894ac315fba30c86590298e1bad55dca5d3b3a11281cf198">how to wear a face mask safely</a>. A written explanation also is provided on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website in addition to <a href="http://click.reach.uab.edu/?qs=09281b81a9b9040ce7375762aeea38c6e4540a728e578554429d71fb9c19db96bce381178a1413a09f6a3b88e265d288832dd355fafa9cda">instructions for making and cleaning cloth masks</a>.
 </p>

<p>
People who cannot medically tolerate or safely wear a mask can be exempted from this ordinance. If you believe you qualify for an exemption, please discuss this with your supervisor immediately. Supervisors with questions should contact HR. Otherwise, the City of Birmingham can impose a fine of up to $500 and/or up to 30 days in the municipal jail for those who violate the ordinance.
 </p>

<p>
It is important that, even with the masks, we continue to <a href="http://click.reach.uab.edu/?qs=09281b81a9b9040cd5a6e3a11d4ffbc6895553517ae5696e4a97262c2f905eec9e4f1575b675c74d7223e64db79742a63158c235f2fa987c">follow our guidelines for social distancing</a> to ensure the safest possible environment.

    <h3 class="uk-accordion-title"><span>Notice regarding emergency leave of absence provisions</span> Wednesday, April 1 at 5:30 p.m.</h3>

    <div class="uk-accordion-content">

        
        
        
                <div class="uk-margin"><p>
    UAB faculty and staff,</p><p>
 
Today, April 1, 2020, the Emergency Family and Medical Leave Expansion Act (EFMLEA) and the Emergency Paid Sick Leave Act (EPSLA) go into effect. These laws provide paid leave to eligible employees of a covered employer under certain defined circumstances associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. 
 </p><p>
Please note these new laws contain a broad exemption for employees working as “health care providers,” which includes anyone employed at a hospital, health care center, doctor’s office, health clinic, postsecondary educational institution offering health care instruction, medical school, and similar health care entities. This exemption is intended to ensure health care-related entities are positioned to continue to provide their services during this unprecedented time.</p><p>
 
After reviewing the new laws, the following employees are designated as “health care providers” and are therefore exempt from receiving benefits under the new laws:</p>
 
<ul>
<li>All employees in <a href="https://www.uab.edu/humanresources/home/wfgroups">Workgroup C</a> of the School of Medicine</li>
<li>All Faculty of the School of Medicine</li>
<li>All UAB Hospital employees</li>
<li>All UAB Hospital Management, LLC, employees</li>
<li>All UAB Callahan Eye Hospital Authority employees</li>
<li>All UAB Health System employees</li>
<li>All University of Alabama Health Services Foundation employees</li>
</ul>
 <p>
If you do not fall into one of the categories of employees listed above, you may be eligible for benefits under these new laws. This law was announced at the end of March, and UAB Human Resources has been working to update the existing <a href="https://www.uab.edu/humanresources/home/records-administration/leave-of-absence">UAB HR Leave website</a> to accommodate necessary changes to help faculty and staff understand and navigate the law and process. You can review information about the specific nature of the leave benefits potentially available and the eligibility requirements on <a href="https://www.uab.edu/humanresources/home/records-administration/leave-of-absence">Human Resources’ FMLA website</a>.

    <h3 class="uk-accordion-title"><span>Important Parking Information from UAB Health System</span> Saturday, March 28 at 2 p.m.</h3>

    <div class="uk-accordion-content">

        
        
        
                <div class="uk-margin"><p>
    UAB Medicine Employees,</p><p>
 
The City of Birmingham has received criticism from hospital employees for ticketing cars parked illegally outside of UAB Hospital in recent days. Even during this unusual time, I believe it remains important – for many reasons – for the city to continue to enforce parking laws on the Southside.  
 </p><p>
Working with UAB Transportation we have made special arrangements to make convenient parking more accessible to you. Effective since March 19, employees who normally park in the Express lot have been given access to closer locations, all within three blocks of the hospital. We ask parkers who have been reassigned to continue to park in those lots/decks to which they are assigned.
 </p><p>
In addition, several lots and decks all over campus that are typically gated have been opened and are available to employees. Employees who do not already have another parking reassignment, can now access these options, including the 5th Ave. Deck (entrance at on 5th Ave. S. between 19th and 20th Streets).
 </p><p>
These options have been made available for your convenience and to discourage our employees from on-street parking. Mayor Randall Woodfin’s team has been a good partner to the healthcare community and UAB during the pandemic. We could not ask for a more supportive and cooperative relationship.  
 </p><p>
Just as the city supports us, I support and encourage the city’s position to enforce parking around UAB Hospital. We simply need them to do so. Please use the many options UAB Transportation has made available to you.
 </p><p>
If you have questions or concerns about parking, or need an accommodation, please contact UAB Transportation at 205-934-3513 Monday thru Friday between 7:30 a.m.-4:30 p.m.

    We continue to address as expeditiously as possible the unprecedented challenges created by the novel coronavirus COVID-19 on our students, faculty and staff. On March 13, 2020, we distributed the <a href="http://click.reach.uab.edu/?qs=4c80daff37a76c29da5bfab11f77628dc0c210b7c7b2fdd63e23b6c55a6107f1644996bb82ef5376a1c65917ae741620a4b498d682c9d34c">Academic Continuity Plan</a> for disruptions caused by an infectious disease outbreak. We continue to operate within that plan and now have a <a href="http://click.reach.uab.edu/?qs=4c80daff37a76c29528855e5093613e87cdf69294443e89a36fd5cd108dbb921b4f39a548358b6c976ff4d5b9104c3d83026bb32bba9f76c">Supplement No. 1</a> to add to that Plan. This supplemental piece describes several announcements that have already been made since that date, and also provides several additional changes in academic operations in the following areas:
</p><ul>
<li>Allowing all students to elect a Pass/Fail grading system for Spring semester courses (with the possibility that with dean approval such a system might not be available, most likely to occur in graduate courses)</li>
<li>A default one-year extension of the promotion and tenure “clock”</li>
<li>A default directive not to use student course evaluations during spring semester</li>
</ul>
    <p>
        We believe that the above changes will help ease the widespread anxiety, uncertainty, and social and geographic disruption you are facing. As you can see, there are more details to follow; but we wanted to get these announcements to you as quickly as possible. The changes have been reviewed and approved by the Faculty Senate leadership as well as by leadership of the Undergraduate Student Government Association. This new reality is still fluid and uncertain, but we remain confident in our UAB community’s resolve to adapt and work together.

<p>
  UAB Medicine faculty and staff (including student employees/workers), 
</p><p>
The following information from UAB Health System and School of Medicine provides updates on UAB Medicine’s limited business model for <a href="https://www.uab.edu/humanresources/home/wfgroups/">Workgroup C</a> (including Callahan Eye Hospital). 
</p><p>

With guidance from Human Resources, leaders across the university and Health System have been working to assess resources and staffing needs, and will be moving to a limited business model. <strong>Based on the latest COVID-19 developments and the need to minimize in-person contact, UAB Medicine will begin transitioning to a limited business model for employees in <a href="https://www.uab.edu/humanresources/home/wfgroups">Workgroup C</a> starting Tuesday, March 17, to be fully implemented by 5 p.m. The limited business model will be reevaluated on or before April 1. </strong>
</p><p>

<strong>Again, the following information about a limited business model applies to <a href="https://www.uab.edu/humanresources/home/wfgroups">Workgroup C</a>. Faculty (<a href="https://www.uab.edu/humanresources/home/wfgroups">Workgroup F</a>) involved in activities that require a presence at their work location (e.g., patient care or essential research) should continue to report to their place of work. Faculty who can work remotely (e.g., if you have only instructing responsibilities that can be done online), please do so from your home if possible. If you have questions, consult your supervisor.</strong>
</p><p>

At this time, a limited business model is in the best interests of the health and safety of UAB Medicine patients, faculty and staff, and is an important community service to minimize COVID-19 spread. <strong>During this time, it is vital that everyone in every group practices aggressive and meaningful <a href="/coronavirus/social-distancing">social distancing</a>, as well as proper hygiene to avoid contracting or spreading COVID-19.</strong> If you <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/symptoms-testing/symptoms.html">experience COVID-19 symptoms</a>, call before you go to the doctor. Please call <a href="https://www.uab.edu/humanresources/home/employeehealth">Employee Health</a> or call <a href="https://www.uabmedicine.org/4you">UAB Medicine 4YOU</a> at 205-934-9999. 
</p><p>


Based on these changes to operations, this limited business model identifies employees in <a href="https://www.uab.edu/humanresources/home/wfgroups">Workgroup C</a> who are:
</p><ul>
<li>needed to continue work in-person (Limited Business Model <a href="https://www.uab.edu/humanresources/home/wfgroups">Workgroup C</a>, Group 1)</li>
<li>needed to continue work but can do so from home (Limited Business Model <a href="https://www.uab.edu/humanresources/home/wfgroups">Workgroup C</a>, Group 2)</li>
<li>not needed to work during a time of limited business (Limited Business Model Workgroup C, Group 3)</li>
</ul>
<p>

<strong><em>NOTE: Unit leaders/supervisors will assign and communicate group assignments within <a href="https://www.uab.edu/humanresources/home/wfgroups">Workgroup C</a>.</em></strong>
</p><h4>
How will limited business operations work?
</h4>

<p>

Employees are assigned to the appropriate group by their unit leadership/supervisor and should follow supervisor instructions.  
</p><p>

<strong><a href="https://www.uab.edu/humanresources/home/wfgroups">Workgroup C</a>, Group 1 will report to work as normal; <a href="https://www.uab.edu/humanresources/home/wfgroups">Workgroup C</a> Group 2 will stay home and continue to work; and <a href="https://www.uab.edu/humanresources/home/wfgroups">Workgroup C</a>, Group 3 will not work. Supervisors determine which positions and employees are suitable for telecommuting, not the individual employees themselves.
</strong></p><p>

</p><ul>
    <li><strong><a href="https://www.uab.edu/humanresources/home/wfgroups">Workgroup C</a>, Group 1</strong> will report to work as normal (unless you are sick or have been in immediate contact with a person known to have COVID-19 — see <a href="/coronavirus/info-for-you/faculty/#employee-health-faqs">employee coronavirus health resources</a>).</li><ul>
   
<li>Maintain <a href="/coronavirus/social-distancing">social distance and good hygiene</a>. Utilize phone calls and virtual meetings as much as possible (even for small groups). Any gatherings of more than 25 people in-person should take place only if deemed essential and will require approval from AVP or above. </li>
    <li>Supervisors should make every effort to <strong>not include student-employees (other than Residents or Fellows) in <a href="https://www.uab.edu/humanresources/home/wfgroups">Workgroup C</a>, Group 1</strong>. If a supervisor thinks a student’s role is essential, approval must be granted by HR before a student is assigned to <a href="https://www.uab.edu/humanresources/home/wfgroups">Workgroup C</a>, Group 1. For guidance on research activities, please see <a href="/coronavirus/info-for-you/researchers">Resources for Researchers</a> on uab.edu/coronavirus. </li></ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://www.uab.edu/humanresources/home/wfgroups">Workgroup C</a>, Group 2</strong> will stay home and continue to work (as soon as possible but in effect no later than 5 p.m. Tuesday, March 17). If you do not need to return to your work location, don’t. Also, <strong>do not return to your work location if you are sick. See <a href="/coronavirus/info-for-you/faculty/#employee-health-faqs">employee coronavirus health resources</a> for guidance if you think you may have symptoms.</strong> </li>
<ul>
<li>If needed, Tuesday, March 17, can be used to prepare to effectively work from home. If you need to go to your work location to get essential items (e.g., laptop, supplies) to make working from home possible, coordinate with your supervisor to stagger timing with others in order to minimize personal contact. </li>
<li>Carefully read the <a href="https://powerforms.docusign.net/58ce1541-732a-4a7e-90a2-fe19420c3a6e?env=na3-eu1&amp;acct=097de7a9-05d2-49f4-9572-521df6d32f4a">UAB Medicine Temporary Telecommuting Guidance</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Rather than forwarding your work phone to your cellphone, please change your outgoing voicemail message on your work phone to instruct callers to call your cellphone directly. This will alleviate capacity constraints we would face if too many work phones are forwarded. </strong></li> 
<li>Utilize available resources on the One website to set up remote working capabilities.
Consult oneuabmedicine.org/coronavirus under HSIS Resources or call the Help Desk at 205-934-8888.</li>
    <li>Your group assignment is subject to change if business needs arise. </li><ul>
    
    </ul>
<em></em><p><em>Working from home can be challenging. For the short- and long-term health of our institution and our vital mission, managing those challenges to remain productive is imperative. Communicate with your supervisor and/or speak with your Human Resources representative for guidance. 
</em></p></ul><p>


</p><li><strong><a href="https://www.uab.edu/humanresources/home/wfgroups">Workgroup C</a>, Group 3</strong> will not work (after being notified of your group assignment by your supervisor). </li>
<ul><li>Unfortunately, the COVID-19 pandemic makes it necessary to limit on-site personnel to only those whose functions are imperative during limited business operations — and not all functions can be done remotely or are required under extreme circumstances.  </li>   
<li><a href="https://www.uab.edu/humanresources/home/wfgroups">Workgroup C</a>, Group 3 employees will be paid administrative time using “Away with Pay” code during the initial 14-day limited business period. In the event of a prolonged disruption, leadership will work with all sources (federal, state, etc.) in an effort to continue financial support of our employees. Further, UAB Medicine Leadership is exploring opportunities — including possible use of the Benevolent Fund — to financially help employees who encounter hardships due to the suspension of work IF limited business lasts longer than two weeks.
</li>   
<li>If you need to go to your work location to get critical personal belongings you must have during the next two weeks, coordinate with your supervisor for approval and to stagger timing with others to minimize personal contact.   
</li>   
    <li>Your group assignment is subject to change if business needs arise. </li>

<p>Re:  Suspension of non-emergency clinical operations and student clinical activities in the Schools of Dentistry, Optometry, Nursing, Health Professions, Education 
</p>
<p>As of <strong>Monday, March 16, 2020</strong>, the Schools of Dentistry, Optometry, Nursing, Health Professions, and Education will postpone or cancel clinical non-emergency or elective procedures and appointments. The School of Medicine and the UAB Health System are continuing to address this policy and will be issuing further guidance for their operations this week.</p>
<p>The number of individuals impacted by the novel coronavirus COVID-19 is increasing in the United States and more cases are being reported in Alabama and our immediate area as more testing is being completed. <a href="http://click.reach.uab.edu/?qs=eb5ccb5c5e2e68defebe0b07436a235ae90633a13219627369967ea4c1183e91628902eee3ee20b18b4d90ffbc1be4cc1451bfec44b9a33e">Reports</a> indicate that Alabama is particularly at risk because of the prevalence of the number of individuals in the higher risk category in our state.</p>
<p>You will have received a message this afternoon from the university about moving to a limited business model to contain the spread of COVID-19. What does this mean for the <strong>clinical</strong> operations in your School?</p>
<p>As of <strong>Monday, March 16, 2020</strong>, the Schools of Dentistry, Optometry, Nursing, Health Professions, and Education will postpone or cancel clinical non-emergency or elective procedures and appointments. The School of Medicine and the UAB Health System are continuing to address this policy and will be issuing further guidance for their operations this week.</p>
<p>If urgent or vital treatment is necessary in Dentistry, Optometry, Nursing, Health Professions, and Education, providers will determine the appropriate precautions to be taken and the setting where this treatment will occur.  This may include referrals to a more appropriate treatment center during this time. Schools will implement their communication plans to inform patients about this policy.</p>
<p>Urgent or vital treatment will be provided by essential faculty/staff. Faculty/staff who have questions about whether they are expected to be at work, consult with your supervisor or HR liaison. </p>
<p>Students in these schools will not participate in clinical activities until further notice. Students should not report to clinical rotations or externships. We will continually monitor to determine when these activities can resume, and we will attempt to minimize this disruption. Each school will explore alternative activities and/or reordering of their curriculum by prioritizing patient care, learner safety, and education in these extraordinary times. Schools are increasingly experiencing difficulties with placing and maintaining clinical rotations due to increasing challenges in the health care system as a result of COVID-19. We will work closely with the relevant accrediting agencies to minimize the impact on students’ academic progress.</p>
<p>We recognize that this directive will be inconvenient and challenging for providers, patients, and students. Careful thought and consultation were involved in making this difficult decision. This directive is being given because:</p>
<ul>
<li>Many of our patients fall into high risk categories</li>
<li>Minimizing social gatherings is critical (e.g., waiting rooms)</li>
<li>Our facilities are not designed for infectious diseases with the infectivity of Covid-19</li>
<li>We need to conserve personal protective equipment (PPE) during a nationwide shortage </li>
</ul>
<p>The situation is changing daily and policies may need to be adjusted as we continually respond to emerging needs. Thank you for your flexibility and patience in a very challenging environment.

<p>
 
 
UAB faculty and staff (including student employees/workers),</p><p>
 
Late Friday, a state of emergency was declared for Alabama and the nation to address the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. This announcement — which includes the closing of K-12 schools statewide starting Wednesday at 5 p.m. and relaxing absentee policies in some schools for the beginning of the week — has prompted concerns and questions about UAB policies that address remote work, essential staffing and child care issues.</p><p>
 
With guidance from Human Resources, leaders across the university have been working to assess resources and staffing needs, and will be moving to a limited business model. <strong>Based on the latest COVID-19 developments and the need to minimize in-person contact, UAB (university) will begin transitioning to a limited business model for employees in <a href="https://www.uab.edu/humanresources/home/wfgroups">Workgroup A</a> starting Monday, March 16, to be fully implemented by 5 p.m. The limited business model will be in place for at least 14 days starting March 17.</strong></p><p>
 
<strong>Again, the following information about a limited business model applies ONLY to <a href="https://www.uab.edu/humanresources/home/wfgroups">Workgroup A</a>. Faculty (<a href="https://www.uab.edu/humanresources/home/wfgroups">Workgroup F</a>) are asked to work remotely IF POSSIBLE (e.g., if you are instructing online, do so from your home, not campus), and come to campus only if required (e.g., direct patient care or research responsibilities that require a physical presence on campus). If you have questions, consult with your supervisor. Instructions and updates for employees in <a href="https://www.uab.edu/humanresources/home/wfgroups">Workgroup C</a> and those at Children’s of Alabama will be forthcoming from the UAB Health System and School of Medicine.</strong></p><p>
 
This limited business model identifies employees in <a href="https://www.uab.edu/humanresources/home/wfgroups">Workgroup A</a> who are:
</p><ul>
<li>needed to continue work in-person (Limited Business Model Workgroup A, Group 1)</li>
<li>needed to continue work but can do so from home (Limited Business Model Workgroup A, Group 2)</li>
<li>not needed to work during a time of limited business (Limited Business Model Workgroup A, Group 3)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong><em>NOTE: Unit leaders/supervisors will assign and communicate group assignments within Workgroup A.</em></strong></p><p>
Early data suggests a limited business model may reduce the presence of on-site university employees by as much as 75 percent while maintaining functions critical to the UAB mission. It is important to remember that UAB Hospital never closes and continues to prepare to safely isolate and care for COVID-19 patients.</p><p>

At this time, a limited business model is in the best interests of the health and safety of our students, faculty and staff, and is an important community service to minimize COVID-19 spread. <strong>During this time, it is vital that everyone in every group practices aggressive and meaningful <a href="/coronavirus/social-distancing">social distancing, as well as proper hygiene</a> to avoid contracting or spreading COVID-19.</strong> If you experience symptoms, call before you go to the doctor.

<h4>
 How will limited business operations work?   
</h4><p>
Employees are assigned to the appropriate group by their unit leadership/supervisor and should follow supervisor instructions. </p><p>
<strong>Workgroup A, Group 1 will report to work as normal; Workgroup A, Group 2 will stay home and continue to work; and Workgroup A, Group 3 will not work. Supervisors determine which positions and employees are suitable for telecommuting, not the individual employees themselves.</strong>
 
</p><ul>
<li><strong>Workgroup A, Group 1</strong> will report to work as normal <strong>(unless you are sick or have been in immediate contact with a person known to have COVID-19 — see <a href="/coronavirus/info-for-you/faculty/#employee-health-faqs">employee coronavirus health resources</a>).</strong></li><ul>
<li>Maintain <a href="/coronavirus/social-distancing">social distance and good hygiene</a>. Utilize phone calls and virtual meetings as much as possible (even for small groups). Any gatherings of more than 25 people will require approval from a dean, vice president or AVP.</li>
<li>Supervisors should make every effort to <strong>not include student-employees in Workgroup A, Group 1 for on-campus work</strong>. If a supervisor thinks a student’s role is essential, approval must be granted by HR before a student is assigned to Workgroup A, Group 1.</li></ul>
<li><strong>Workgroup A, Group 2</strong> will stay home and continue to work (as soon as possible but in effect no later than 5 p.m. Monday, March 16). If you do not need to return to campus, don’t. Also, <strong>do not return to campus if you are sick. See <a href="/coronavirus/info-for-you/faculty/#employee-health-faqs">employee coronavirus health resources</a> for guidance if you think you may have symptoms.</strong></li><ul>
<li>If needed, Monday, March 16, can be used to prepare to effectively work from home. If you need to go to campus to get essential items (e.g., laptop or desktop computer, supplies) to make working from home possible, coordinate with your supervisor to stagger coming to campus with others to limit contact with others.</li>
<li>Carefully read the <a href="https://www.uab.edu/news/images/2018/images/covid19/GUIDELINES_FOR_TEMPORARY_TELECOMMUTING.pdf">UAB Temporary Telecommuting Guidance</a>, sign the <a href="https://powerforms.docusign.net/58ce1541-732a-4a7e-90a2-fe19420c3a6e?env=na3-eu1&amp;acct=097de7a9-05d2-49f4-9572-521df6d32f4a">Temporary Telecommuting Agreement</a> and send to your supervisor (scan or digital photo is OK), then forward to your HR representative.</li><br>
</ul><ul>
    
    
<strong>The temporary telecommuting agreement and guidelines</strong> were established as part of UAB’s efforts to support business continuity across campus. They are temporary and should not be confused with UAB’s standard telecommuting agreement and guidelines. Highlights of the agreement include:
<ul>
<li>Supervisors determine which positions and employees are suitable for telecommuting, not the individual employees themselves.</li>
<li>The temporary telecommuting agreement can be modified or terminated at any time, especially if operational needs warrant the change. </li>
<li>Employees should understand obligations regarding securing UAB records and transmitting information (e.g., sensitive information related to student records, patient privacy, intellectual property, etc.).</li>
<li>Employees are responsible for establishing an appropriate work environment, meeting productivity and service goals required by management, keeping and reporting time worked, and communicating in the appropriate manner and frequency.</li><br>
</ul></ul>
    <ul>
        
<li><strong>Rather than forwarding your work phone to your cellphone, please change your outgoing voicemail message on your work phone to instruct callers to call your cellphone directly. This will alleviate capacity constraints we would face if too many work phones are forwarded.</strong> </li>
<li>Utilize available resources to set up remote working capabilities.</li><ul>

 The fast-moving and dynamic nature of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak has led to many uncertainties and questions. This is not unique to UAB, universities or health systems. We are glad the <a href="http://uasystem.edu/updated-interim-emergency-policy-for-ua-uab-and-uah/">University of Alabama System took decisive action as part of a proactive planning process</a> to promote health and safety on our campus.
</p><p>


As we work to operationalize the change, we may not have all the answers immediately. But a very dedicated team is committed to reducing uncertainties as much and as quickly as possible. <strong>Ultimately, we want to minimize disruption to the lives of our campus community while keeping health and safety our top priority.</strong></p><p>

 
A great deal of planning has taken place, and many questions have been answered. Please take the time to review the information that is available – including resources, communications and frequently asked questions – at <a href="https://dev.uab.edu/coronavirus/">www.uab.edu/coronavirus</a>.

<p>
As you know, we are shifting to online and alternative learning after spring break. Additional preparations are underway as we monitor the outbreak. <strong>Business operations are being maintained at this time (i.e., faculty and staff are asked to report to work), but we may need to make additional adjustments in the interest of health and safety.</strong> At this time, student workers/employees/interns who remain on campus and want to continue working may be able to maintain their normal work schedule. Managers are asked to be understanding of student-employees’ circumstances. Ultimately, circumstances will vary, and student-employees should speak with their supervisor/coordinating instructor who can consult leadership on a case-by-case basis as necessary.
</p><p>
In the event normal business operations are altered, Human Resources is working with leaders across campus to explore – for example – job functions that can take place in a remote setting off campus to promote social distancing.
 </p><p>

In the meantime, units on campus are encouraged to test remote working capabilities on a limited basis with some faculty and staff working from home to help identify challenges and opportunities, should a more comprehensive limited business plan be implemented. <a href="https://www.uab.edu/humanresources/home/images/Forms/Telecommuting-Agreement_5-27-16.pdf">UAB Telecommuting Agreement</a>
 </p><p>

Logistical changes – including limiting access to some facilities and closing some university functions – are being considered and will be communicated as soon as details are clear. While student access will be limited, all academic buildings will remain open to faculty and staff.

This policy will be re-evaluated on or before <strong>Monday, April 6, 2020.</strong></p>
<p>Each campus will keep faculty, staff and students updated electronically on individualized plans, timelines and specific changes as soon as possible. </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>UAB is scheduled for Spring Break the week of March 16-20.</strong><strong></strong> <strong>UAB’s Spring Break will be extended through at least March 24.</strong> Each campus will notify students, faculty and staff when the semester will resume. </li>

<li>Following Spring Break, UAB students should <strong>not</strong> return to campus and will continue their course work via distance learning subject to the following limited exceptions: </li><ul>
    <li>international or other students who do not have alternative accommodations; </li>
<li>students from areas without high-speed internet or other means of receiving remote instruction; </li>
<li>students with exceptional hardships, or academic, employment, clinical or research requirements that should be reviewed by the respective campuses on a case-by-case basis.  </li></ul>
    <li><strong>Arrangements will be made by the campuses to ensure any students remaining on campus have access to essential services (including Student Health Services/Counseling Services). Residence Hall and dining facilities will be open for students who remain on campus.</strong></li>
    
    <li>
    The UA System’s restriction on ALL non-essential international and domestic travel remains in place.  All non-essential University meetings, gatherings and events are cancelled.

    <div class="uk-accordion-content">

        
        
        
                <div class="uk-margin"><p>
    The University of Alabama System has created a task force led by UAB Health System experts to develop plans for its three campuses — University of Alabama, University of Alabama at Birmingham and University of Alabama in Huntsville — to be the safest universities in America when on-campus instruction resumes.
</p>
<p>
    Chancellor Fess St. John appointed Selwyn Vickers, M.D., dean of the UAB School of Medicine, and Katie Osburne, director of Risk & Compliance/System Counsel, to lead this effort. The task force will consider testing measures, enhanced cleaning, classroom procedures, housing policies, security and wellness programs and the provision of personal protective equipment in developing a comprehensive plan to protect students, faculty and staff. Other task force members include Jeanne Marrazzo, M.D., director, Division of Infectious Diseases, UAB Medicine; Craig J. Hoesley, M.D., senior associate dean, Medical Education, UAB School of Medicine; Edward Crump, senior director, Environmental Services, UAB Hospital; and student health, academic and student life administrators from the three campuses.
</p>
<p>
    Dr. Marrazzo is an internationally renowned expert in infectious diseases and has appeared frequently on national news as the COVID-19 crisis has unfolded. Dr. Hoesley oversees all undergraduate and graduate medical education programs at UAB and is a highly accomplished infectious disease researcher. Crump oversees all efforts to ensure that the stringent sanitary measures required at the 5.5 million-square-foot University Hospital are maintained daily.
</p>
<p>
    In announcing this initiative, Chancellor St. John said: “Our trustees expect us to use every resource available in the system for the benefit of our students, faculty and staff. We are fortunate that the scientists, doctors and staff at UAB are on the leading edge of efforts to resolve this health crisis. While it remains uncertain when students, faculty and staff will resume normal activities, no one is better positioned to develop a plan for the health and safety of our campuses than these world-class experts.”
</p>
<p>
    Plans will be developed and announced using all available research and data prior to reopening the system campuses. Once the task force has completed its work, the UA System will make the plans available to other two- and four-year colleges and universities.

    <h3 class="uk-accordion-title">What if someone is diagnosed? How will I know if I was in contact?</h3>

    <div class="uk-accordion-content">

        
        
        
                <div class="uk-margin"><p>The health and safety of the campus community is our top priority. There is a process in place to make appropriate assessments and notifications to those who may have been exposed to a confirmed case of COVID-19. How the University needs to respond will depend on the circumstances. In accordance with health department protocols and federal privacy laws, notifications and/or details will be determined based on who needs to know for health reasons.</p>
<p>Alabama and Jefferson County are experiencing community spread of COVID-19. UAB has taken proactive steps to fight the pandemic (e.g., online/alternative classes, limited business operations, aggressive social distancing), but we expect people to have questions about how they may be notified if they were in contact with someone who tested positive as testing increases in Birmingham. Based on requirements regarding student, employee and patient privacy, we are limited in what health information can be shared, but UAB is working closely with the Alabama Department of Public Health and Jefferson County Department of Health.</p>
<p>The health department gathers and provides verified tests, contacts the case, determines the contacts at risk, and notifies them of what to do. If an individual is determined to have been in close contact with someone who has been diagnosed, ADPH – or an official designee (which could be UAB Student or Employee Health, or Human Resources) – will contact that individual to discuss next steps.</p></div>

    If you think you have been exposed to someone with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19, <a href="https://www.uab.edu/news/images/2018/images/covid19/What_to_do_if_you_were_potentially_exposed_to_someone_with_confirmed_coronavirus_disease.pdf" target="_blank">follow these steps to monitor your health to avoid spreading the disease to others if you get sick</a>. Stay home except to get medical care
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Separate yourself from other people and animals in your home</li>
<li>Call ahead before visiting your doctor</li>
<li>Wear a face mask when you are around other people</li>
<li>Cover your coughs and sneezes</li>
<li><a href="https://youtu.be/cViNneQbPyA" target="_blank">Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds or use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer</a></li>
<li>Avoid sharing personal household items like dishes, cups, towels and bedding</li>
<li>Clean all “high-touch” surfaces every day with a household cleaning spray or wipe</li>
<li>Monitor your symptoms and let your healthcare provider know you are experiencing symptoms that may be related to COVID-19</li>
<li>If you are told to go to the doctor’s office, wear a face mask before entering the facility</li>
</ul>
<p>If you get sick with fever, cough or shortness of breath (even if your symptoms are very mild), you likely have COVID-19. You should isolate yourself at home and away from other people. If you have any of the following conditions that may increase your risk for a serious infection—age 60 years or older, are pregnant, or have medical conditions—contact your physician’s office and tell them that you were exposed to someone with COVID-19. They may want to monitor your health more closely or test you for COVID-19.</p>
<p>If you do not have a high-risk condition but want medical advice, call your healthcare provider and tell them you were exposed to someone with COVID-19. Your healthcare provider can help you decide if you need to be evaluated in person. There are currently no medications to treat COVID-19.</p>
<p>If you have a medical emergency and need to call 911, notify the dispatch personnel that you may have been exposed to COVID-19. If possible, put on a facemask before emergency medical services arrive or immediately after they arrive.</p>

In either of these cases, and until further notice, the research must not require interventions or interactions with human subjects.

    <h3 class="uk-accordion-title">What is telecommuting?</h3>

    <div class="uk-accordion-content">

<p>Telecommuting is a work arrangement in which an employee is permitted to work from home or another approved location for all or part of the employee’s workweek. It is a work alternative that is appropriate only for some employees and positions. Telecommuting requires supervisory approval.</p></div>
        
        
        
        
    </div>


    <h3 class="uk-accordion-title">Who decides whether a position or employee is suitable for telecommuting?</h3>

                <div class="uk-margin"><p>
    While not all positions are eligible to work remotely, a temporary arrangement can be viable in circumstances where the employee and work are compatible. Working remotely should be discussed and approved in advance. Organizational leaders will identify which functions must continue, how they will continue and the staffing levels necessary to support these functions. HR has provided a flowchart to assist organizational leaders with making this business decision.

<p>Ask and assess what resources you may need to safely and successfully perform your work duties at home.</p>

    <h3 class="uk-accordion-title">Why is telecommuting necessary?</h3>

    <div class="uk-accordion-content">

        
        
        
                <div class="uk-margin"><p>
    If the University decides it is necessary to adjust normal business operations, departments are encouraged to develop a business continuity plan for possible future limited UAB business operations up to 14 days. If a decision is made to transition to limited functions, critical business functions will be sustained by identifying which functions must continue, how they will continue and the staffing levels necessary to support these functions. Unit leaders will determine which functions must continue onsite and which functions can be effectively delivered remotely, or not needed at all during a possible period of limited operations.

    <h3 class="uk-accordion-title">What’s most important to starting a productive telecommuting arrangement?</h3>

    <div class="uk-accordion-content">

        
        
        
                <div class="uk-margin"><p>
    When evaluating whether a telecommuting arrangement is necessary, managers and employees should clearly outline and execute telecommuting arrangements. Managers should articulate clear procedures regarding check-in times and hours of availability. With proper planning, communications problems can be minimized. Indeed, well-planned flexible work arrangements sometimes enable departments to extend their service hours, and to make more effective use of space and equipment.

<p>
    The Office of Education Abroad will encourage faculty leaders to redevelop their courses to be facilitated at UAB. Please watch for further communication from your faculty member. If you individually purchased airfare, refund considerations will be collected by the Office of Education Abroad with proof that the air carrier will not issue a refund or flight credit due to the worldwide pandemic.

<p>
    The Office of Education Abroad encourages students to work with their academic advisors to identify alternative courses to ensure their academic progress.

<p>
    UAB Education Abroad will be working to refund any fees paid directly to our office, including the admin fee and faculty led program fees, via original payment. This may take a little time with UAB limited business operations but we will notify you when this has occurred. If you applied for summer 2020 scholarships, we encourage you to consider applying for a future term, as your effort this summer will not go unnoticed.
</p>
<p>
    We are saddened by the worldwide effects of the pandemic, including the impact on your study abroad plans. However, we hope you understand that your health is our highest priority and that this decision has not been taken lightly. We understand that this information may be overwhelming, but please know that the university stands ready to assist students with these resources.</p>
<p>We sincerely hope that you’ll consider studying abroad in the future — our team stands ready to assist you with deferring your plans.

    <div class="uk-accordion-content">

        
        
        
                <div class="uk-margin"><p>
 
    UAB students, faculty and staff,</p>

<p>As we continue in partnership with the UA System to implement our <a href="https://www.uab.edu/coronavirus/reentry">phased approach</a> to gradually <a href="https://www.uab.edu/coronavirus/reentry/uab-united?utm_source=StudentHome&utm_medium=UABWeb&utm_campaign=UABUnited">unite on campus</a>, UAB and UAB Medicine strive to be the safest campus in America and keep health and safety our top priority. Among many other strategies, we are adopting <a href="https://www.uab.edu/coronavirus/reentry/covid-19-testing">sentinel testing</a> as an additional layer to minimize risk and support a continued re-entry. </p>

<p>The sentinel testing system collects information useful for monitoring trends in diseases and pathogens. We plan to test between 2.5% to 5% of the on-campus population weekly to detect how COVID-19 may be circulating among our asymptomatic population. The test will be a self-administered swab of the nostril. <a href="https://www.uab.edu/coronavirus/reentry/covid-19-testing">Click here for additional information and frequently asked questions about sentinel testing.</a> </p>

<p>

This random sentinel COVID-19 testing of those who have returned to campus will begin the week of July 6. Those selected for testing will receive an email on the Sunday of the week they are to be tested, with instructions on how and where to get tested. 
</p>

<p>
Submitting to sentinel testing is voluntary. Your choice to participate or not will in no way impact your employment or your status as a student.  Nevertheless, we hope that you will participate and help us in the fight against this virus. Sentinel testing will supplement <a href="https://www.uab.edu/news/campus/item/11404-governor-ivey-announces-covid-19-testing-safety-programs-developed-by-uab-and-the-state-department-of-public-health-to-support-higher-ed-statewide">mandatory COVID-19 testing for returning students</a> through the Testing for Alabama program announced on June 29. Additional testing strategies for employees are being explored.

    <h3 class="uk-accordion-title"><span id="studenttesting">COVID-19 testing for students this fall  </span>Monday, June 29 at 10 a.m.</h3>

                <div class="uk-margin"><p>
    UAB students, faculty and staff,</p>
<p>To promote health and safety on campus as part of our comprehensive reentry planning, all UAB students returning for the fall semester will receive a free COVID-19 test, supported by CARES Act funding through the State of Alabama. Throughout the semester, random, voluntary sentinel testing will be provided to some students to help identify trends and potential problem areas.</p>
<p>In partnership with the University of Alabama System, UAB has led an effort with the State of Alabama to create the Testing for Alabama program. Through the program, all students of two- and four-year higher education institutions can receive a free COVID-19 reentry test. Read the announcement at <a href="https://www.uab.edu/news/campus/item/11404">UAB news online</a>.</p>
<p>Protocols for how testing will be administered are being developed. We anticipate the test will likely be either a swab in the nostril — though not the more invasive nasopharyngeal swab — or an oral saline gargle test that we currently have under development. </p>
<p>Our ability to test every student returning to campus will go a long way in helping us maintain a safe environment. We are excited that, through our partnership with Governor Kay Ivey and the State Department of Health, we can have a broader impact in our state by helping make testing available to public colleges and universities throughout Alabama.</p>
<p>On our campus, testing will supplement other strategies to maintain a safe environment, like the <a href="https://www.staysafetogether.org/">Stay Safe Together™</a> platform that includes our COVID assessment healthcheck symptom monitoring tool. UAB is also developing a voluntary exposure notification app powered by Apple and Google that we look forward to rolling out in the coming weeks. </p>
<p>In addition to COVID-19 testing for students through Testing for Alabama, a sentinel testing system for on-campus faculty and staff was piloted in June and will be implemented broadly starting on July 8. Additional testing strategies for employees are being explored. </p>
<p>Updates will be communicated to students through the Greenmail newsletter, and to faculty and staff in eReporter.  </p>

                <div class="uk-margin"><p>
    UAB students, faculty and staff,</p>

<p>As UAB continues our phased, gradual <a href="https://www.uab.edu/coronavirus/reentry">reentry to campus</a>, we want to assure you that our COVID-19 safety protocols, based on the input of infectious disease and public health experts, will be enforced to help promote the health of our community and the continuity of our mission. </p>

<p>We know that creating and maintaining a culture of safety will require awareness, vigilance, monitoring, effective structures for reporting concerns and corrective action for non-compliance.</p> 

<p>We need to be <a href="https://www.uab.edu/coronavirus/reentry/uab-united">united for our common good</a>, and each of us has a role to play.</p> 

<p>UAB’s <a href="https://www.uab.edu/coronavirus/reentry/expectations-guidelines">Reentry Expectations and Guidelines</a> are posted online at <a href="http://uab.edu/reentry">uab.edu/reentry</a>, as are <a href="https://www.uab.edu/coronavirus/reentry/personal-safety-practices">Personal Safety Practices</a>. Everyone who returns to campus is expected to comply fully with these safety protocols and any specialized guidance from their particular departments/units/schools. We also ask that — to protect the UAB family and our broader community — you practice safety guidelines when you are off campus. </p>

<p>If you observe that health and safety rules are not being observed or enforced on campus, discuss your concerns with your supervisor. If non-compliance persists, you may contact Human Resources or report it anonymously through the <a href="https://www.uab.edu/ethics/file-a-report-online/options">UAB Ethics Hotline</a>. Anyone who reports non-compliance is protected against retaliation, and concerns of retaliation should be reported to Human Resources or the Office of Compliance and Risk Assurance.</p>

<p>Persistent failure or willful disregard for health and safety protocols by any employee or student will result in consequences consistent with UAB’s discipline policies for <a href="https://www.uab.edu/policies/content/Pages/UAB-HR-POL-0000230.html#:~:text=Abstract%3A,listed%20and%20described%20in%20detail.">staff</a>, <a href="https://www.uab.edu/policies/Pages/Faculty-Handbook.html">faculty</a> and <a href="https://www.uab.edu/policies/content/Pages/UAB-UC-POL-0000781.html">students</a>.</p>

<p>We are committed to preserving the health of the communities in which we live, learn and work, and the safety precautions we have adopted and will continue to adopt to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic apply to everyone equally. By observing them, we are confident we can continue to teach and learn, research, support Alabama’s social and economic needs, and deliver vital patient care.</p>

<p>Students, please continue to read the Greenmail e-newsletter every Wednesday for important announcements and details about reentry.

    UAB students, faculty and staff,</p>
 
<p>Our <a href="http://www.uab.edu/reentry">gradual re-entry to campus</a> continues and is going well, as is our planning with the University of Alabama System for a safe return this fall with a hybrid model – a course delivery system which, because of social distancing precautions, requires a combination of both in-person instruction and remote instruction. To promote the health and safety of the campus community, adjustments have been made to the fall semester schedule:</p>
 
<ul>
<li>Fall semester hybrid classes will start Monday, Aug. 24, 2020.</li>
<li>Fall semester hybrid classes will end Friday, Nov. 20, for the Thanksgiving break.</li>
<li>Students will not return to campus after Thanksgiving break. </li>
<li>Exceptions can be granted for students based on work, research or clinical responsibilities, and accommodations can be requested for international students or others who do not have alternate living arrangements.  </li>
<li>Classes during the week of Nov. 30-Dec. 4, as well as final exams during the week of Dec. 7-11, will be conducted remotely.<br>
<em>Coursework engagement during these weeks is necessary to accommodate <a href="https://sacscoc.org/accrediting-standards/">SACSCOC accrediting standard</a> requirements for credit granted for coursework. </em></li>
</ul>

<p>Additional information for our phased re-entry to campus (including details about on-campus housing, classroom protocols, personal protective equipment, and COVID-19 training and testing) continue to be worked out and will be communicated in the coming days and weeks. UAB’s e-newsletters are your source of official information. To stay informed of the latest news and updates, students are encouraged read Greenmail each Wednesday, and faculty and staff are encouraged to read eReporter each Tuesday and Friday.

The Health System is on a separate plan to transition from the Limited Business Model and began resuming clinical operations in early May. </p></strong>
 
<p>UAB faculty and staff,
    
</p>
 <p>
    Earlier this week, the university announced a gradual, phased approach to campus re-entry detailed at <a href="http://www.uab.edu/reentry">www.uab.edu/reentry</a>. 
</p>

 <p>
   Phase I, which is set for May 26 through June 15, includes the gradual re-entry of some individuals with clinical or research responsibilities. This time period is a window in which individuals approved to return in this phase will begin campus re-entry; not everyone in Phase I will return May 26.  
</p>

<p>
   Before individuals in Phase I (or any future phase) re-enter campus, several steps must be completed: 
</p> 

<ol>
<li>Supervisors will draft a unit-specific operational re-entry plan and submit it for approval.</li>
<li>Subsequently, you will receive an email from Campus Learning (<span id="cloak12d751f060a30931146500c0b7be71ff">This email address is being protected from spambots. You need JavaScript enabled to view it.</span><script type='text/javascript'>

<li>After you complete the required training and health check, your supervisor will be notified that you are approved to return to campus.</li>
</ol>
 
<p>No one is permitted to return to campus until they have completed these steps and have clearance for re-entry from their supervisor. When you return, you must follow all safety guidelines. You should not initiate training modules until you receive prompts from Campus Learning by email. This is to verify that UAB personnel have completed their training.</p>
 

<p><a href="https://www.uab.edu/coronavirus/reentry/reentry-to-campus-checklist">Re-entry checklists are available</a> to guide students, faculty and staff as they prepare for their return to campus and when they are on campus. </p>

<p>At this time, not everyone will know into which re-entry phase they fit and when they will be approved to return. Contact your supervisor with questions about your phase. We will continue to support units in the development of their required operational plans so updates can be provided.</p>

The Health System is on a separate plan to transition from the Limited Business Model and began resuming clinical operations in early May.</a> </p></strong>

<p>
On Tuesday, May 26, UAB will transition from the university’s Limited Business Model into Modified Business Operations. During Modified Business Operations, UAB will begin a gradual, phased approach with some groups/functions returning to campus before others. </p>
<p>
It is important to gradually bring individuals back on campus to promote social distancing. This phased approach will also allow us to evaluate strategies for effectiveness and minimize risk. </p>
<p>
<strong>Only *students, faculty and staff who are part of an approved unit operational plan will be permitted to return to campus during this phase and will be responsible for strictly following safety guidelines and requirements in place to minimize potential risk. Clinical and research personnel will be the first to return to campus following the approval of units’ operational plans.</strong></p>
 
<p><em>*Students: Students in clinical areas must receive approval from their program to return to campus. Researchers at post-doctoral and graduate/pre-doctoral levels may continue or initiate studies on site following approved unit operational plans to ensure the safe return to campus. Other trainees engaged in research, such as undergraduate students and volunteers, must request approval through the <a href="https://www.uab.edu/coronavirus/images/documents/reentry/r2ops-operational-plan-template-undergraduates.doc">Office of Research exception process</a>.</em></p>
<p>
UAB is fortunate to have extensive expertise in several disciplines that was utilized on UAB and University of Alabama System task forces to craft well-informed re-entry strategies guided by five principles:</p>
<ol>
<li>Preserve the health of our university community and Birmingham.</li>
<li>Maintain and deliver on our education, research and community engagement by continuing to recruit and enroll students, teach those students, conduct research, and help stimulate the Alabama economy.</li>
<li>Preserve and maintain university operations necessary to support mission-critical activities, both now and into the future.</li>
<li>Treat students and employees fairly and equitably.</li>
<li>Remain fiscally solvent now and into the future so as to be able to deliver on mission-critical activities for the long term.</li>
</ol>
<p>
Detailed plans and guidance to minimize risk and promote quality outcomes across all mission pillars are available at <a href="http://www.uab.edu/reentry">uab.edu/reentry</a> and cover many areas:
<ul>
<li>Required web-based training (as soon as available; in development)</li>
<li>Symptom and exposure tracking and contact tracing (as soon as available; in development) 
<li>COVID-19 testing</li> 
<li>Guidance for high-risk individuals</li>
<li>Phased staffing plans and staffing options </li>
<li>Personal protective equipment (including masks/face coverings, gloves, etc.)</li>
<li>Social distancing</li>
<li>Hygiene (handwashing, hand sanitizers, cough/sneeze etiquette)</li>
<li>Public transportation/Blazer Express  </li>
<li>Enhanced environmental health and cleaning procedures</li>
<li>Protocols in offices, reception areas, elevators, labs, classrooms, outdoor areas, etc.</li>
<li>Mental and emotional well-being</li>
<li>Enter/Exit control</li>
</ul>
<p>
Guidance and requirements are subject to change and will be updated prior to future phases of re-entry, including a return to in-person instruction. </p>

<h3>
    Anticipated Phased Approach Timeline
</h3>
<p>We anticipate restrictions and limitations in activities will be in place for the next 12 to 18 months. After evaluating several factors, including the trending numbers of new COVID-19 cases in our community, our testing capability and availability, our ability to monitor the spread of the virus in the campus community, the adequacy of community health care resources, current supply levels of personal protective equipment, and applicable federal, state and local directives, we developed the following color code system to coordinate and integrate operational procedures across UAB. </p>
<p>
The active color code will be determined based upon state, local or UA System restrictions and conditions. Changes in the prevailing code will be announced by UAB leadership in response to the changing circumstances. Each level defines a different set of work criteria rules and regulations and operational plans.</p>

<p>The COVID-19 pandemic is a dynamic situation that continues to evolve, and our response will inevitably evolve as well. We will therefore update these guidelines and the protocols outlined below as necessary to continue to ensure the health and safety of the campus community. As of mid-May, we are working toward implementing guidelines for the Yellow/Modified Business Operations level as research and clinical activities resume.  </p>

<h3>
    Productivity in Modified Business Operations 
</h3>
<p>In March, UAB — in partnership with the University of Alabama System — announced a Limited Business Model to slow the spread of COVID-19. In the initial phase of Limited Business, staff in <a href="https://www.uab.edu/humanresources/home/wfgroups">Workgroups A (academic staff) and C (clinical staff)</a> were assigned to one of three sub-groups:</p>
<ul>
<li>Group 1: Needed to continue work in-person</li>
<li>Group 2: Needed to continue work but can do so remotely</li>
<li>Group 3: Not needed to work during a time of limited business </li>
</ul>

<p><em>Note: <a href="file:///C:/Users/computer/AppData/Local/Packages/Microsoft.MicrosoftEdge_8wekyb3d8bbwe/TempState/Downloads/USE THE EMPLOYEE WORKFORCE APP TO CHECK YOUR WORKGROUP">Workgroup assignments (i.e., A, C, F) can be checked via the UAB Employee Workforce App online.</a> Subgroup assignments (i.e., 1, 2, 3) are determined by an employee’s unit leadership/supervisor.</em></p>

<p>During the initial eight-week phase of Limited Business, employees — even those who could not work — continued to receive regular compensation while the financial and operational impact of COVID-19 was assessed. As Limited Business was prolonged, we could not continue to pay employees who could not work. </p>

<p>Effective May 10, all staff in <a href="https://www.uab.edu/humanresources/home/wfgroups">Workgroup A</a> Group 3 and a limited number of staff in <a href="https://www.uab.edu/humanresources/home/wfgroups">Workgroup A</a> Group 2 were placed on temporary furlough (May 10-July 31). Furloughed individuals are those who — by the nature of their work — could not do their jobs remotely or who serve in roles for which demand decreased or would decrease to a critical point during the furlough period. Some units exercised discretion and addressed unit-specific budget shortfalls by placing additional staff on furlough status who had worked effectively during the Limited Business model. No UAB Medicine staff in <a href="https://www.uab.edu/humanresources/home/wfgroups">Workgroup C</a> were placed on furlough due to the anticipated return to clinical operations as the hospital and clinics reopen. </p>

<p>As a result of furloughs effective May 10, remaining <a href="https://www.uab.edu/humanresources/home/wfgroups">Workgroup A</a> staff are those who can work effectively during Modified Business Operations according to their supervisor. As such, non-furloughed staff in <a href="https://www.uab.edu/humanresources/home/wfgroups">Workgroup A</a> are expected to maintain a state of full productivity in Modified Business Operations. Employees with questions are encouraged to ask their designated Human Resources representative. </p>

<h3>
    Next Steps
</h3>
<p>Individuals who have responsibilities described within each of the phases and are anticipated to return to campus, and their supervisors, will be contacted with specific guidance as soon as possible, and updates and information will continue to be added to <a href="http://www.uab.edu/coronavirus">uab.edu/coronavirus</a> and <a href="http://www.uab.edu/reentry">uab.edu/reentry</a>.

    <h3 class="uk-accordion-title"><span id="reduction">Update on COVID-19: Additional Expense Reductions Due to COVID-19 Crisis</span> Monday, May 4 at 12:30 p.m.</h3>

    <div class="uk-accordion-content">

        
        
        
                <div class="uk-margin">

<p>
    UAB faculty and staff,</p><p>

UAB is experiencing the harsh financial realities of the COVID-19 pandemic, as are institutions of higher education and health care worldwide. 
</p><p>
The Universities of Arizona, Kentucky, Louisville, Ohio, Oregon and Wisconsin recently joined a growing number of universities and academic medical centers to announce some combination of salary reductions, furloughs or reduced hours, layoffs, and stopping employer contributions to retirement plans. Washington University in St. Louis furloughed 1,300 employees for 90 days. The Mayo Clinic announced it would furlough or reduce hours for 30,000 employees. 
</p><p>
Many revenue streams have slowed or stopped due to the pandemic. Clinical revenue is substantially down for UAB Medicine. For the university, social distancing and other operational changes have negatively affected revenue. Without changes to our operations, the university will incur a budget shortfall of $40+ million in the remaining five months of the FY20 fiscal year ending Sept. 30, and UAB Medicine could have a $230 million budget shortfall by the end of September. Federal and state stimulus funding will address only a portion of our losses.
</p><p>
To protect our employees and the institution, beginning in March we took quick steps in partnership with the University of Alabama System to limit travel and restrict hiring and discretionary spending, among other strategies. To date, the university and UAB Medicine have been able to largely sustain uninterrupted payroll for more than seven weeks of limited business while we assessed the extent of the pandemic’s financial impact. Despite our best efforts, we must take additional actions we had hoped to avoid and delayed as long as possible. 
</p><p>
University leadership explored many options with advisory panels across campus, including Faculty Senate and Staff Council leaders, the University’s Budget Advisory Committee, and others to determine what expense reduction options should be adopted. UAB Medicine gathered input from leaders across the organization and its governing bodies to determine expense-reduction strategies.  
</p><p>
After thorough assessment and projections, we regret to announce additional university and UAB Medicine expense-reduction strategies. 
</p><p>
<strong>University Leadership Salary Reductions 
</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Effective May 1, university leadership had their salaries reduced for at least the remainder of the fiscal year as follows:  President 15%, Senior Vice Presidents 10%, Deans and Vice Presidents 7%</li></ul>

<p><strong>UAB Medicine Leadership Salary Reductions</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>UAB Medicine Senior Leaders (Including Department Chairs): 10% reduction in annual compensation, effective May 10 through Dec. 31, 2020 </li>
<li>Health System Executive Cabinet: 15% reduction in annual compensation, effective May 10 through Dec. 31, 2020 </li>
</ul>

<p>
    <strong>In addition, the university and UAB Medicine/Health System-managed entities must implement different responses to address budget shortfalls for their separate lines of business. </strong></p><p>

</p>
<h4>
<a href="https://www.uab.edu/humanresources/home/wfgroups">USE THE EMPLOYEE WORKFORCE APP TO CHECK YOUR WORKGROUP
</a></h4>

<h3>
    University Expense Reduction Strategies
    </h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>Temporary furloughs for approximately 325 university staff unable to work effectively in a remote setting, for a period effective May 10 through July 31, 2020:</strong></li><ul>
<li>Temporary furloughs will affect Workgroup A Group 3 and a limited number of university staff in <a href="https://www.uab.edu/humanresources/home/wfgroups">Workgroup A</a> Group 2. Human Resources will work with supervisors to identify and alert affected Group 2 staff as soon as possible and no later than the end of business Friday, May 8. </li>
<li>During furlough, employees retain benefits such as health insurance and are eligible for unemployment benefits and additional assistance through the CARES Act. UAB will cover the cost of both the employer and employee contributions to health plans (including employee premiums) for affected staff during the furlough period. </li>
<li><a href="https://uab.edu/humanresources/home/covid-19-resources/furlough-resources">Information for furloughed university employees is available online.</a> Employees can also contact their designated HR representative. </li>
<li>UAB HR will file claims for unemployment benefits with the Alabama Department of Labor on behalf of furloughed staff. </li>
<li>The furlough period might be shorter or longer depending on the evolving impact of the pandemic.   </li>
</ul> </ul>

<h3>Strategies for UAB Medicine/Health System-managed Entities 
    
    </h3>
<li><strong>Temporary salary reductions for many clinical faculty and <a href="https://www.uab.edu/humanresources/home/wfgroups">Workgroup C</a> staff in UAB Medicine and Health System-managed entities:</strong> </li>
<ul><li><a href="https://www.uab.edu/humanresources/home/wfgroups">Workgroup C</a> salary reductions are effective May 10 through Dec. 31, 2020. Implementation dates for School of Medicine clinical department faculty may vary slightly and will be directly communicated to those affected.</li>
<li>School of Medicine clinical department faculty salary reductions will average 7%. Specific salary reductions for <a href="https://www.uab.edu/humanresources/home/wfgroups">Workgroup C</a> will be implemented on the following sliding scale:</li>
<ul><li>Hourly wage employees making $15 or less per hour: 0% reduction in annual compensation </li>
<li>$0 – $31,200: 0% reduction in annual compensation</li>
<li>$31,201 – $50,000: 3% reduction in annual compensation</li>
<li>$50,001 – $75,000: 4% reduction in annual compensation</li>
<li>$75,001 – $125,000: 5% reduction in annual compensation</li>
<li>$125,001 – $200,000: 6% reduction in annual compensation</li>
<li>Greater than $200,000: 7% reduction in annual compensation</li>
<li>Senior Leaders (Including Department Chairs): 10% reduction in annual compensation </li>
    <li>Health System Executive Cabinet: 15% reduction in annual compensation   </li></ul></ul>
<p>
    
</p><p>
<strong>Thank you for all you have done and continue to do for our mission during this time.</strong> These actions are a reflection only of the harsh economic realities of the COVID-19 crisis, not a reflection of the value of UAB faculty and staff or their job performance. We are disappointed that this action has become necessary. 
</p><p>
We will continue to assess the crisis. Future decisions will be determined by the financial realities of the time as we work to reverse financial deficits and fight this COVID-19 pandemic. 
</p><p>
Those of you who need to take advantage of resources like the Benevolent Fund’s <a href="https://www.uab.edu/benfund/support/eeap">Employee Emergency Assistance program</a> or <a href="https://www.uab.edu/benfund/blazer-kitchen">Blazer Kitchen</a>, please do.

    <h3 class="uk-accordion-title"><span id="financial">Update on COVID-19: Financial Process, 403(b) and Fall Semester</span> Thursday, April 30 at 12:30 p.m.</h3>

    <div class="uk-accordion-content">

        
        
        
                <div class="uk-margin"><p>
    UAB Faculty and Staff,</p><p>
 
As April comes to a close, questions remain about UAB’s plans to address the financial realities of the COVID-19 crisis and plans for the fall semester.</p><p>
 
Our hope is to offer in-person instruction options in the fall – a goal we are working towards with the guidance of task forces at the UA System and UAB levels. While circumstances could ultimately limit our ability, we are working to determine the logistics that would facilitate a safe return to campus.</p><p>
 
Financially, UAB is still working through the process shared with the campus community recently. In an <a href="https://www.uab.edu/reporter/campus/take-note/item/9096-putting-people-first-the-latest-on-re-opening-campus-confronting-budget-challenges-and-more?utm_source=MC_100006781&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=200430+-+Coronavirus+-+Email&utm_content=https%3a%2f%2fwww.uab.edu%2freporter%2fcampus%2ftake-note%2fitem%2f9096-putting-people-first-the-latest-on-re-opening-campus-confronting-budget-challenges-and-more">April 16 virtual town hall</a> for faculty and staff, Vice President Allen Bolton explained the initial estimated negative impact on our budget to be between $52 million and $77 million this fiscal year. UAB Medicine has projected a possible $230 million budget shortfall by the end of September.</p><p>
 
UAB leaders have been exploring many expense reduction options with advisory panels across campus, including Faculty Senate and Staff Council leaders, the University’s Budget Advisory Committee and others to determine what options should be adopted to close that gap.
 </p><p>
<strong>At this time, employer matches/contributions to voluntary 403(b) retirement plans will be temporarily suspended or reduced in accordance with the requirements of the plans. For university employees, this will start in May and last through September 2020. Because the health system has a larger budget shortfall than the university, it will also start this action in May but will extend it through December 2020. Details will be communicated directly with individuals who participate in these plans.</strong></p><p>
 
We continue to work on a comprehensive plan in coordination with UAB Medicine that should be final no later than next week. The good news is, due to new information and projections this week, our projected budget shortfall is several million dollars less than originally estimated. This is positive, allowing us to revisit the extent of expense reduction options needed in addition to our hiring and spending restrictions already in place.
 </p><p>
It remains our goal to minimize the disruption to our valued faculty and staff, which is why we have taken the appropriate time to ensure that estimates are accurate and actions we ultimately take are absolutely necessary. As we assess strategies, we are thoughtfully considering the timing of any announcement. 
 </p><p>
Our work to finalize a comprehensive plan continues, and we will keep you informed as soon as we have new information. Thank you for all of your efforts on behalf of our multifaceted mission.
 </p><p>
Sincerely, 
Ray L. Watts
President, UAB

<p>
    I want to thank President Ray Watts, Dr. Will Ferniany, Provost Pam Benoit, Dr. Selwyn Vickers and the faculty and the staff who are working tirelessly during these difficult times to provide meaningful support and uninterrupted teaching to students at the University of Alabama at Birmingham. </p><p>
  
The entire UA System – UA, UAB, UAH and the UAB Health System – is committed to using all possible resources to reopen our campuses and resume normal activities.  It is not a matter of <strong>IF</strong>, but one of <strong>WHEN</strong>. </p><p>

We are extremely fortunate that UAB, home to one of the world’s foremost academic medical centers, is part of our System.  With knowledge and guidance from the scientists, doctors, researchers and numerous higher education experts on our campuses, we are developing comprehensive plans to make sure our three campuses are <strong>the safest in America</strong> when our students return. </p><p>

We have established a System-wide Task Force to consider strategies of all kinds: testing measures, enhanced cleaning, classroom procedures, housing policies, security and wellness programs, and more.  We will update you about timelines on our website (<a href="http://www.uasystem.edu/">www.uasystem.edu</a>) and through future email communication from the UAB leadership team.

                <div class="uk-margin"><p>
    UAB students, faculty and staff,</p><p>
 
Thank you all for your hard work and understanding in this time of change and uncertainty.  Your Blazer spirit is essential to keeping our UAB community safe and to ensuring our ability to serve and educate effectively. </p><p>
 
As part of the University of Alabama System Office’s 24/7 planning to safeguard our campus community, it has developed an <a href="http://uasystem.edu/assets/2020/04/Policy-Update-Summer-Term-20200408.pdf" target="_blank">Updated Interim Emergency Policy regarding summer classes</a>. Given that the majority of our summer courses offered after June 22 have already transitioned to an online format, we will <strong>not</strong> offer in-person/on-site classes for summer 2020. All instruction will be delivered remotely using the most effective tools available. </p><p>

Students, please work with your faculty members to access materials and utilize all the teaching and learning tools we have posted for you. Although classes are not being taught in person this spring or summer, our faculty is delivering a full array of courses through remote teaching. This <a href="/coronavirus/info-for-you/faculty/#summer-2020-semester-faqs">FAQ</a> provides important details regarding laboratories, in-person research, residence halls and campus dining, in addition to grading methods and other important updates.</p><p>
 
As we have previously announced, we will not hold in-person orientations or commencement ceremonies until further notice. We have online programming prepared for both. All of you who look forward to participating in a future graduation ceremony on campus will have that opportunity as soon as on-campus operations are restored and scheduled.
 </p><p>
We remain committed to delivering on our mission, vision and shared values to create knowledge that will change the world.

    UAB was notified this afternoon that a campus community member tested positive for COVID-19 today, March 31, 2020. The safety and well-being of the community is UAB's top priority, so we are providing this notification out of an abundance of caution.

State and local health departments have protocols for testing and advising cases – including contact tracing and notifying individuals who may have been exposed. Public health authorities determine what information is shared publicly in the interest of health and in accordance with privacy requirements.

<li>Faculty (<a href="https://www.uab.edu/humanresources/home/wfgroups">Workgroup F</a>) involved in activities that require a presence at their work location (e.g., patient care or essential research) should continue to report to their place of work.

If you have questions, consult your supervisor.</li>
<li>For guidance on research activities, please see <a href="/coronavirus/info-for-you/researchers">Resources for Researchers on uab.edu/coronavirus</a>. </li>
<li>UAB Hospital never closes and continues to prepare to safely isolate and care for COVID-19 patients.
</li></ul></strong>
<p>
    UAB faculty and staff (including student/employee workers),</p><p>

We often say UAB’s people are our most valuable resource, and we sincerely thank you for all you do for UAB and our community in this challenging time. We continue to monitor the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic and carefully plan in an attempt to minimize disruptions while maintaining critical functions in a safe environment. </p><p>

As you know, UAB announced an initial 14-day limited business model in mid-March for <a href="https://www.uab.edu/humanresources/home/wfgroups">Workgroups A and C</a>. <strong>We are now extending the duration of the limited business model — as it is now — for <a href="https://www.uab.edu/humanresources/home/wfgroups">Workgroups A and C</a> until or unless notified otherwise by their supervisor.</strong> </p><p>

All employees who are working remotely, or unable to perform their jobs remotely, will continue under the same conditions and circumstances as previously announced – including pay and benefits.  We will continue to update and inform you of any changes to this policy, and your supervisor will notify you of any changes to your work group, taking into account the need to stagger campus visit times and <a href="/coronavirus/social-distancing">maintain social distancing</a> at all times.  
</p><p>
As a reminder, the categories of employees in Limited Business Model <a href="https://www.uab.edu/humanresources/home/wfgroups">Workgroup A and C</a> are (employees are assigned to the appropriate group by their unit leadership/supervisor and should follow supervisor instructions): </p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://www.uab.edu/humanresources/home/wfgroups">Workgroup A and C</a>, Group 1: Those who will continue work in-person and continue to be paid at the normal rate. <strong>Do not come to work if you are sick, and continue to practice social distancing and good hygiene.</strong></li>
<ul>
<li>Supervisors should make every effort <strong>to not include student-employees in Workgroup A or C, Group 1 on-campus work</strong>. If a supervisor thinks a student’s role is essential, approval must be granted by HR before a student is assigned to Workgroup A or C, Group 1. </li>    
    </ul>
<li><a href="https://www.uab.edu/humanresources/home/wfgroups">Workgroup A and C</a>, Group 2: Those who will continue work but can do so from home and continue to be paid at the normal rate.</li>
<ul>
 <li>Read UAB’s <a href="https://www.uab.edu/news/images/2018/images/covid19/GUIDELINES_FOR_TEMPORARY_TELECOMMUTING.pdf">temporary telecommuting guidance</a> and fill out and <a href="https://powerforms.docusign.net/58ce1541-732a-4a7e-90a2-fe19420c3a6e?env=na3-eu1&amp;acct=097de7a9-05d2-49f4-9572-521df6d32f4a">sign the telecommuting agreement</a> if you have not already. If you completed a telecommuting agreement for the initial 14-day limited business phase, you <strong>do not</strong> need to fill it out a second time. </li>
<li>Working from home can be challenging. For the short- and long-term health of our institution and our vital mission, managing those challenges to remain productive is imperative. Communicate with your supervisor and/or speak with your Human Resources representative for guidance. </li>
<li>Your group assignment is subject to change if business needs arise. </li>   
    </ul>
<li><a href="https://www.uab.edu/humanresources/home/wfgroups">Workgroup A and C</a>, Group 3: Those who will not work during a time of limited business and will continue to receive normal pay and benefits until or unless notified otherwise by their supervisor.   </li><ul>
<li>Unfortunately, the COVID-19 pandemic makes it necessary to limit on-campus personnel to only those whose functions are imperative during limited business operations — and not all functions can be done remotely or are required under extreme circumstances.  </li>
<li><a href="https://www.uab.edu/humanresources/home/wfgroups">Workgroup A and C</a>, Group 3, may be called upon to perform duties (on-site or remotely) within the employee’s skill set but outside of the employee’s job description.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.uab.edu/humanresources/home/wfgroups">Workgroup A and C</a>, Group 3 employees will continue to be paid during the limited business period until or unless notified otherwise by their supervisor. In the event of a prolonged disruption that requires this policy to change, leadership will work with all sources (federal, state, etc.) in an effort to continue financial support of our employees. UAB is <a href="https://www.uab.edu/fightcovid19/give" target="_blank">raising funds to help those affected by COVID-19</a>. Students in need of assistance can request a COVID-19 <a href="https://padlock.idm.uab.edu/cas/login?service=https%3A%2F%2Fcm.maxient.com%2Freportingform.php%3FUnivofAlabamaBirmingham%26layout_id%3D16">emergency grant</a>. Employees in need of assistance can pursue the <a href="https://www.uab.edu/benfund/support/eeap">Employee Emergency Assistance Program</a>.</li>
<li>If you need to go to campus to get critical personal belongings, coordinate with your supervisor for approval and to stagger timing with others to minimize personal contact. Absolutely do not go to campus if you are sick.  </li>
<li>Your group assignment is subject to change if business needs arise. </li></ul>
</ol>
<em><strong><p>
NOTE: Unit leaders/supervisors will assign and communicate group assignments within Workgroup A and C.</p></strong></em><p>

Employment and pay for Federal Work Study students will be handled per current federal guidance.</p><p>

UAB — working within the framework of the <a href="http://uasystem.edu/news/2020/02/ua-system-covid-19-updates/">proactive COVID-19 planning led by The University of Alabama System</a> — will maintain health and safety as our top priority. We are committed to making prudent decisions and communicating regularly.</p><p>

Please take care of yourself and each other as much as possible.

 </p></strong>
<p>Students, faculty and staff,</p><p>

 
Thank you for your efforts to minimize the spread of novel coronavirus (COVID-19). In the midst of an extremely unsettling time, the Blazer community has come together to make sacrifices and support one another. Please continue to <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prepare/prevention.html">practice aggressive social distancing and good hygiene</a> so we can “<a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2020/03/13/815502262/flattening-a-pandemics-curve-why-staying-home-now-can-save-lives">flatten the curve</a>” and save lives.</p><p>
When we announced the online/alternative instruction format March 12, it was unclear how long it would last. It is now clear that in-person instruction will not be possible for the remainder of the semester.</p><p>

As part of the ongoing <a href="http://uasystem.edu/ua-system-coronavirus-information-and-resources/">University of Alabama System Office planning</a> to safeguard our campus community, UAB and our sister campuses are announcing today that there will be <strong>no more in-person/on-site classes for the duration of the spring semester</strong>. Instead of on-campus commencement ceremonies this spring, UAB will host virtual/alternative commencement ceremonies.  </p><p>
 
This is an unprecedented situation, but UAB remains committed to minimizing disruptions while keeping health and safety our top priority. Additional logistics will be communicated in the coming days, but here are details we know now:</p><p>
 
</p><h3>Online and Alternative Teaching
    </h3><p>
The UAB spring semester will resume Wednesday, March 25, in an <strong>online/alternative format</strong>. All instruction will be delivered remotely using the most effective tools available. Students should work with their instructors to access materials and utilize <a href="https://www.uab.edu/elearning/students">resources</a>, an <a href="/coronavirus/info-for-you/undergraduate-students#online-remote-learning-faqs">online FAQ</a> and <a href="https://www.uab.edu/reporter/know-more/teaching-learning/item/9067-tips-for-success-from-experienced-online-students">guidance</a> to help them succeed in this format. Faculty have been provided <a href="https://www.uab.edu/elearning/faculty/teachingremote?utm_source=MC_100006781&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=200310+-+Coronavirus+-+Faculty+-+Online+Prep+Site&amp;utm_content=this+site">eLearning</a> and <a href="https://www.uab.edu/it/home/remote-work">IT resources</a>, as well as <a href="https://www.uab.edu/reporter/know-more/teaching-learning/item/9061-online-teaching-veterans-share-their-top-tips">peer guidance</a>. Policies regarding clinical and research requirements, student-teacher programs and other specific professional programs will be formulated based on guidance from the state of Alabama and the appropriate academic departments and governing agencies.</p><p>
 
</p><h3>Virtual/Alternative Commencement Ceremonies</h3><p>

We are deeply disappointed that our graduating Blazers will not experience a traditional commencement this spring, but we will do everything we can to recognize and celebrate your accomplishments. There are several commencement ceremonies each spring, and details of each virtual/alternative commencement will be communicated in the coming days and weeks. This announcement is being made now to best accommodate the logistics of graduating students and their families, as well as campus departments. Additional information about this and other opportunities will be provided.</p><p>
 
</p><h3>Residence Halls</h3><p>

Now that we know on-campus instruction will not take place this semester, we can begin to make decisions and provide guidance to allow students to move out of their residence hall rooms. We are formulating a plan now to allow a systematic and safe way for students to retrieve their belongings and move out. <strong>This plan will be shared in a separate communication directly to residential students.</strong> 
 
Students, please <strong>DO NOT RETURN TO CAMPUS</strong> at this time. <strong>It remains vitally important to aggressively promote social distancing and “<a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2020/03/13/815502262/flattening-a-pandemics-curve-why-staying-home-now-can-save-lives">flatten the curve</a>.”</strong> Students should email <span id="cloak80c697798f2c158466baf8cfde4d299c">This email address is being protected from spambots.

		</script> if an extreme hardship or circumstance arises. Students are not authorized to return to campus outside of this plan, and any who show up without authorization will not be accommodated. </p>
 
Now that on-campus classes will not resume this semester, a plan will be communicated in the near future regarding residential student housing fees and meal plans.
 
Transportation Services continues to discuss parking issues and will provide further guidance in the future.

UAB Community, </p><p>

Mike Saag, M.D., a physician in the UAB Division of Infectious Disease, has tested positive for the novel coronavirus (COVID-19). He wishes to make his case known as an example of the COVID-19 reality and the importance of practicing aggressive social distancing.

<strong><p style="border: 1px solid #80BC00; padding: 10px; text-align: center;">UAB is complex. Changes to work schedules mean different things to employees and can be confusing. If you have questions about the following guidance, please ask your supervisor or HR contact. </p></strong>


<p>
 
 
UAB faculty and staff (including student employees/workers),</p><p>
 
Late Friday, a state of emergency was declared for Alabama and the nation to address the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. This announcement — which includes the closing of K-12 schools statewide starting Wednesday at 5 p.m. and relaxing absentee policies in some schools for the beginning of the week — has prompted concerns and questions about UAB policies that address remote work, essential staffing and child care issues.</p><p>
 
With guidance from Human Resources, leaders across the university have been working to assess resources and staffing needs, and will be moving to a limited business model. <strong>Based on the latest COVID-19 developments and the need to minimize in-person contact, UAB (university) will begin transitioning to a limited business model for employees in <a href="https://www.uab.edu/humanresources/home/wfgroups">Workgroup A</a> starting Monday, March 16, to be fully implemented by 5 p.m. The limited business model will be in place for at least 14 days starting March 17.</strong></p><p>
 
<strong>Again, the following information about a limited business model applies ONLY to <a href="https://www.uab.edu/humanresources/home/wfgroups">Workgroup A</a>. Faculty (<a href="https://www.uab.edu/humanresources/home/wfgroups">Workgroup F</a>) are asked to work remotely IF POSSIBLE (e.g., if you are instructing online, do so from your home, not campus), and come to campus only if required (e.g., direct patient care or research responsibilities that require a physical presence on campus). If you have questions, consult with your supervisor. Instructions and updates for employees in <a href="https://www.uab.edu/humanresources/home/wfgroups">Workgroup C</a> and those at Children’s of Alabama will be forthcoming from the UAB Health System and School of Medicine.</strong></p><p>
 
This limited business model identifies employees in <a href="https://www.uab.edu/humanresources/home/wfgroups">Workgroup A</a> who are:
</p><ul>
<li>needed to continue work in-person (Limited Business Model Workgroup A, Group 1)</li>
<li>needed to continue work but can do so from home (Limited Business Model Workgroup A, Group 2)</li>
<li>not needed to work during a time of limited business (Limited Business Model Workgroup A, Group 3)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong><em>NOTE: Unit leaders/supervisors will assign and communicate group assignments within Workgroup A.</em></strong></p><p>
Early data suggests a limited business model may reduce the presence of on-site university employees by as much as 75 percent while maintaining functions critical to the UAB mission. It is important to remember that UAB Hospital never closes and continues to prepare to safely isolate and care for COVID-19 patients.</p><p>

At this time, a limited business model is in the best interests of the health and safety of our students, faculty and staff, and is an important community service to minimize COVID-19 spread. <strong>During this time, it is vital that everyone in every group practices aggressive and meaningful <a href="/coronavirus/social-distancing">social distancing, as well as proper hygiene</a> to avoid contracting or spreading COVID-19.</strong> If you experience symptoms, call before you go to the doctor. Please call <a href="https://www.uab.edu/humanresources/home/employeehealth">Employee Health</a> or call <a href="https://www.uabmedicine.org/4you">UAB Medicine 4YOU</a> at 205-934-9999.</p>
 
<h4>
 How will limited business operations work?   
</h4><p>
Employees are assigned to the appropriate group by their unit leadership/supervisor and should follow supervisor instructions. </p><p>
<strong>Workgroup A, Group 1 will report to work as normal; Workgroup A, Group 2 will stay home and continue to work; and Workgroup A, Group 3 will not work. Supervisors determine which positions and employees are suitable for telecommuting, not the individual employees themselves.</strong>
 
</p><ul>
<li><strong>Workgroup A, Group 1</strong> will report to work as normal <strong>(unless you are sick or have been in immediate contact with a person known to have COVID-19 — see <a href="/coronavirus/info-for-you/faculty/#employee-health-faqs">employee coronavirus health resources</a>).</strong></li><ul>
<li>Maintain <a href="/coronavirus/social-distancing">social distance and good hygiene</a>. Utilize phone calls and virtual meetings as much as possible (even for small groups). Any gatherings of more than 25 people will require approval from a dean, vice president or AVP.</li>
<li>Supervisors should make every effort to <strong>not include student-employees in Workgroup A, Group 1 for on-campus work</strong>. If a supervisor thinks a student’s role is essential, approval must be granted by HR before a student is assigned to Workgroup A, Group 1.</li></ul>
<li><strong>Workgroup A, Group 2</strong> will stay home and continue to work (as soon as possible but in effect no later than 5 p.m. Monday, March 16). If you do not need to return to campus, don’t. Also, <strong>do not return to campus if you are sick. See <a href="/coronavirus/info-for-you/faculty/#employee-health-faqs">employee coronavirus health resources</a> for guidance if you think you may have symptoms.</strong></li><ul>
<li>If needed, Monday, March 16, can be used to prepare to effectively work from home. If you need to go to campus to get essential items (e.g., laptop or desktop computer, supplies) to make working from home possible, coordinate with your supervisor to stagger coming to campus with others to limit contact with others.</li>
<li>Carefully read the <a href="https://www.uab.edu/news/images/2018/images/covid19/GUIDELINES_FOR_TEMPORARY_TELECOMMUTING.pdf">UAB Temporary Telecommuting Guidance</a>, sign the <a href="https://powerforms.docusign.net/58ce1541-732a-4a7e-90a2-fe19420c3a6e?env=na3-eu1&amp;acct=097de7a9-05d2-49f4-9572-521df6d32f4a">Temporary Telecommuting Agreement</a> and send to your supervisor (scan or digital photo is OK), then forward to your HR representative.</li><br>
</ul><ul>
    
    
<strong>The temporary telecommuting agreement and guidelines</strong> were established as part of UAB’s efforts to support business continuity across campus. They are temporary and should not be confused with UAB’s standard telecommuting agreement and guidelines. Highlights of the agreement include:
<ul>
<li>Supervisors determine which positions and employees are suitable for telecommuting, not the individual employees themselves.</li>
<li>The temporary telecommuting agreement can be modified or terminated at any time, especially if operational needs warrant the change. </li>
<li>Employees should understand obligations regarding securing UAB records and transmitting information (e.g., sensitive information related to student records, patient privacy, intellectual property, etc.).</li>
<li>Employees are responsible for establishing an appropriate work environment, meeting productivity and service goals required by management, keeping and reporting time worked, and communicating in the appropriate manner and frequency.</li><br>
</ul></ul>
    <ul>
        
<li><strong>Rather than forwarding your work phone to your cellphone, please change your outgoing voicemail message on your work phone to instruct callers to call your cellphone directly. This will alleviate capacity constraints we would face if too many work phones are forwarded.</strong> </li>
<li>Utilize available resources to set up remote working capabilities.</li><ul>

 The fast-moving and dynamic nature of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak has led to many uncertainties and questions. This is not unique to UAB, universities or health systems. We are glad the <a href="http://uasystem.edu/updated-interim-emergency-policy-for-ua-uab-and-uah/">University of Alabama System took decisive action as part of a proactive planning process</a> to promote health and safety on our campus.
</p><p>


As we work to operationalize the change, we may not have all the answers immediately. But a very dedicated team is committed to reducing uncertainties as much and as quickly as possible. <strong>Ultimately, we want to minimize disruption to the lives of our campus community while keeping health and safety our top priority.</strong></p><p>

 
A great deal of planning has taken place, and many questions have been answered. Please take the time to review the information that is available – including resources, communications and frequently asked questions – at <a href="http://www.uab.edu/coronavirus">www.uab.edu/coronavirus</a>.

<p>
As you know, we are shifting to online and alternative learning after spring break. Additional preparations are underway as we monitor the outbreak. <strong>Business operations are being maintained at this time (i.e., faculty and staff are asked to report to work), but we may need to make additional adjustments in the interest of health and safety.</strong> At this time, student workers/employees/interns who remain on campus and want to continue working may be able to maintain their normal work schedule. Managers are asked to be understanding of student-employees’ circumstances. Ultimately, circumstances will vary, and student-employees should speak with their supervisor/coordinating instructor who can consult leadership on a case-by-case basis as necessary.
</p><p>
In the event normal business operations are altered, Human Resources is working with leaders across campus to explore – for example – job functions that can take place in a remote setting off campus to promote social distancing.
 </p><p>

In the meantime, units on campus are encouraged to test remote working capabilities on a limited basis with some faculty and staff working from home to help identify challenges and opportunities, should a more comprehensive limited business plan be implemented. <a href="https://www.uab.edu/humanresources/home/images/Forms/Telecommuting-Agreement_5-27-16.pdf">UAB Telecommuting Agreement</a>
 </p><p>

Logistical changes – including limiting access to some facilities and closing some university functions – are being considered and will be communicated as soon as details are clear. While student access will be limited, all academic buildings will remain open to faculty and staff.

   Based on recent developments, discussions with leadership on University of Alabama System campuses and with other institutions, and advice of the University of Alabama System Task Force, <a href="http://uasystem.edu/news/2020/02/ua-system-covid-19-updates/" target="_blank">the UA System is making <strong>immediate preparations</strong> to transition to on-line or alternate instruction for all academic courses</a> to protect the health and safety of our communities. This policy will be re-evaluated on or before <strong>Monday, April 6, 2020.</strong></p>
<p>Each campus will keep faculty, staff and students updated electronically on individualized plans, timelines and specific changes as soon as possible. </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>UAB is scheduled for Spring Break the week of March 16-20.</strong><strong></strong> <strong>UAB’s Spring Break will be extended through at least March 24.</strong> Each campus will notify students, faculty and staff when the semester will resume. </li>

<li>Following Spring Break, UAB students should <strong>not</strong> return to campus and will continue their course work via distance learning subject to the following limited exceptions: </li><ul>
    <li>international or other students who do not have alternative accommodations; </li>
<li>students from areas without high-speed internet or other means of receiving remote instruction; </li>
<li>students with exceptional hardships, or academic, employment, clinical or research requirements that should be reviewed by the respective campuses on a case-by-case basis.  </li></ul>
    <li><strong>Arrangements will be made by the campuses to ensure any students remaining on campus have access to essential services (including Student Health Services/Counseling Services). Residence Hall and dining facilities will be open for students who remain on campus.</strong></li>
    
    <li>
    The UA System’s restriction on ALL non-essential international and domestic travel remains in place.  All non-essential University meetings, gatherings and events are cancelled. Faculty, staff and students abroad and in international affiliated programs sponsored by third parties should contact their program administrators for information and further guidance.
</li><li>These policies will be updated as circumstances require. </li>

   <strong> This policy applies only to academic classes. At this time, regular business operations will continue until further notice. Additional guidance will be forthcoming. Until further notice, faculty and staff should report to work.</strong>

    Update to the UA System’s Interim Emergency Policy – Information Regarding Spring Break
</h3>
 <p>
     As are colleges and universities throughout North America, the University of Alabama System is taking precautionary measures regarding the health and safety of our students, faculty and staff.
     
</p> <p>

In preparation for the upcoming spring break March 16-20 at UA and UAB, with UAH’s break the following week (March 23-27), our <strong>current plans call for maintaining normal campus operations</strong>. Our guidance is based on the best information available to us at this time from local, state and federal agencies and health care professionals.</p> <p>

 
As you consider plans for spring break, please keep these important points in mind to protect yourself and our community from the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak.</p> <p>

 
</p><ol>
<li>Our goal is to provide continuity and consistency for our students. If the situations in our communities change, we will transition to alternative modes of instruction (such as on-line classes) to protect the health and safety of System campuses. While current plans are to maintain regular schedules, it is possible that System campuses could move to alternative modes of instruction at some point this semester depending on the state of COVID-19 in Alabama. <strong>IF</strong> it becomes necessary to cancel in-person classes, plan ahead to have what you need. When you leave for spring break, take essential belongings with you (e.g., class materials, textbooks, medications, electronics, valuables, etc.), in the event a transition to alternative modes of instruction becomes necessary.</li> <br>
<li>If you live on campus, are uncomfortable traveling, and <strong>prefer to stay</strong> on campus during spring break, we will provide you with accommodations. It is important that you notify us of your plans if you decide to remain on campus. At UAB, email <span id="cloak8a6893d696ef8fe135ca2d5ebf17ea46">This email address is being protected from spambots.

     The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak is evolving quickly, and the outbreak has required proactive leadership from the University of Alabama System to <a href="http://click.reach.uab.edu/?qs=da21b992f59147e94e6ad885f06605dc112895330f05297b8c0cd0ed4422982b0e8b76f7853cc04bf37644ea6c56dec1b348feeeacb6d463">restrict international travel</a>.

</p><p>

There are some decisions — based on the current status of the outbreak and recent guidance from the UA System — that UAB leadership should make based on specific potential risks and circumstances. Decisions must be made regarding university-sponsored domestic travel, events and visitors to campus.
</p><p>
<strong>Any faculty or staff member sponsoring, organizing or otherwise leading university-sponsored or university-hosted travel, events or visitors should alert your leadership as soon as possible. That leader will determine if the activity is essential or non-essential, and if it poses a risk to the health and safety of the campus community:</strong>
</p><ul>
<li><strong>Non-essential Domestic Travel (<a href="http://click.reach.uab.edu/?qs=da21b992f59147e954cc5234614ba63d775a8b328d9b833e5a4423f960afa9318a917c8dc24f66fb3bfaf088df9815721b210aaa22875d27">UA System Domestic Travel Advisory</a>):</strong> Non-essential domestic travel is discouraged at this time. A decision must be made as to whether the university-sponsored domestic travel is essential or non-essential.</li>
<li><strong>Events/Visitor(s) to Campus:</strong> A decision must be made as to whether the event or visitor on campus (e.g., speakers, conferences, orientations, seminars, performances, competition) carries potential risks and whether the event/visit can take place.<p></p></li>
</ul>
Leaders responsible to make decisions in each area include:
<ul>
<li>Deans will review activities in schools and colleges</li>
<li>VPs and/or AVPs will review activities for administrative units (each VP will determine the appropriate starting point for his or her unit)</li>
<li>Athletic administrators will review activities in Athletics</li>
</ul>
<p>Decisions should be based on the relative risk of the travel or visitor(s), understanding that our top priority as an institution is the health and safety of our campus community. If the dean, AVP or athletic administrator is the event sponsor, the determination for that event should be made by his or her supervisor so the decision is not made by someone personally invested in the organization of the event.
</p><p>
Questions to ask when considering the necessity of the travel or visitor(s) include:
</p><ul>
<li>Can you explain why the travel/visitor(s) is essential?</li>
<li>Can the travel/visitor(s) be postponed?</li>
<li>Can the purpose of the travel/visitor(s) be accomplished in another way (e.g., virtually)?</li>
<li>Does the size of the event/number of attendees create too much risk?</li>
<li>Do the attendees/visitor(s) create too much risk (e.g., coming from a domestic or international location with significant COVID-19 spread)?</li>
</ul>
<p>UA System and UAB leaders will continue to monitor the situation closely and provide additional or revised guidance as the situation evolves. Thank you for your attention to this important matter.<br><br>

   The University of Alabama System continues to closely monitor the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak.  Today System officials issued <a href="http://uasystem.edu/update-to-ua-systems-covid-19-interim-emergency-policy-statement/">guidance advising against any non-essential domestic travel</a> at this time, particularly to large conferences with attendees from multiple states or locations that have <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/what-us-states-have-declared-state-emergency-amid-coronavirus-outbreak-1491299">declared a state of emergency</a> due to the virus.  
</p>
<p> 
Faculty, staff and students on UA System campuses are encouraged to use good judgment when making travel decisions and work with campus administration to evaluate alternative methods of remote participation such as live-streaming of conference sessions and meetings.
 </p>
<p>
The UA System advisory also states: “Students, faculty and staff who have concerns about being exposed to the virus while traveling should not be required to travel.  Likewise, any student, faculty or staff member who elects not to attend a previously scheduled event due to those concerns should not be disciplined.”  <a href="http://uasystem.edu/update-to-ua-systems-covid-19-interim-emergency-policy-statement/">Read the full advisory here.</a>

                <div class="uk-margin"><h3>Email from President Ray L. Watts and Health System CEO Will Ferniany: Coronavirus Preparedness Updates and Resources as of March 4, 2020</h3>
<p><em> *NOTE: The following email was sent March 4, 2020 at 3:30 p.m. as part of a collaborative communications effort led by the University of Alabama System in the interest of health and safety on the three System campuses. Last week Chancellor Finis St. John appointed a COVID-19 Communications and Policy Task Force to address the 2019 Corona virus. The task force, comprised of UA System medical researchers, faculty and staff, is continuously monitoring public health risks posed by the outbreak. Subsequently, a comprehensive <a href="https://www.uab.edu/news/images/2018/images/covid19/UA_System_COVID-19_Policy.pdf">University of Alabama System Interim Emergency Policy</a> was developed regarding the 2019 Coronavirus. The policy will be updated as circumstances warrant.</em></p>
<p>UAB Community,</p>
<p><strong>Today you received an email about <a href="http://uasystem.edu/news/2020/02/ua-system-covid-19-updates/">new travel restrictions</a>, including the CANCELATION of all university-sponsored international travel in March. Travel outside the United States after March is ON HOLD and will be addressed as soon as possible. Details can be found on the UAB Updates tab of<a href="http://www.uab.edu/coronavirus"> www.uab.edu/coronavirus</a>,</strong> an online resource that provides important information, tips and resources as we safeguard our community and prepare for the likely appearance of novel coronavirus (COVID-19) in Alabama. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">If you have not read that communication, please do so in the interest of your health and safety, and that of our community.</span></p>
<p>While there are no known cases of COVID-19 in Alabama at the time of this communication, there are confirmed cases in Florida and Georgia, and it could be seen in Alabama soon. COVID-19 appears to cause mild illness in the majority of those infected but can be fatal. <strong>Learn more at <a href="http://www.uab.edu/coronavirus">www.uab.edu/coronavirus</a>.</strong></p>
<p>The CDC predicts possible significant disruptions to daily life in the United States. While we cannot predict whether our community will be affected in a small or big way,<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> we want to be prepared for even extreme outcomes. </span></p>
<p><strong>UAB officials are and have been very active in monitoring the quickly evolving outbreak with infectious disease and public health experts and taking aggressive steps to prepare for possible scenarios. </strong>University and Health System emergency management professionals have convened broad and targeted groups to review the plans to address an infectious disease outbreak and apply it to the specific COVID-19 threat.</p>
<p>Units across campus have been taking steps to prepare for eventualities. For example:</p>
<ul>
	<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">First and foremost, medical providers at the University and Health System are trained to properly care for patients with infectious diseases and have plans in place to safely care for COVID-19 patients.</span></li>
	<li><strong>UAB launched <a href="http://www.uab.edu/coronavirus">www.uab.edu/coronavirus</a> as a resource to communicate news and updates, as well as tips to stay healthy and prepare. Information will be maintained there</strong>.</li>
	<li>UAB Facilities is increasing the frequency of cleaning and disinfecting areas like bathrooms, entryways, door handles, railings and elevator buttons.</li>
	<li>From Campus Housing and Dining to Environmental Health and Safety, to Hospital Supply Chain, procurement officials have assessed what supplies are needed now and what supplies would be needed if disruptions become extreme.</li>
	<li>Plans to manage and conserve supplies (e.g., plans to prioritize, limit and/or reuse certain supplies to avoid a shortage if the duration of disruptions become significant) are being reviewed and updated based on possible COVID-19 scenarios.</li>
	<li><strong>Offices that support international travel for students, faculty and staff are supporting unexpected changes in travel plans and programs to minimize disruptions as much as possible while maintaining health and safety.</strong></li>
	<li>Health care professionals in Student and Employee Health have enacted protocols to monitor, guide and report the status of those returning from international destinations in partnership with the Alabama Department of Public Health.</li>
	<li><strong>Information Technology, the Office of the Provost, and school and college deans are taking steps to protect our ability to maintain our academic mission while employing social distancing techniques or quarantine measures. This planning includes addressing the technical and logistical infrastructure that would allow for classes to continue if they eventually need to move online in Canvas.</strong></li>
	<li>Planning and preparations are also taking place to protect our vital research mission. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Research Administration leadership is updating business continuity plans based on COVID-19 and will continue to monitor and prepare to protect research activities as much as possible if disruptions occur</span>.</li>
	<li>Human Resources is consulting with leadership to provide guidance regarding the possible future need for work-from-home scenarios.</li>
	<li><strong>Areas have been identified where facilities can be repurposed to safely manage patient flow should an influx of COVID-19 patients take place.</strong></li>
	<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">We are encouraging patients with concerning symptoms to call their health care provider before going to the doctor,</span> and our Emergency Department is screening incoming patients just outside the entrance to the Emergency Department to decrease possible exposure to others.</li>
</ul>
<p>These are just a few examples of steps being taken. <strong>Units across campus will continue to update their specific plans to protect each other and our community and continue to deliver essential services. </strong>Disruptions — small or large — may be inevitable; but our goal is to minimize the effect on you — our students, faculty and staff — as well as the education, research, innovation and economic development, patient care, and community service pillars of our mission.</p>
<p><strong>Please continue to look to your emails and <a href="http://www.uab.edu/coronavirus">www.uab.edu/coronavirus</a> for important updates.</strong> At UAB, we are fortunate to have many experts in epidemiology and the prevention and treatment of infectious diseases to guide us. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Know that our top priority will remain the continued health and safety of our UAB community.</span></p>
<p><strong> Please continue to be vigilant,<a href="https://www.ready.gov/pandemic"> plan ahead </a>and protect against spreading viral illness:</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Wash hands frequently</strong> and avoid touching your face with unwashed hands.</li>
	<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Avoid sick people, avoid people if you are sick, and do not travel if you are sick</span>.</li>
	<li>Clean and disinfect surfaces and cover your cough or sneeze with a sleeve or tissue.</li>
	<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Protect against the flu by getting the <strong>flu vaccine</strong></span>. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">The flu vaccine does not protect against COVID-19,</span> but the flu is still circulating in the community at this time.</li>
	<li>The CDC does not recommend the general public buy or wear masks in the United States.</li>
	<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>If you have symptoms, call your health care provider BEFORE</strong></span> going to the doctor:
		<ul>
			<li>Students should call UAB Health Services at 205-934-3580.</li>
		</ul>
		<ul>
			<li>UAB employees should call UAB Employee Health at 205-934-3675 from 6:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. Monday through Friday. After hours and on weekends, call the UAB Call Center at 205-934-3411 and ask them to page the needlestick/exposure nurse on call.</li>

<h3>NEW Coronavirus (COVID-19) Travel Restrictions and Updates</h3>
<p><strong> Effective immediately, UAB is canceling all university-sponsored international travel that is scheduled to depart in the month of March.</strong> Faculty, staff and students <strong>MAY NOT TRAVEL</strong> anywhere outside the United States for university business or academic purposes (“university-sponsored travel”), including but not limited to study abroad or other international academic work, research or grant activity, internships, conferences or presentations, teaching or training, performances, recruiting, or athletic competitions.</p>
<p>Additionally, university-sponsored travel outside of the United States that is <strong>scheduled to depart after the month of March is suspended effective immediately.</strong> Regarding future university-sponsored travel outside of the United States beyond March, this is a complex decision that is based on new and evolving information. Decisions on those future programs are <strong>ON HOLD</strong> and will be addressed as soon as possible. <strong>Please read the full <a href="http://uasystem.edu/interim-emergency-policy-statement-regarding-the-2019-coronavirus/">updated interim policy</a></strong> issued by the <a href="http://uasystem.edu/news/2020/02/ua-system-covid-19-updates/">University of Alabama System.</a></p>
<p>Due to the expanding global coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak, the significant risk of exposure during international travel, and guidance from experts in public health and infectious disease, <strong>we expect full cooperation and compliance with this Updated Interim Policy</strong> to maintain a safe and healthy environment for everyone. Faculty, staff, students, and visiting students and scholars who fail to comply with this policy may be subject to disciplinary action.</p>
<p><strong>We recognize the significance of these measures to members of our campus community and are committed to providing support.

<p>We understand that many members of our community may have upcoming spring break travel, conferences or summer study abroad plans that this policy may affect. We further understand that the longer the travel restrictions remain in place, more questions will arise related to future plans for international travel. To assess the impact of the virus on faculty, staff and students, a dedicated team composed of members from throughout the UA System, including our clinical and infection prevention experts, is monitoring the outbreak and utilizing guidance from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the World Health Organization, and international governments and health agencies. <strong>Administrators at each campus are continuously evaluating and receiving advice on potential impacts and will provide future information and guidance.</strong></p>
<p>While there are no known cases of COVID-19 in Alabama at the time of this communication, there are confirmed cases in Florida and Georgia, and it could be seen in Alabama soon.</p>
<p><strong>Please continue to be vigilant, <a href="https://www.ready.gov/pandemic">plan ahead</a> and protect against spreading viral illness:</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cViNneQbPyA&amp;feature=emb_title">Wash hands frequently</a>, and avoid touching your face with unwashed hands.</li>
	<li>Avoid sick people, avoid people if you are sick, and do not travel if you are sick.</li>
	<li>Clean and disinfect surfaces, and cover your cough or sneeze with a sleeve or tissue.</li>
	<li>Protect against the flu by getting the flu vaccine. The flu vaccine does not protect against COVID-19, but the flu poses an active health threat in Alabama at this time.</li>
	<li><strong>If you have <a href="https://www.uab.edu/news/images/2018/images/covid19/Coronavirus-Symptoms-graphic.jpg">symptoms</a>, call your health care provider BEFORE going to the doctor:</strong>
		<ul>
			<li>Students should call UAB Student Health Services at 205-934-3580.</li>
			<li>UAB employees should call UAB Employee Health at 205-934-3675 from 6:30 a.m.-5 p.m. Monday-Friday. After hours and on weekends, call the UAB Call Center at 205-934-3411 and ask them to page the needlestick/exposure nurse on-call.</li>
