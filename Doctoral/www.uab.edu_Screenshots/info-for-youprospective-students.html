    <div class="uk-accordion-content">

        
        
        
                <div class="uk-margin"><p>
    UAB students,</p> 

<p>We’re looking forward to <a href="https://www.uab.edu/coronavirus/reentry/uab-united">uniting on campus again</a>. University and System leadership are in constant contact with infectious disease and public health experts as we plan for a safe return to campus. We will provide regular updates and greater detail about plans leading up to the <a href="https://www.uab.edu/coronavirus/reentry/student-re-entry">fall semester</a>. </p>
<p>
To stay informed, please read all emails from UAB, including Greenmail every Wednesday. You can also visit <a href="http://www.uab.edu/coronavirus">uab.edu/coronavirus</a> and <a href="http://www.uab.edu/reentry">uab.edu/reentry</a>, both of which have student-specific sections. </p>
<p>
Key COVID-19 safety strategies for the fall (detailed plans will be communicated):</p>
<ul>
<li>Students, faculty and staff will complete a COVID-19 safety training prior to reentry</li>
<li>Masks/face coverings and social distancing will be required and enforced </li>
<li>COVID-19 testing will be used strategically, informed by infectious disease experts </li>
<li>Use of UAB-developed symptom monitoring “health check” and exposure notification technology </li>
<li>Educational and instructional safety signage posted throughout campus</li>
<li>Extensive cleaning and disinfecting practices in place</li>
<li>Residence halls and other buildings will take special precautions </li>
<li>We will not return to in-person fall semester instruction after Thanksgiving Break; after the Thanksgiving Break there will be one week of remote/alternate instruction classes, and final exams will be taken remotely the following week (we plan to resume in-person classes for the spring semester in January 2021)</li>
<li>In the interest of safety, <a href="https://www.uab.edu/commencement/ceremony/summer">summer commencement</a> will be held virtually (graduates who wish to walk in a future in-person ceremony will have the opportunity to do so)</li>
<li>Guidance, health tips and updates will be communicated regularly</li>
</ul>
<p>
In addition, our hybrid instruction model will safely manage class sizes starting in the fall semester to promote social distancing. In most classes, students will rotate days in and out of the classroom with a combination of in-person and remote learning. Faculty (who will address class format in their syllabi) will provide in-person instruction to roughly 30-50 percent of students registered in a class while a camera system feeds real-time video to the remainder of the class remotely. The recording will also be available in Canvas for later viewing. Equipment has been secured to support the hybrid model and will be installed in time for the fall semester. </p>
<p>
Again, please check your email regularly and read Greenmail every Wednesday for important updates. If you have family members who would also like <a href="https://uab.tfaforms.net/217785">to receive Greenmail, sign up here</a>. 

</p>
<p>
In the meantime, please continue to be an example in our community by following important <a href="https://www.uab.edu/coronavirus/social-distancing">COVID-19 safety guidelines</a>. </p>

    <div class="uk-accordion-content">

        
        
        
                <div class="uk-margin"><p>
    Despite our nation's efforts to slowly reopen our cities and economies, COVID-19 continues to be a very real and serious threat to the health and safety of our community and will continue to be into the fall semester as well. As a result, it is vital for us to implement strict protocols and practices within the residence halls to continue to keep you and your families as safe as possible.</p>
<p>Please carefully review the changes outlined below. Additional information will be sent on a regular basis throughout the rest of the summer. </p>
<h3>
  IMPORTANT STUDENT HOUSING UPDATES FOR FALL 2020  
</h3>
<ul>
<li>All residence hall rooms, lobbies, lounges, and laundry rooms will be thoroughly cleaned, disinfected, and sanitized prior to opening for fall. Common area spaces (lobbies, lounges, laundry rooms, elevators) will be cleaned more frequently throughout the day during the year.</li>
<li>Residents will be required to complete an online COVID safety precaution training module and a contract addendum prior to arriving on campus to move in.</li>
<li>We anticipate that all residents – symptomatic or not – will be asked to be tested for COVID-19 before moving into the residence halls. More information will be provided as details and guidance are available.</li>
<li>Green Hall (our newest residence hall currently under construction) will not be completely open for operation until late Fall 2020; some students will have an opportunity to delay moving on campus until it is complete. If you would like to consider this option, please notify us at <span id="cloak405665d100ddc4a0feb49f7f7fa8cf8d">This email address is being protected from spambots.

		</script>.</li>
    <li>Rast and Blount Halls have private bedrooms and will be fully occupied this fall. Because the common areas will be used by up to four people, residents in these halls will be required to clean and disinfect their apartments weekly.</li>
<li>Students who require any special accommodations must register with Disability Student Services to provide the required documentation for housing accommodation requests. If you have not already started this process, we encourage you to do so as soon as possible. For more information, go to <a href="http://www.uab.edu/dss">www.uab.edu/dss</a>.</li>
<li>Residents will only be allowed limited personal belongings in the halls this fall - more details will follow.</li>
<li>VISITORS WILL NOT BE ALLOWED IN ANY UAB RESIDENCE HALL FOR THE ENTIRE FALL SEMESTER.</li>
<li>In-hall gatherings will be very limited and prohibited for groups larger than ten (10) people.</li>
<li>Lounges and lobbies will be restricted to ten (10) people or less, and 6 feet of separation between individuals must be maintained.</li>
<li>Face masks will be required in common areas and wearing them will be enforced.</li>
<li>No more than two residents on an elevator at a time – riders will face opposite walls with face masks in place.</li>
<li>Residents must notify Student Health should they experience any symptoms related to COVID-19.</li>
<li>Residents must self-isolate if they have COVID-related symptoms. Apartments designated for quarantine and isolation will be made available; residents will be required to temporarily relocate to those spaces until symptoms subside and Student Health clears them to return to their assigned residence hall.</li>
<li>UAB plans to make exposure notification technology available to anonymously alert individuals of possible exposure to someone who has tested positive for COVID-19.  </li>
<li>Students will be required to complete a web-based health check assessment, and students may be asked to participate in voluntary, sentinel COVID-19 testing during the semester.</li>
</ul>

<h3>
    Information for Returning Residents
</h3>
<p>
    Students who wish to cancel their fall application may do so and will receive a full refund of all Fall 2020 housing application fees paid to date if we receive your request on or before July 1. A separate email will be sent with instructions upon your request. If you decide to cancel for the fall semester, we encourage you to consider returning to housing in the spring, as we hope to progress toward returning to more normal operation within Student Housing.

<p>Our <a href="http://www.uab.edu/reentry">gradual re-entry to campus</a> continues and is going well, as is our planning with the University of Alabama System for a safe return this fall with a hybrid model – a course delivery system which, because of social distancing precautions, requires a combination of both in-person instruction and remote instruction. To promote the health and safety of the campus community, adjustments have been made to the fall semester schedule:</p>
 
<ul>
<li>Fall semester hybrid classes will start Monday, Aug. 24, 2020.</li>
<li>Fall semester hybrid classes will end Friday, Nov. 20, for the Thanksgiving break.</li>
<li>Students will not return to campus after Thanksgiving break. </li>
<li>Exceptions can be granted for students based on work, research or clinical responsibilities, and accommodations can be requested for international students or others who do not have alternate living arrangements.  </li>
<li>Classes during the week of Nov. 30-Dec. 4, as well as final exams during the week of Dec. 7-11, will be conducted remotely.<br>
<em>Coursework engagement during these weeks is necessary to accommodate <a href="https://sacscoc.org/accrediting-standards/">SACSCOC accrediting standard</a> requirements for credit granted for coursework. </em></li>
</ul>

<p>Additional information for our phased re-entry to campus (including details about on-campus housing, classroom protocols, personal protective equipment, and COVID-19 training and testing) continue to be worked out and will be communicated in the coming days and weeks. UAB’s e-newsletters are your source of official information. To stay informed of the latest news and updates, students are encouraged read Greenmail each Wednesday, and faculty and staff are encouraged to read eReporter each Tuesday and Friday.

<p>In partnership with the University of Alabama System and with the support of the Board of Trustees, we are committed to making our campus among the safest in America as you return at the right time and under the right conditions. On-campus classes remain canceled for the summer, but our goal is to resume in-person classes in the fall. </p>

<p>Between now and then, we plan to phase in a <a href="https://www.uab.edu/coronavirus/reentry">gradual re-entry to campus</a>, taking into account the dynamic and evolving circumstances. In this plan, some groups will return to campus before others. At this time, some students in clinical and research roles are beginning to return to campus (mostly postdoctoral and graduate/pre-doctoral students with limited exceptions for undergraduates) with prior approval, training and a health check. </p>

<p>Task forces are developing comprehensive plans for a safe fall semester re-entry, including training and testing, enter/exit control, personal protective equipment, social distancing, and hygiene. We will have protocols for classrooms, dining, residence halls, recreation, health and counseling services, and other areas critical to a safe return. To promote classroom safety, we are exploring a variety of learning models that we will review with student and faculty leaders to identify the best solution for UAB.</p>

<p>Current plans are for our return to be supported by UAB’s Safe Together Now platform, which includes a symptom and exposure tracking COVID-19 assessment tool, as well as an anonymous, <a href="https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/security/laws-regulations/index.html">HIPAA-privacy compliant</a> contact tracer in partnership with Apple, Google and the Alabama Department of Public Health. </p>

<p>Many experts are involved in our planning. Earlier this month, we captured some other ways UAB experts are making a difference in our community and beyond. UAB students, faculty and staff have demonstrated a great fighting spirit of resilience and innovation in these times. </p>

<p>Thank you for all you have done and continue to do. </p>

<p>Ever Faithful. Ever Loyal.</p>

                <div class="uk-margin"><p>
    To say these are unprecedented times is an understatement. The challenges posed by the novel coronavirus COVID-19 are tremendous, and we realize you have had to face a lot of uncertainty and change in a short amount of time.</p>

<p>
The decision to move to virtual instruction was made with your health and well-being in mind. The goal of these changes is to minimize the need to gather in large groups and spend prolonged time in proximity with each other in spaces. As part of our Academic Continuity Plan, we are adding a supplemental plan to allow a student to elect pass/fail grading in spring semester courses, on a course-by-course basis. <a href="/coronavirus/images/documents/grading-attachment-for-students.pdf" target="_blank">The details are included here</a>. Please read over this so you are prepared to speak with your professors about any of these changes.
</p>

<p>
Even though we will be working at a distance, I am personally reminded of just how connected we are to one another. You each have had to adapt quickly and change behaviors to keep our community safe. I am proud to be a Blazer right alongside you, and we will continue to work together each step of the way. 
</p>

<p>
Our dedicated faculty have been working around the clock to respond to the challenges posed by COVID-19. Our instructors have developed creative ways to adapt their materials to our new environment. Be sure to watch for their updates in your inbox. I am especially grateful to our eLearning and Center for Teaching and Learning staffs who have made resources available to instructors and students. I invite you all to visit uab.edu/coronavirus and peruse the Student section to become familiar with resources available to help you prepare for online learning.
</p>

<p>
This new reality is still fluid and uncertain. It is normal to experience feelings of stress and frustration, but I want you to know that we are here for you and that we are in this together. I encourage you to check out the Student resources, specifically those for your mental health and well-being, at uab.edu/coronavirus. UAB Blazers are resilient, and we will overcome each hurdle together.
</p>

<p>
We are excited about welcoming you back to classes tomorrow. Your learning and progress move us forward toward a bright and exciting future.

    <h3 class="uk-accordion-title"><span>Office of the Provost cancels study abroad programs through Aug. 15</span> Wednesday, March 18 at 12 p.m.</h3>

    <div class="uk-accordion-content">

        
        
        
                <div class="uk-margin"><p>
    UAB continues to monitor the worldwide novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic while keeping your impending study abroad in mind. The health and safety of our students is our top priority when it comes to our education abroad programs; therefore, the university has issued the following decision:  
</p><p>
Effective immediately, the university is <strong>suspending all UAB Education Abroad programs through August 15 as a result of the <a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/traveladvisories/ea/travel-advisory-alert-global-level-3-health-advisory-issue.html" target="_blank">U.S. Department of State Global Level 3 Health Advisory-Reconsider Travel</a>.</strong> 
 </p><p>
It is for this reason that study abroad taking place in summer 2020 is cancelled.  
 </p>
<h4>
    For students on faculty-led programs
</h4><p>
The Office of Education Abroad will encourage faculty leaders to redevelop their courses to be facilitated at UAB.  Please watch for further communication from your faculty member.  If you individually purchased airfare, refund considerations will be collected by the Office of Education Abroad with proof that the air carrier will not issue a refund or flight credit due to the worldwide pandemic.
 </p>
<h4>
    For students on summer affiliate programs

</h4><p>
The Office of Education Abroad encourages students to work with their academic advisors to identify alternative courses to ensure their academic progress.
 </p><h4>
Financials Processes

</h4><p>
UAB Education Abroad will be working to refund any fees paid directly to our office, including the admin fee and faculty led program fees, via original payment. This may take a little time with UAB limited business operations but we will notify you when this has occurred.  <strong>If you applied for summer 2020 scholarships, we encourage you to consider applying for a future term, as your effort this summer will not go unnoticed.</strong>
 </p><p>
We are saddened by the worldwide effects of the pandemic, including the impact on your study abroad plans. However, we hope you understand that your health is our highest priority and that this decision has not been taken lightly. We understand that this information may be overwhelming, but please know that the university stands ready to assist students with these resources. 
 </p><p>
We sincerely hope that you’ll consider studying abroad in the future — our team stands ready to assist you with deferring your plans.

                <div class="uk-margin"><p>Dear UAB Residential Student,
    
</p><p>
Due to the rapid escalation of the COVID-19 pandemic, <strong>UAB needs to minimize the volume of people on campus as quickly as possible</strong> to protect the health and safety of students, faculty and staff, and our community.
    
</p>
 <p>
<strong>We need your help during this difficult and unprecedented time.</strong> Online classes will begin on Wednesday, March 25, after an extended spring break.

		</script> for guidance and assistance. We will follow up with you as soon as possible.</li>
<li>We have consulted at length with COVID-19 experts. For safety reasons, only students who do not have a place to go (e.g., students with an exceptional hardship or international students) can be allowed to stay in a residence hall. </li>
<li><strong>Take any essential belongings and school-related resources you will need with you.</strong> </li>
</ul>
    
<p>
I realize this is a very difficult situation. It was our desire to minimize disruptions by accommodating students who preferred to stay on campus during spring break. However, it has become clear that the COVID-19 pandemic — now a state and national emergency — requires us to drastically reduce the number of people on campus for safety reasons. 

</p><p>
<strong>The Student Affairs team is here to support you in this transition and will do what we can, but we must ask for your cooperation during this public health crisis.
</strong>
    
</p><p>
<em><strong>A note for student workers/employees:</strong> UAB will be moving to limited business operations for university employees in <a href="https://www.uab.edu/humanresources/home/wfgroups" target="_blank">Workgroup A</a> no later than 5 p.m. Monday, March 16, that will only allow for essential employees to come to campus, with others working from home or not working. On-campus student employment will be suspended with very few exceptions for a period of at least 14 days. During this two-week period, student employees/workers will be paid. In the event of a prolonged disruption, leadership will work with all sources (federal, state, etc.) in an effort to continue financial support of our employees. Further, UAB Leadership is exploring opportunities — including possible use of the Benevolent Fund — to financially help employees who encounter hardships due to the suspension of work IF limited business last longer than two weeks.
</em>    
</p><p>
We are committed to making this transition as smooth as possible. For more COVID-19 updates and information, please check your emails regularly and access the student information pages under "Info for You" at <a href="/coronavirus/">uab.edu/coronavirus</a>.</div>

<p>UAB is extending spring break through at least March 24 and will use alternative means of instruction with two goals in mind — protect your health and promote your academic progress. During this time, we will work to ensure all needed resources are available to you, keep you updated on any changes in plans or timelines and answer your questions as best and quickly as possible.</p>

<p>Circumstances change quickly, so we encourage you to read the emails we send promptly and check this website for answers to frequently asked questions.</p>

<p>For the health and safety of our residents, all overnight visitation in the residence halls is immediately suspended until further notice with the exception of guests approved by 5 p.m. March 13.</p>

<h3>All Students</h3>

<p>Also note Hill Student Center, inclusive of dining options, will close at 7 p.m. Sunday, March 15, and Campus Recreation will close operations at 9 p.m. Monday, March 16 until further notice.</p>

<p>Student workers/employees/interns who remain on campus and want to continue working may be able to maintain their normal work schedule. As the situation continues to develop, be in contact with your supervisor.</p>
<p>
    For graduate students appointed in a graduate position receiving a monthly stipend (Graduate Research Assistant, Graduate Teaching Assistant, Graduate Student Trainee) stipend payments will continue.  Please consult your Mentor or Graduate Program Director regarding ongoing research and teaching obligations in order to coordinate a plan for on-campus work.  Graduate Students appointed in to a “Graduate Assistant” position (paid bi-weekly), will be paid for a period of 14 days, and then UAB will reassess.
</p>

<p>Student Health will remain open, but anyone who suspects that they might be contagious should call first — 205-934-3580 during regular hours or 205-934-3411 after hours to page the provider on call.</p>

<p>We know you will have more questions, and we are working to organize a webinar/online town hall to answer them and make this transition as smooth as possible.</p>

<p>We continue to work toward the continued well-being of our UAB community, especially our students. </p></div>
