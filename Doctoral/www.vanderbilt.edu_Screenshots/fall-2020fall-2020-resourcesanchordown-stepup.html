<p><strong>For those who work in a higher-risk environment for infection with COVID-19 (e.g., some research facilities, VUPS, dining, child care, etc.), your department may require temperature  and symptom screening upon arrival to work.</strong> Your supervisor will advise you on this requirement prior to your return to campus and on where to report when you arrive for screening. Temperature screening on campus allows the university to know immediately if someone is symptomatic so that they can be directed to the VUMC COVID Hotline at 888-312-0847 for coordination of testing. As with all other absences, the faculty/staff/postdoc is responsible for informing their supervisor/mentor/dean.

<h4>GRADUATE/PROFESSIONAL STUDENTS NOW</h4>
<p>Students who are on campus now who have symptoms related to COVID-19 or determine that they need to be tested based on potential exposure are encouraged to contact Student Health (615-322-2427). Individuals who need emergency care should contact 911 for ambulance transport to the nearest Emergency Department.</p>
<h4>GRADUATE/PROFESSIONAL STUDENT FUTURE</h4>
<p>Vanderbilt University is establishing its COVID-19 safety model by leveraging collaboration and partnership with the world-class Vanderbilt University Medical Center and Vanderbilt University School of Nursing to support and protect the Vanderbilt University community as much as possible.</p>
<p>As a core component of our preventive measures, we will have requirements for COVID-19 safety such as offering on-campus testing, rigorous contact tracing and symptom management. We are partnering closely with the experts at VUMC and our School of Nursing to deploy their best practices in these areas. Additional details about the university’s plans to implement these best practices, as well as the varying testing requirements for different groups of students—which may include testing prior to arriving on, upon return to, or during their time on campus—will be shared by July 15.</p>
<p>At the current time, asymptomatic testing is not routinely recommended by either <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/shared-congregate-house/index.html">CDC</a><strong> and the </strong><a href="https://acha-test.app.box.com/s/k202537ahi3w27b0w6cdhqxynr3vljif">ACHA</a> for faculty, staff, or graduate and professional students who live in apartment-style housing or single-family homes instead of residence halls.  The Metro Nashville Public Health Department is offering free asymptomatic testing to anyone who wants it at their testing sites available at <a href="https://www.asafenashville.org/">asafenashville.org</a>.</p>
<h3>WHILE ON CAMPUS</h3>
<p>Graduate and professional students who have symptoms related to COVID-19 should contact Student Health (615-322-2427). Individuals who need emergency care should contact 911 for ambulance transport to the nearest Emergency Department. Students who determine they need to be tested based on potential exposure but do not have any symptoms will receive testing, and more details regarding that testing will be provided by July 15.</p>
<h5>POSITIVE CASE AND CONTACT TRACING</h5>
<h4>ALL STUDENTS NOW</h4>
<p>Students who test positive for COVID-19 must self-isolate as directed by the dean of students until they have recovered. To help determine the risk of potential exposure to others on campus, Student Health or Public Health officials will conduct <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/php/open-america/contact-tracing-resources.html">contact tracing</a> with the individual who has tested positive. Exposed individuals will be given the name of the individual who tested positive so that their risk can be assessed.</p>
<p>Vanderbilt is following the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/if-you-are-sick/end-home-isolation.html">CDC’s recommended recovery strategy</a>. If an individual had symptoms, recovery status is assigned when: 1) the individual remains fever free without the use of fever reducers for 72 hours, 2) symptoms have improved, and 3) it has been at least 10 days since their symptoms first appeared. If an individual tested positive for COVID-19 but had no symptoms, the individual can be cleared to return 10 days after the test, as long as the individual does not develop symptoms. If the individual develops symptoms, then the individual must follow the recovery strategy for those with symptoms. Notification for return to on-campus activities is directed through Student Health.</p>
<h4>GRADUATE/PROFESSIONAL STUDENT FUTURE</h4>
<p>To help determine the risk of potential exposure to others on campus, the School of Nursing Nurse Faculty Practice Division in partnership with Student Health will conduct contact tracing with any student who has tested positive. Vanderbilt will have robust in-house contact tracing capabilities developed as a collaboration with experts at VUMC, VUSN and Metro Public Health to coordinate timely contact tracing between campus and the Nashville community. More details to be provided by July 15.</p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Vanderbilt is employing the best practice, gold standard polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing method as recommended by VUMC experts and will continue to evaluate all testing options and methods moving forward recognizing options are continually evolving. </span></p>
<h3>WHILE ON CAMPUS</h3>
<p>Students who have symptoms related to COVID-19 should contact Student Health (615-322-2427). Individuals who need emergency care should contact 911 for ambulance transport to the nearest Emergency Department. Students who determine they need to be tested based on potential exposure but do not have any symptoms will receive testing.</p>
<p>VU will set up a testing center in partnership with VUMC and the School of Nursing that will offer testing to asymptomatic individuals who meet testing criteria developed in partnership with VUMC infectious disease experts.  These capabilities will be in place before students return to campus.  The criteria for asymptomatic testing will be reviewed and revised as conditions on campus and in the community change.</p>
<p><strong>More details regarding that testing will be provided by July 15.</strong></p>
<h3>TESTING DETAILS</h3>
<p><span class="s1">Vanderbilt is currently evaluating manufacturers for best-in-class options for large-scale asymptomatic testing and will be partnering with VUMC for testing of any student exhibiting symptoms of COVID-19.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Vanderbilt is currently evaluating testing labs for best-in-class turnaround time for large-scale asymptomatic testing and will be partnering with VUMC for testing of any student exhibiting symptoms of COVID-19 for the most rapid turnaround time possible. The time frame for results depends on a large number of factors including current volume being processed by a testing lab at any given time so is difficult to predict.</span></p>
<h5>POSITIVE CASE AND CONTACT TRACING</h5>
<h4>ALL STUDENTS NOW</h4>
<p>Students who test positive for COVID-19 must self-isolate as directed by the dean of students until they have recovered. To help determine the risk of potential exposure to others on campus, Student Health or Public Health officials will conduct <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/php/open-america/contact-tracing-resources.html">contact tracing</a> with the individual who has tested positive. Exposed individuals will be given the name of the individual who tested positive so that their risk can be assessed.</p>
<p>Vanderbilt is following the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/if-you-are-sick/end-home-isolation.html">CDC’s recommended recovery strategy</a>. If an individual had symptoms, recovery status is assigned when: 1) the individual remains fever-free without the use of fever reducers for 72 hours, 2) symptoms have improved, and 3) it has been at least 10 days since their symptoms first appeared. If an individual tested positive for COVID-19 but had no symptoms, the individual can be cleared to return 10 days after the test as long as the individual does not develop symptoms. If the individual develops symptoms, then the individual must follow the recovery strategy for those with symptoms. Notification for return to on-campus activities is directed through Student Health.</p>
<h4>UNDERGRADUATE STUDENT FUTURE</h4>
<p>To help determine the risk of potential exposure to others on campus, the School of Nursing Nurse Faculty Practice Division in partnership with Student Health will conduct contact tracing with any student who has tested positive. Vanderbilt will have robust in-house contact tracing capabilities developed as a collaboration with experts at VUMC, VUSN and Metro Public Health to coordinate timely contact tracing between campus and the Nashville community.  <strong>More details to be provided by July 15.</strong></p>

COVID-19 conditions mean we needed to identify quarantine and isolation locations for our undergraduate residential community and to de-densify residential spaces to provide housing that is as safe as possible. The CDC defines <strong>isolation</strong> as separating sick people with a contagious disease from people who are not sick and <strong>quarantine</strong> as separating and restricting the movement of people who were exposed to a contagious disease to see if they become sick.</p>
<p><strong>Blakemore House (an on-campus residence hall) and Scarritt Bennett Center (an off-campus property operated by the university and located in close proximity to campus) will be used for campus resident isolation and quarantine space.</strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">University health officials will make medical determinations and assign campus residents to either diagnostic quarantine or COVID-positive isolation to sites specifically designated for these purposes. </span><span class="s1">University health officials will make medical evaluations and release campus residents from quarantine or isolation to return to their campus residence hall room when deemed medically appropriate.</span></p>
<p>For students living off campus, we cannot offer isolation space on campus due to resource constraints. Public health guidance suggests that we treat students residing together off campus like a family unit; students should isolate in their off campus residence and handle isolation as family would. Furthermore, university health officials will make medical determinations and direct students to quarantine or isolate at their off-campus residences. When deemed appropriate after medical evaluations, university health officials will release students from quarantine or isolation in their off-campus residences.</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Student Health will work with all such students to do regular symptom monitoring and will hospitalize anyone who becomes seriously ill.</span></p>
<p>As a core component of our preventive measures, the university will have requirements for <a href="https://nam04.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.vanderbilt.edu%2Fcoronavirus%2Ffaqs%2Fundergraduate-student-covid-19-testing%2F&amp;data=02%7C01%7Canna.thomas%40Vanderbilt.Edu%7C2b3758e27301429a682a08d80f180a8e%7Cba5a7f39e3be4ab3b45067fa80faecad%7C0%7C0%7C637275943221780791&amp;sdata=2GPgvA2PwveTpYMi3895FvTbLDQaA1OcJqxX3OHCVwg%3D&amp;reserved=0">COVID-19 testing, as well as rigorous contact tracing and symptom management</a> that are in alignment with recommendations from the <a href="https://nam04.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fcoronavirus%2F2019-ncov%2Fcommunity%2Fshared-congregate-house%2Findex.html&amp;data=02%7C01%7Canna.thomas%40Vanderbilt.Edu%7C2b3758e27301429a682a08d80f180a8e%7Cba5a7f39e3be4ab3b45067fa80faecad%7C0%7C0%7C637275943221780791&amp;sdata=wmphI4%2FqQCIuSdTrDQG0DyYWLKz5nhOCjzNC4TbpvJo%3D&amp;reserved=0">CDC</a> and the <a href="https://nam04.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Facha-test.app.box.com%2Fs%2Fk202537ahi3w27b0w6cdhqxynr3vljif&amp;data=02%7C01%7Canna.thomas%40Vanderbilt.Edu%7C2b3758e27301429a682a08d80f180a8e%7Cba5a7f39e3be4ab3b45067fa80faecad%7C0%7C0%7C637275943221790796&amp;sdata=tr9W7QqhcMwUg6OibWqudb3Qo85SKtOPoQsT4vDVfZ8%3D&amp;reserved=0">ACHA</a>. We are partnering closely with experts at Vanderbilt University Medical Center and our School of Nursing to deploy their best practices in these areas.</p>

<p>Faculty, staff and postdocs who have symptoms related to COVID-19 or determine that they need to be tested based on potential exposure are encouraged to call Occupational Health at 615-936-0955. Individuals who need emergency care should contact 911 for ambulance transport to the nearest Emergency Department.</p>
<p>Individuals who have symptoms or may have been exposed and are off campus may contact Occupational Health or may also contact their primary care provider for COVID-19 testing locations in their area.</p>
<p>If a faculty member, staff member, or postdoc believes they have contracted COVID-19 after exposure to a known COVID-positive person on campus and/or while performing job duties, health care professionals may direct the individual to complete a First Report of Work Injury or Illness. The individual who has been exposed must stop work immediately and leave campus, even if the individual is not showing symptoms. The individual is required to notify their supervisor that they are leaving and notify Occupational Health that they have been exposed and/or developed symptoms. An individual awaiting test results must remain at home in self-isolation and keep their supervisor/mentor/dean informed of their return-to-campus status.</p>
<p>At the current time, asymptomatic testing is not routinely recommended by either <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/shared-congregate-house/index.html">CDC</a>and the<a href="https://acha-test.app.box.com/s/k202537ahi3w27b0w6cdhqxynr3vljif">ACHA</a> for faculty, staff, or post-docs who live in apartment-style housing or single-family homes instead of residence halls.  The Metro Nashville Public Health Department is offering free asymptomatic testing to anyone who wants it at their testing sites available at <a href="https://www.asafenashville.org/">asafenashville.org</a>.</p>
<p>Insurance provider Aetna is taking significant steps in response to COVID-19. Effective immediately, Aetna will waive co-pays and member cost share for all diagnostic testing related to COVID-19. This will cover the test kit for patients who meet CDC guidelines for testing, which can be performed in any approved laboratory location.</p>

<h4>Positive Case and Contact Tracing</h4>
<p>Faculty, staff, postdocs who test positive for COVID-19 must self-isolate at home and follow current CDC guidance. To help determine the risk of potential exposure to co-workers and others on campus, Occupational Health will conduct contact tracing with the individual who has tested positive. Exposed individuals will be given the name of the individual who tested positive so that their risk can be assessed. Occupational Health may contact the supervisor if further contact tracing of the COVID-19 positive individual is needed; however, the actual test result (and any other protected health information) will not be disclosed.</p>
<p>Individuals who have been exposed to a COVID-19 positive person are entered into Occupational Health’s symptom monitoring survey that is completed daily. The objective is to inform individuals of known exposures and to closely monitor each individual to ensure that any signs of infection are addressed early.</p>
<p>Vanderbilt is following CDC’s recommended recovery strategy. If an individual had symptoms, recovery status (and clearance to return to campus/work) is assigned when: 1) the individual remains fever-free without the use of fever reducers for 72 hours, 2) symptoms have improved, and 3) it has been at least 10 days since their symptoms first appeared. If the individual tested positive for COVID-19 but had no symptoms, the individual can be cleared to return 10 days after the test as long as the individual does not develop symptoms. If the individual develops symptoms, then the individual must follow the recovery strategy for those with symptoms. Notification for return to on-campus activities is directed through Occupational Health.</p>

If physical distancing is possible, individuals working in private offices or laboratory environments that do not otherwise require face masks/coverings may remove their face masks/coverings while in such spaces. Appropriate use of face masks/coverings is important in minimizing risks to the wearers and those around them according to both <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/diy-cloth-face-coverings.html">CDC</a> and <a href="https://acha-test.app.box.com/s/k202537ahi3w27b0w6cdhqxynr3vljif">ACHA</a> guidance. You could spread COVID-19 to others even if you do not feel sick. The face mask/covering is not a substitute for physical distancing. This applies to off-site and leased building space, as well as on the main Vanderbilt campus, both indoors and outdoors.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.2rem">Each faculty member, staff member, postdoc and student will be provided with one cloth face covering. Disposable masks will be provided, if needed. Individuals and departments can contact their assigned building manager or liaison in their college, school or department to acquire cloth face coverings or disposable masks. You also may wear homemade cloth face coverings that adhere to CDC and other public health recommendations. This will help Vanderbilt reduce the need to purchase additional masks, which are in short supply. A disposable mask must not be used for more than one day. See details regarding face mask/covering use and care below.</span></p>
<p>An individual who is having difficulty wearing a face mask/covering should contact <a href="https://www.vumc.org/health-wellness/occupational-health/">Occupational Health</a> (faculty, staff, postdoc) or <a href="https://www.vumc.org/student-health/">Student Health</a> (student) for direction.

Throughout the pandemic, Plant Operations has monitored and adopted CDC recommendations.</p>
<p>The CDC’s “<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/colleges-universities/considerations.html">Considerations for Institutes of Higher Education</a>,” May 30 updated guidance specifically recommends routine disinfecting and cleaning of surfaces and objects that are frequently touched using the cleaners typically used, according to the directions on the label. The CDC says that most common EPA-registered <a href="https://www.epa.gov/pesticide-registration/list-n-disinfectants-use-against-sars-cov-2-covid-19">household disinfectants</a> should be effective.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">At a minimum, there will be twice daily disinfecting of high-touch areas throughout campus. Classrooms will be disinfected daily during routine cleaning. Disinfecting wipes will be provided in classrooms and other spaces for use by the occupants. Facilities is also implementing zone-based disinfectant teams who will be easily identifiable.</span></p>
<p>Facilities will follow <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/disinfecting-building-facility.html">CDC guidelines</a> <span style="font-size: 1.2rem">for cleaning of outdoor areas, which calls for routine cleaning.</span></p>
<p>Plant Operations staff received cleaning and disinfection protocols training at the onset of the pandemic and will attend future training sessions on the latest protocols. In accordance with CDC and university guidelines, all staff members will wear the required personal protective equipment including face masks/coverings while on campus.</p>
<p>In addition to normal cleaning routines, custodial staff will also disinfect frequently touched surfaces or high-touch points and objects using EPA approved products. Examples of frequently touched surfaces and objects that will receive the minimal twice-daily disinfection are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tables in common spaces</li>
<li>Doorknobs</li>
<li>Light switches</li>
<li>Door handles</li>
<li>Hand railings</li>
<li>Bathroom stalls</li>
<li>Sink handles</li>
<li>Grab bars</li>
<li>Water fountains</li>
</ul>
<p>Cleaning services for public/common spaces such as restrooms, lounges, lobbies, and hallways will be increased. Other duties such as emptying trash, vacuuming/cleaning of floors of private offices once per week will continue. Otherwise, cleaning/disinfecting of private offices and work areas will be the responsibility of occupants.</p>
<p>The following will NOT be cleaned by custodial staff.</p>
<ul>
<li>Desks</li>
<li>Keyboards</li>
<li>Touch screens</li>
<li>Remote controls</li>
</ul>
<p>Disposable wipes will be made available through each school/college’s and department’s building or facilities officer so that commonly used surfaces and objects can be wiped down before use. For soft surfaces such as carpeted floors or fabric in seating areas, guidance indicates to continue cleaning with cleaners appropriate for use on these surfaces and disinfecting with appropriate product for the specific surfaces; vacuum carpets as usual.</p>
<h3>Hand Sanitizing Products and Touchless Features</h3>
<ul>
<li>Hand sanitizing stations will be located at key areas within all campus buildings.</li>
<li>Sanitizing products such as hand pumps and wipes will be available at key locations (ingress/egress, elevator lobbies, etc.) and can be obtained through each school/college’s and department’s building or facilities officer.</li>
<li>Foot pulls will be installed on doors of high-use areas such as restrooms.</li>
<li>Plant Operations will gradually replace hand-operated paper towels and soap dispensers with touchless products in restrooms.</li>
</ul>
<p>These practices will continue to evolve as the CDC releases new recommendations.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.epa.gov/coronavirus/frequent-questions-about-indoor-air-and-coronavirus-covid-19">guidance</a> from these sources is very similar and falls into three basic categories:</p>
<ul>
<li>Increasing the amount of outside air being delivered to spaces</li>
<li>Using high-efficiency filtration in systems that circulate air around large numbers of spaces</li>
<li>Maintaining temperature and humidity levels within spaces</li>
</ul>
<p>The university is implementing strategies to comply with these guidelines. The Facilities Department is also working to implement an overnight cycle during which buildings are flushed with an increased volume of outside air without exceeding the heating and cooling system capacities.</p>
<p>The Facilities Department will continue to adhere to <a href="https://www.ashrae.org/technical-resources/filtration-disinfection#mechanical">ASHRAE published guidance</a> for safe and healthy buildings, which emphasizes increased fresh-air ventilation and close management of indoor air quality, temperature and humidity.</p>
<p>To keep the Vanderbilt community as healthy as possible, indoor conditions will be maintained at temperatures ranging from 68 to 76 degrees and relative humidity of 45 to 50 percent.</p>
<p>Although the university is implementing these extra safety measures, it is up to each member of the Vanderbilt community to practice <a href="https://www.vanderbilt.edu/coronavirus/faqs/safety-guidance-physical-distancing/">physical distancing</a>, <a href="https://www.vanderbilt.edu/coronavirus/faqs/handwashing/">washing or sanitizing hands</a>, and using <a href="https://www.vanderbilt.edu/coronavirus/faqs/face-masks/">face masks/coverings</a> in all public spaces on campus to limit the spread of COVID-19, as recommended by the CDC.</p>

Physical distancing is especially important for people who are at higher risk. Individuals on campus should follow these physical distancing practices:</p>
<ul>
<li>Stay at least 6 feet (about 2 arms’ length) from other people.</li>
<li>Do not gather in groups.</li>
<li>Stay out of crowded places and avoid mass gatherings.</li>
