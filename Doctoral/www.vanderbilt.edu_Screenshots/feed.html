				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The university remains in Phase 2 of its Vanderbilt Return to Campus plan as Mayor John Cooper announced today that Nashville will <a href="https://www.asafenashville.org/">revert to phase 2 of its Roadmap to Reopening Nashville Plan with modifications</a>.</p>
<p>Vanderbilt moved to Phase 2 of its Return to Campus Plan on Monday, June 8. The university’s plan can be viewed on the <a href="https://www.vanderbilt.edu/coronavirus/">Return to Campus website</a>.</p>
<p>“We want our community to know that our current status and plans are not affected by the city’s decision. We remain in Phase 2 of Vanderbilt’s plan, which includes more strict health and safety guidelines than the city’s Phase 2 plan and was designed with our unique residential education and research environment in mind,” Vice Chancellor for Administration Eric Kopstain said. “We continue to closely track the number of new infections in Nashville and across Tennessee and will make adjustments as needed in response to new information.”</p>
<p>“We remain on track to welcome our students back to campus this fall and are taking every precaution we can to ensure as much as possible the health and safety of our entire community as we do so. We are all in this together and it will take all of us stepping up and working together to help slow the spread of this virus,” he said.</p>
<p>The university also continues to gather recommendations from the federal government and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and seek guidance from nationally renowned public health experts at Vanderbilt University Medical Center.</p>
<p>To help slow the spread of COVID-19 in our community, you should:</p>
<ul>
<li>Wear a face mask/covering in public settings</li>
<li>Maintain six feet of physical distance from others</li>
<li>Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds</li>
<li>Monitor yourself daily for COVID-19 symptoms</li>
</ul>

<p>Dear Vanderbilt community,</p>
<p>We appreciate your patience while we have developed our return to campus plans. We understand uncertainty about the fall semester may have compounded the stress you have been under during these extremely challenging times, and we know all are eager for information that will allow us to look forward and plan for the future. As we shared in mid-May, many groups have been working diligently on plans to reopen the Vanderbilt campus under conditions that are as safe as possible, and we committed to communicating those plans to you as soon as they were completed. Today, we write to share with you Vanderbilt’s plans for the 2020-2021 academic year.</p>
<p>In close consultation with experts at Vanderbilt University Medical Center and our School of Nursing and with information from national, state and local public health officials, we launched the Vanderbilt Return to Campus Plan on May 18. We successfully completed Phase 1 with the initial ramp-up of our on-campus research activities, and on June 8 began transitioning to Phase 2, with a further expansion of research and graduate and professional student experiential learning. All of our planned phases are grounded in the adoption of rigorous safety and prevention protocols. Based on the effectiveness of these actions, and after studying multiple scenarios and best practices, we determined and are very pleased to announce that we will resume on-campus, in-person classes for the fall semester.</p>
<p>A successful fall semester will require every member of our community to work together in the One Vanderbilt spirit. We recognize the strengths of residential education and want our students, faculty and staff to have the chance to be together on campus under the new conditions that the pandemic requires. To accomplish that goal, this fall:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="e2ma-style">In-person, on-campus undergraduate classes will <strong>begin on Monday, August 24, and will conclude on Friday, November 20</strong>. All undergraduate students will complete the final week of classes remotely and then also take final exams remotely through virtual and alternative platforms, with <strong>the semester concluding on Sunday, December 13.</strong><br />
</span></li>
<li><span class="e2ma-style">Academic calendars for <strong>graduate and professional degree programs</strong> will be shared directly with students by their respective deans. Most graduate and professional degree programs will also end in-person classes before Thanksgiving break.<br />
</span></li>
<li><span class="e2ma-style"><strong>There will be no fall break this year.</strong> In addition, we ask that students stay in the Nashville area and not travel away from campus for weekend trips through the end of in-person classes on Friday, November 20.</span></li>
<li><span class="e2ma-style">Undergraduate residential students who are able to do so <strong>will leave campus for the Thanksgiving holiday and will not return to campus until the start of the spring semester.</strong> We are adopting this plan based on current public health guidance regarding risks associated with coming and going to and from campus, and models suggesting a potential resurgence of COVID-19 cases with the onset of influenza season.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>During this pandemic, the health and safety of our Vanderbilt community is uppermost in our minds. We are leveraging the learning, data and experience we have acquired since the pandemic began in January to inform our plans and reduce the risk of COVID-19 spread as much as possible. We will continue to closely track the course of the pandemic and will adjust these plans as necessary in response to the latest public health information.</p>
<h4>Classes and course work</h4>
<p><em>All </em>undergraduate students are invited to return to campus for in-person studies in the fall. We will, however, provide a robust educational experience for all of our students, whether they return to campus or not; the Office of the University Registrar will contact undergraduate students on June 16 with details on how students can apply for remote-only studies, if needed because of their personal circumstances. We ask all undergraduates who choose to apply for this option to communicate with us by June 26.</p>
<p>The University Registrar will also reach out to all undergraduate students by mid-July regarding any specific scheduling or course-related changes; information for graduate and professional students will be communicated by their deans’ offices.</p>
<p>Although we are returning to on-campus, in-person instruction, classes will look and operate differently from the way they have in the past. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="e2ma-style">We intend to practice physical distancing and other protocols to promote health and safety in classrooms. Students will sit farther apart and will wear face masks/coverings. Faculty and teaching assistants also will adopt appropriate public health safety methods.<br />
</span></li>
<li><span class="e2ma-style">A student’s individual course schedule may include some evening and weekend classes, a blend of virtual and alternative and in-person learning, and other approaches.<br />
</span></li>
<li><span class="e2ma-style">We are planning for in-person courses to have options for delivery via a variety of virtual and alternative platforms. This will provide for students who cannot return to campus activities and for those who need to self-isolate or quarantine during the semester. We are investing in new resources to further advance these platforms and will offer an excellent learning experience for all.</span></li>
</ul>
<h4>Undergraduate residential housing</h4>
<p>We know many of you have questions regarding undergraduate housing for the fall semester. Our plan for Vanderbilt-controlled housing this year is student-focused. Given COVID-19 conditions, this means we will de-densify residential spaces to provide housing that is as safe as possible, and we will identify self-isolation and quarantine locations for our residential community.</p>
<p>To meet these goals, we have customized plans for three cohorts of students with different needs: first-year students, returning upper-division students and student-athletes. We are deploying a mix of new approaches, including authorizing more upper-division students to live off campus and securing additional Vanderbilt-controlled housing options in the area. Details about these plans are available on the <strong><a href="https://www.vanderbilt.edu/coronavirus">Return to Campus website.</a></strong></p>
<p>To reduce population density in our dining halls, we will expand opportunities for mobile ordering through Campus Dining and are creating more opportunities for grab-and-go options. We also are modifying circulation and adding contactless “tap” checkouts to promote health and safety in dining halls.</p>
<p>Regardless of where our students reside—in Vanderbilt-controlled housing, off campus, or in remote locations—we are committed to providing programming and support that enhance connections, belonging and community. Campus Life, Student Life and Campus Dining will implement new protocols regarding events, meetings, informal gatherings and access to common areas. Offices across campus also are connecting with student groups to develop new strategies for creative socializing and virtual programming.</p>
<h4>Protecting our community as much as possible</h4>
<p>As we look forward, every one of us will need to fully commit to protecting our collective health and well-being as much as possible and play our individual part in managing the spread of the virus. <strong>At the core of our efforts is prevention of infection.</strong> Public health protocols, including symptom monitoring and temperature checks, mandatory face masks/coverings, public hand-sanitizer stations and physical distancing, will be in place. We will ask all students who return to campus to sign an acknowledgment of such protocols.</p>
<p>The university is also taking actions, such as enhanced cleaning protocols, changes to foot-traffic flow through buildings and on campus pathways, and much more, to ensure all campus spaces and buildings support the health and safety of our students, staff and faculty. Details are available on our <a href="https://www.vanderbilt.edu/coronavirus">Return to Campus website</a>.</p>
<p>And as a core component of our preventive measures, we will have requirements for <strong>COVID-19 testing, as well as rigorous contact tracing and symptom management.</strong> We are partnering with experts at VUMC and our School of Nursing to deploy best practices in these areas. More information about our plans, as well as testing requirements for different groups of students—which may include testing before arriving on campus, upon return to campus, or during students&#8217; time on campus—will be shared on the <a href="https://www.vanderbilt.edu/coronavirus">Return to Campus website</a> by July 15.</p>
<p><strong>We are committed to ensuring all students can be cared for if they are ill or need to quarantine. </strong>The university has identified spaces and protocols to properly care for any residential students who have been exposed. These measures will allow us to continue on-campus instruction while living within an environment where COVID-19 cannot be completely eliminated. Should an outbreak occur or public health conditions change significantly, we will rely on our colleagues at VUMC, as well as local, state and federal officials and public health guidelines, to help us assess if we must send some or all students home. We know some members of our community are likely to test positive this fall, but we are establishing rigorous systems to manage this reality, care for our students and protect our community.</p>
<p>In addition, we are enhancing support for our students’ health and well-being through a new collaboration among the Nurse Faculty Practice Division in the School of Nursing, VUMC and the Student Health Center. The School of Nursing will perform contact tracing for positive cases, provide counseling for any students who are in quarantine and isolation, and provide periodic symptom monitoring for all students. We also will provide new telehealth options, additional programming and more through the <a href="https://www.vanderbilt.edu/studentcarenetwork/">Student Care Network</a>, a holistic network of mental health resources and wellness services available to all Vanderbilt students.</p>
<h4>Shared accountability and working together</h4>
<p>There is no denying that the ways in which we live, learn, interact, study and discover will continue to evolve and change in the coming months. These experiences will be new for all of us. We share in the feeling that there is a long road of uncertainty ahead; however, we firmly believe that our collaborative, innovative and caring Vanderbilt culture positions us well to travel that road successfully and thoughtfully together.</p>
<p>We will hold <strong>virtual town halls for students and families on Wednesday, June 17, at 7 p.m. CDT, and on Saturday, June 20, at 10 a.m. CDT,</strong> when we will discuss this plan and answer your questions on a range of topics. You will receive a separate invitation to register for these events, and we look forward to talking with you then. A recording will be available if you are not able to attend one of the live sessions.</p>
<p>In addition, we have expanded our new and returning student helpline, and we encourage students and parents to contact us with questions at <strong><a href="tel:6153224357">615-322-4357</a>.</strong></p>
<p>And, <strong>we encourage you to visit the <a href="https://www.vanderbilt.edu/coronavirus">Return to Campus website</a> for details and updates.</strong></p>
<p>This is a pivotal moment, and we have a unique opportunity to shape it—as part of a leading research university and as exemplary members of our broader community. As the university’s leaders, during these unusual times, we are committed to the primary goal of fostering a community that welcomes all and provides the transformative learning and discovery opportunities that our students expect from Vanderbilt University.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p><strong>Daniel Diermeier<br />
</strong>Incoming Chancellor, Vanderbilt University<br />
<strong><br />
Susan R. Wente</strong><br />
Interim Chancellor and Provost, Vanderbilt University</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dear faculty colleagues,</p>
<p>Over the past three months, we have experienced many changes and transitions across nearly every aspect of campus and faculty life. Despite the challenges of the pandemic and economic downturn, our progress comes from teamwork across the entire university and our most sincere commitment to serve our students, faculty, staff and postdocs in the best possible way. We all are called to find solutions for living in a COVID-19 world, including making sure we address racial injustice now and after the pandemic ends. This is a time when our role as a research university is more urgent and necessary than ever. Our faculty and staff—engaged in teaching, research, scholarship, creative expression, and advocacy and activism—have my utmost gratitude for their extraordinary work.</p>
<p>We have learned much since March about how to mitigate COVID-19 risks while fulfilling our education and research missions, and we are confident about launching the next steps in the Vanderbilt Return to Campus Plan. Later this morning, Incoming Chancellor Diermeier and I will announce to our community Vanderbilt’s plan for the 2020–2021 academic year and our return to in-person classes (<a href="https://vanderbilt.edu/coronavirus/2020/06/16/june-16-2020-our-plan-for-the-fall-semester">announcement available here</a>). Specific details about the <a href="https://www.vanderbilt.edu/coronavirus/fall-2020-resources/fall-2020-undergraduate-academic-calendar/">undergraduate fall academic calendar</a> are included in today’s announcement. <a href="https://www.vanderbilt.edu/coronavirus/fall-2020-resources/fall-2020-graduate-and-professional-academic-calendars/">Graduate and professional degree program calendars can be found on the Return to Campus Plan website</a>.</p>
<p>As members of our valued and dedicated faculty, you are among the very first to see this plan in its entirety. I am grateful to all of you who joined yesterday’s Faculty Senate co-hosted town hall, where we discussed much of this information. If you were unable to attend, I invite you to <a href="https://vanderbilt.box.com/s/stelk817zanrvm9biee23x54oqlmzzu8">watch a recording of the event</a>.</p>
<p>Our fundamental goal is to protect the health and well-being of each member of our Vanderbilt community as much as possible. This plan results from work conducted by the deans, the associate deans and school/college-specific working groups, as well as multiple faculty/staff ad hoc committees focused on the academic calendar, research operations, campus facilities and buildings, housing, dining and more. Expertise and guidance from <a href="https://news.vanderbilt.edu/2020/03/23/university-launches-public-health-advisory-task-force-in-response-to-covid-19/">Vanderbilt’s Public Health Advisory Task Force</a>, School of Nursing faculty and leaders, and Vanderbilt University Medical Center faculty and leaders, and information from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the American College Health Association and other national organizations, directly inform the health and safety guidelines for our return to campus.</p>
<p>I am grateful for the time, effort and expertise our faculty have brought to this process. For example, faculty in several schools/colleges suggested that in-person classes end at the Thanksgiving holiday, as many universities are planning to do. Likewise, guided by thoughtful comments from many of you, we are working diligently to ensure that new COVID-19-related safeguards are as accessible as possible to meet the needs of our community members with disabilities. Another frequent response was the suggestion to create additional instructional design support; based on this input, I’m pleased to report that we are interviewing candidates for a new assistant director for instructional design at the <a href="https://cft.vanderbilt.edu/">Center for Teaching</a> and expect to have that person in place soon.</p>
<p>Although the scientific understanding of COVID-19 continues to evolve, and we will continue to adjust in response to new information, there is broad consensus that the procedures and protocols we are implementing are effective in slowing the spread of the virus. All are outlined on the <a href="https://www.vanderbilt.edu/coronavirus">Return to Campus Plan website</a>, which I urge you to consult regularly and to read thoroughly. It is the primary source of information about Vanderbilt’s reopening and will continue to be updated.</p>
<h3><a href="http://vanderbilt.edu/coronavirus/fall-2020">RETURN TO CAMPUS PLAN&gt;&gt;</a></h3>
<h4>Developing the academic calendars</h4>
<p>We did not rush into decisions about how to restart in-person classes since making the difficult decision in March to move the remainder of Vanderbilt’s spring semester classes to virtual and alternative platforms. The school/college deans and associate deans, along with any committees they engaged, <a href="https://www.vanderbilt.edu/coronavirus/fall-2020-resources/fall-2020-graduate-and-professional-academic-calendars/">developed the academic calendars</a> we are announcing today. Our objective was to apply all available information, including that from our faculty’s experiences and the requirements of our numerous accreditation bodies, and to be strategic regarding our resources. The key components of the new calendars are <strong>no breaks during the semester and the end of in-person classes on November 20, the Friday before Thanksgiving week. </strong>Through these changes, we eliminate the uncertainties inherent in travel to and from campus.</p>
<h4>Protocols for our faculty&#8217;s health, safety and well-being</h4>
<p>As discussed in our town halls, your health, safety, well-being, and ability to teach and conduct your scholarship at the highest level are of the utmost importance to me and to all university leaders. With <a href="https://www.vanderbilt.edu/coronavirus/faqs/vanderbilt-return-to-campus-phase-two-continue/">Phase 2 of the Vanderbilt Return to Campus Plan </a>underway, we have increased on-campus opportunities to support your research, scholarship and creative expression safely through careful and deliberate reopening of workspaces, including labs, offices and practice rooms. For specific details and procedures, I refer you to the emails sent by Vice Provost for Research Padma Raghavan on <a href="https://www.vanderbilt.edu/coronavirus/2020/06/05/june-5-2020-transition-to-phase-2-of-research-ramp-up-plan-begins-next-week/">June 5</a> and <a href="https://www.vanderbilt.edu/coronavirus/2020/06/11/june-11-2020-details-of-research-ramp-up-phase-2-process/">June 11</a>. The Heard Library system also continues <a href="https://news.vanderbilt.edu/2020/05/22/no-quarantine-on-information-at-the-heard-libraries/">significantly expanding electronic access to materials and, in Phase 2, increasing the number of pick-up and drop-off locations for faculty to acquire non-digital resources</a>.</p>
<p>With every phase of our <a href="https://www.vanderbilt.edu/coronavirus">Return to Campus Plan</a>, we have put in place four basic public health measures known to slow COVID-19 spread: <a href="https://www.vanderbilt.edu/coronavirus/faqs/safety-guidance-physical-distancing/">physical distancing</a>, <a href="https://www.vanderbilt.edu/coronavirus/faqs/face-masks/">face masks/coverings</a>, <a href="https://www.vanderbilt.edu/coronavirus/faqs/handwashing/">hand-washing</a> and <a href="https://www.vanderbilt.edu/coronavirus/faqs/testing-symptom-monitoring-contact-tracing/">symptom monitoring</a>. Note especially that wearing face masks/coverings is required in all public indoor and outdoor campus locations. <strong>We will provide cloth face masks/coverings to every faculty and staff member on campus</strong>. The university also has secured additional supplies of protective gear, such as disposable masks and hand sanitizer, that will be distributed by each school&#8217;s/college’s facilities manager.</p>
<p>Since we launched Vanderbilt Phase 1 on May 18, more than 1,700 people have returned to campus as part of the research ramp-up and are successfully putting these measures in place on a daily basis. Going forward, we must all continue to adhere to these vital health and safety protocols. I also want to share some of the further safeguards we are implementing:</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.vanderbilt.edu/coronavirus/faqs/classroom-protocols/"><span class="e2ma-style">WORKING IN OFFICE, CLASSROOM and CAMPUS SPACES</span></a><a href="https://www.vanderbilt.edu/coronavirus/faqs/classroom-protocols/"><br />
</a></strong>Physical distancing of 6 feet will be implemented in classrooms. This will <strong>reduce in-person class sizes</strong> and/or result in rescheduling to larger spaces. Classrooms will be <strong>disinfected daily</strong> during routine cleaning. <strong>Disinfecting wipes will be provided in classrooms</strong> and other spaces. An ad hoc working group is also considering additional classroom hygiene provisions, including options for lecturer alternatives to face masks, such as plexiglass barriers or face shields. <strong>Class scheduling</strong> will be adjusted to allow for more time for students and faculty to travel from one class to another. When feasible, <a href="https://www.vanderbilt.edu/coronavirus/faqs/entry-exit-control/">dedicated entrances and exits</a> will be designated to minimize congestion during class changes.</p>
<p>High-touch areas, including in academic buildings, <strong>will be disinfected at least twice per day</strong>. <strong>Restroom signage</strong> will promote physical distancing and protocols, and disinfection methods will be fully deployed. Hand sanitizer dispensers will be placed at entrance and exit points for buildings on campus, as well as near elevators. Doors will be automated, where possible. The Vanderbilt Facilities Department is also <strong>increasing the amount of outside air being delivered to spaces</strong>, using high-efficiency filtration in systems that circulate air around large numbers of spaces and monitoring temperature and humidity levels within spaces.</p>
<p><strong><span class="e2ma-style"><a href="https://www.vanderbilt.edu/coronavirus/faqs/covid-19-testing/">SYMPTOM MONITORING, TESTING AND TRACING</a></span></strong><br />
We are partnering closely with the experts in the School of Nursing and at VUMC to deploy best practices related to <strong>symptom monitoring, testing, rigorous contact identification and tracking, and quarantining and isolating</strong> when necessary. All undergraduate students will be required to complete a pre-arrival COVID-19 test and will be tested upon arrival on campus. All members of the Vanderbilt community are expected to self-monitor for COVID-19 symptoms, and undergraduate, graduate and professional students must conduct symptom monitoring and will be tested if symptomatic.</p>
<p><strong>If faculty, staff or postdocs become symptomatic, they must contact Occupational Health, which will guide them through the screening and testing process.</strong> Any student, faculty, staff member or postdoc identified as a contact of someone who has tested positive for COVID-19, defined as having been within 6 feet of that person for 15 or more continuous minutes, will be tested. We are also considering periodic testing of different university sub-populations.</p>
<p>As stated in the community letter, the university has identified spaces and protocols to properly care for any residential students who have been exposed. These measures will allow us to continue on-campus instruction while living within an environment where COVID-19 cannot be completely eliminated. Should an outbreak occur, or public health conditions change significantly, we will rely on our colleagues at the School of Nursing and VUMC, as well as local, state and federal officials and public health guidelines, to help us assess whether we must send some or all students home.</p>
<p>These are just some of the steps that we are taking to ensure a safe-as-possible return to campus; I strongly encourage you to explore the <a href="https://www.vanderbilt.edu/coronavirus">Return to Campus Plan website for full information.</a></p>
<h4>Faculty resources, support and school-specific information</h4>
<p>In my <a href="https://www.vanderbilt.edu/coronavirus/2020/05/12/may-12-2020-planning-for-the-fall-semester/">May 12 message</a>, I discussed our framework for achieving our goal to have in-person classes on campus this fall. This framework included the continued need for physical distancing, the need to have plans for in-person classes also to be delivered by virtual and alternative teaching methods, and the understanding that curricular decisions will be made on a local level, taking into account the unique standards and expectations across our different schools and colleges.</p>
<p>Today, these components of our plan still ring true. We move forward with different hybrid and blended teaching models that include a combination of in-person, virtual and alternative platforms. This approach is the most flexible, allows for contingency planning, and is informed by our understanding that some members of our community—including faculty and <a href="https://www.vanderbilt.edu/coronavirus/faqs/undergraduate-students-not-returning-opting-for-remote-only/">students</a>—will not be able to return to campus because of <a href="https://www.vanderbilt.edu/coronavirus/faqs/international-students-not-returning-opting-for-remote-only-instruction/">travel and visa restrictions</a> as well as <a href="https://www.vanderbilt.edu/coronavirus/faqs/accommodations-process-for-those-in-high-risk-health-groups/">health concerns</a> and personal circumstances.</p>
<p><strong>Again, decisions and discussions regarding courses that may need to be taught using only virtual and alternative platforms will be made in your colleges and schools. </strong>We are committed to providing additional tools for adaptive course design, including investments for expanded classroom information technology, Center for Teaching resources, and access to instructional design experts through iDesign.</p>
<p>I empathize with the fact that it will be a big transition to return to campus and in-person classroom environments and further to develop the hybrid course curriculums. I miss truly “seeing” my colleagues and look forward to appropriate in-person gatherings, but I also know that the new campus protocols will make everything seem very different. I understand that some faculty members may feel concerned about what a return to campus entails. This is a topic we discussed at yesterday’s town hall, and we will continue to invest in new resources to support you on all levels and to protect your health and well-being as much as possible.</p>
<p>Along those lines, one of our priorities at this time is to <a href="https://www.vanderbilt.edu/coronavirus/faqs/school-and-childcare-working-group/">develop contingency plans related to child care in the fall</a>, should local public schools and child care facilities not reopen fully or be forced to close once again. We have assembled a working group to address these issues.</p>
<p>As a follow-up to yesterday’s town hall and today’s announcement, <strong>Incoming Chancellor Diermeier, Vice Chancellor Eric Kopstain and I will host a virtual town hall at 11:30 a.m. on Monday, June 22,</strong> to provide another opportunity to discuss the plans for the 2020–2021 academic year. You will receive a separate invitation to that event, and I hope you will join us.</p>
<h4>Working toward our future together</h4>
<p>As always, our mission is the connecting thread through our actions: We are doing all of this to advance research, discovery and creative expression—and to provide an excellent education to every Vanderbilt student. The well-being of our community is absolutely central to our continued success in pursuit of this mission.</p>
<p>Now, more than ever, our community depends on our One Vanderbilt ethos of collaboration. Whether through your deans, future town halls, the input we are collecting through the University Continuity Working Group or other appropriate means, please let us know your questions and needs as we approach the fall semester.</p>
<p>Thank you for your dedication to our mission, to our students, staff and postdocs, to each other and to the health and safety of our entire community.<br />
<strong><br />
Susan R. Wente</strong><br />
Interim Chancellor and Provost, Vanderbilt University</p>

Thanks in large part to the responsibility and care around COVID-19 protections demonstrated by our pioneering researchers in Phase 1 of our research ramp-up and to the incredible efforts of our <a href="https://nam04.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Ft.e2ma.net%2Fclick%2Ftirn0d%2Fhl52rfb%2Fdy0woeb&amp;data=02%7C01%7Ckatherine.s.keith%40vanderbilt.edu%7C144283546d3f422f99f508d809a5e1bf%7Cba5a7f39e3be4ab3b45067fa80faecad%7C0%7C0%7C637269955343756600&amp;sdata=NNXwZRqVHCtplWwUq90mU824VWyNALRZGV0eWWnFanY%3D&amp;reserved=0"><span class="s2"><b>ad hoc phased research ramp-up working group</b></span></a> in partnership with the Division of Administration, we have now been approved to advance into Phase 2 of the <a href="https://nam04.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Ft.e2ma.net%2Fclick%2Ftirn0d%2Fhl52rfb%2Ftq1woeb&amp;data=02%7C01%7Ckatherine.s.keith%40vanderbilt.edu%7C144283546d3f422f99f508d809a5e1bf%7Cba5a7f39e3be4ab3b45067fa80faecad%7C0%7C0%7C637269955343766595&amp;sdata=8ZV8WOcPm%2BHI%2BpImP9iJBiYxBTbkp5Q9XvhKpm1SdGY%3D&amp;reserved=0"><span class="s2"><b>4-Phase Research Ramp-Up Plan</b></span></a> gradually starting next week.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Phase 2 will have several important components that will advance the work of our researchers and scholars inclusively across all disciplines. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Most importantly, in Phase 2 research studies involving research participants will be allowed on campus based on a review-and-approvals process similar to that undertaken in Phase 1, with an intake form accessible to all. We know that many of your studies with research participants must be resumed quickly not only to advance research goals, but also to make sure life-improving interventions for participants are not further delayed. While fieldwork off campus cannot be undertaken across the board with COVID-19 still presenting serious challenges to health safety, if your study requires fieldwork within the Metro Nashville area, please consult your dean’s office to see if an exception can be justifiably considered. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Additionally, Phase 2 will enable approved Phase 1 lead researchers to build on the plans they have already implemented to advance to no more than 50 percent of normal research space occupancy, subject to minimum 6-feet physical distancing and other safety protocols such as personal protective equipment. We have developed new RedCAP tools for easy intake form submission and rapid review and approval to reduce administrative burdens on our research community for scale-up to Phase 2 and all future phases. For example, each lead researcher’s Phase 2 Intake Form will be tailored based on whether they previously submitted a Phase 1 Intake Form, allowing those who have already created or implemented approved Phase 1 plans to simply adjust those plans for Phase 2 rather than beginning again from scratch.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Finally, in Phase 2, in addition to “ad-hoc” access, deans may also approve access for faculty members to return to their office spaces to perform research or scholarly activities if building occupancy remains at less than 50 percent and subject to building readiness as confirmed by the Division of Administration. Your dean’s office will be in touch soon with further details as they will be managing such access.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Early next week, we will be sharing the RedCAP Phase 2 Intake Form, additional guidance to help you implement COVID-19 safety protections in your research (e.g., prescreening questions for research participants), and other resources to support your transition to Phase 2. All resources will be made available on the <a href="https://nam04.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Ft.e2ma.net%2Fclick%2Ftirn0d%2Fhl52rfb%2F9i2woeb&amp;data=02%7C01%7Ckatherine.s.keith%40vanderbilt.edu%7C144283546d3f422f99f508d809a5e1bf%7Cba5a7f39e3be4ab3b45067fa80faecad%7C0%7C0%7C637269955343766595&amp;sdata=E7icGGg%2B7wYKt2eeqe%2FpLJEghghtprzrgvkwlmlxZsw%3D&amp;reserved=0"><span class="s2"><b>VU Research website</b></span></a>, and you will receive a follow-up email from me at the time of posting as well as additional guidance from your dean’s office.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In the meantime, to help you begin planning for your Phase 2 transition, we wanted to share the <a href="https://cdn.vanderbilt.edu/vu-wp0/wp-content/uploads/sites/275/2020/06/06173818/VU-Phase-2-Intake-Form-PDF_NOT-FOR-SUBMISSION.pdf"><span class="s2"><b>PDF version of the Phase 2 Intake Form</b></span></a>. However, please note that the PDF version includes all possible items, while the RedCAP version of the form will tailor your form to your specific research activities and automatically populate certain fields if you submitted a Phase 1 Intake Form. As such, your actual Phase 2 Intake Form will likely include far fewer items and be significantly shorter than the full PDF version. <b>Please do not submit PDF versions of the Phase 2 Intake Form for review, and instead use the RedCAP Phase 2 Intake Form when it becomes available early next week.</b></span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Vanderbilt University will begin transitioning to Phase 2 of its  <a href="https://www.vanderbilt.edu/coronavirus/campus-return/">Return to Campus Plan</a> on Monday, June 8.</p>
<p>The Return to Campus Plan is tailored to Vanderbilt’s own unique density, operations and other considerations as a residential education institution. The first phase of the Return to Campus Plan began Monday, May 18, and operations that resumed were on-campus research activities that could not be conducted remotely.</p>
<p>The major change that will occur during this next phase of the plan includes on-campus research ramp up to no more than 50 percent capacity. <b>Those who conduct research activities will receive follow-up information with details on Monday.</b></p>
<p>The university will continue to ramp up various operations in orderly, sequential phases and will communicate with the Vanderbilt community in advance of each phase.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.vanderbilt.edu/coronavirus/campus-return/"><b>The Return to Campus Plan can be viewed on the university’s COVID-19 website. &gt;&gt;</b></a></p>
<p>The following steps and precautions remain in place on the Vanderbilt campus during the university’s Phase 2:</p>
<ul>
<li>On-campus research and scholarly activities will transition to Phase 2 of the <a href="https://research.vanderbilt.edu/resources-for-4-phase-research-ramp-up/">4-Phase Research Ramp-up Plan</a>, with all the COVID-19 related safety guidelines in place (e.g., physical distancing, use of personal protective equipment, etc.)</li>
<li>Graduate and professional student field-based training/learning allowed as informed by on-campus research activities phased opening and/or clinic/occupational site authorization.</li>
<li>Graduate and professional instruction online and preparation for on-campus activity continues.</li>
<li>Undergraduate instruction online and preparation for on-campus activity continues.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>On-campus residential education preparation for on-campus activity continues.</li>
<li>Staff recalled to campus when needed on campus to directly support research, instruction and residential living. Others working remotely.</li>
<li>Staff who are to be recalled to campus will be notified by their supervisors, and only those who need to be on campus to directly support activity ramp-up will be requested to return to campus. Others will continue working remotely.</li>
<li>All those on campus must abide by the protocols outlined in the Return to Campus Plan (e.g., symptom monitoring, face masks/coverings, physical distancing, etc.).</li>
<li>Gatherings up to 10 as long as physical distancing can be maintained and safety protocols (e.g., face masks/coverings) are followed.</li>
</ul>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Dear student,</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Thank you for your patience and understanding as we work through our plans for the resumption of on-campus classes for fall. These plans include adjustments we are making to housing to follow the best public health practices to prevent the spread of COVID-19.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We know many of you have questions and concerns. Several of you have requested more time to consider your options with regard to off-campus housing.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>In response, we are extending the deadline for students to decline their off-campus housing authorization from the initial date of June 5 to five days following the public announcement of Vanderbilt’s plans for the fall semester. The university expects to make that announcement in the next few weeks.</b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">If you have recently declined your off-campus authorization and would like to reconsider your decision, please email <a href="mailto:Alison.matarese@vanderbilt.edu"><span class="s2">Alison.matarese@vanderbilt.edu</span></a>.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We wanted to share some information about how we make decisions regarding on-campus housing assignments that will hopefully help you in making your decision.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The university is still making important decisions on which residence halls will be available for student assignment. Part of that decision process is understanding how many students we will need to accommodate on campus. We have a formula for predicting how many students will live off campus. However, this is an unprecedented situation that does not follow the typical model.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The remaining portion of the assignment process will take several weeks to complete and as a result, assignments for unassigned students will not be known until several weeks after the university’s plans for the fall semester are announced.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Again, thank you for your understanding and for your commitment to Vanderbilt. We look forward to welcoming you back to campus and to do so in a way that first and foremost protects your health and safety as much as possible.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Dear faculty colleagues,</span></p>
<p>Informed and creative teaching is central to the mission of Vanderbilt University, and faculty and staff across campus are working hard to ensure that we continue to fulfill our mission during these challenging times. We all are eager to return to the classroom, but we must do so in a thoughtful and measured way.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Vanderbilt is taking every appropriate precaution to protect you and our entire community as we return to campus and to the classroom. One of those precautions is a streamlined process to evaluate an individual’s concerns about how their personal circumstances may place them at greater risk. Those risks may be the result of their own underlying health condition or age or may be due to the health condition of a family member. If you believe that you will need an accommodation, I encourage you to submit a request as soon as feasible in order to provide the necessary time for consideration of the request and, as appropriate, implementation of an accommodation.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">To initiate a request for a COVID-related accommodation, go to the <a href="https://nam04.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Ft.e2ma.net%2Fclick%2F9en2zd%2Flkj81u%2F9mxjieb&amp;data=02%7C01%7Ckatherine.s.keith%40Vanderbilt.Edu%7C4cf02d30b420474809fa08d8027966dd%7Cba5a7f39e3be4ab3b45067fa80faecad%7C0%7C0%7C637262067750009568&amp;sdata=zeoAh6JLjKqfvW5mVS6uBXRuWkued5Ezq3se1l4SnJU%3D&amp;reserved=0"><span class="s2"><b>Equal Employment Opportunity homepage</b></span></a> on the Vanderbilt University website and select the COVID-19 Accommodation Request tile on the right-hand side of the page. This link will take you the COVID-19 Reasonable Accommodation Request Form. The Reasonable Accommodation Request Form will be sent directly to EEO when you select “Submit” at the bottom of the page after completing the form. If you are requesting an accommodation based on a personal health condition, you will also need to complete the COVID-19 Medical Information Request Form. You may access this form through a link in the Reasonable Accommodation Request Form or through a link at the top of the EEO homepage. When you open the Medical Information Request Form, you will see a link to a form for use with your health care provider. Once that form is completed by you and your health care provider, you may submit the form by attaching it to the digital Medical Information Request Form on the EEO site, via fax (615-343-4709), or by email (<a href="mailto:eeooinfo@vanderbilt.edu"><span class="s2"><b>eeooinfo@vanderbilt.edu</b></span></a>). You will receive confirmation of your submission(s) within one business day.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The EEO team will review the submitted document(s) and will discuss the requested accommodation(s) with the appropriate dean to determine whether a reasonable accommodation can be made that would not create an undue hardship. Requests for accommodations will be evaluated based on an individualized assessment of the basis for the request and the requirements of the faculty position. If your request is missing any necessary documentation or if the EEO team has questions about the requested accommodation(s), a member of the team will contact you. Temporary approval pending submission of a completed Medical Information Request Form may be available if you require additional time to obtain necessary documentation from your health care provider. The EEO team will contact you with a written determination at the conclusion of the review process to inform you whether your request has been approved. If you have questions about your request while it is under review, you may contact EEO at <a href="mailto:eeooinfo@vanderbilt.edu"><span class="s2"><b>eeooinfo@vanderbilt.edu</b></span></a>. Please note that the EEO team will keep your personal medical information confidential; it will be used by that team to evaluate the request for an accommodation and will only be shared as necessary for that purpose.  </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Again, if you plan to request an accommodation related to higher risk for serious illness from COVID-19, I encourage you to submit your request to EEO as soon as possible and, if practicable, no later than June 15 to facilitate preparation for Fall 2020.</span></p>
<p>Thank you,</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Tracey George<br />
Vice Provost of Faculty Affairs</span></p>

<p>Dear graduates and families of the Class of 2020,</p>
<p>I am writing you today with great news. The date for <strong>your on-campus Commencement and graduation festivities</strong> has been set for the <strong>weekend of May 1–2, 2021</strong>. Please mark your calendars!</p>
<p>These dates were selected based on the careful evaluation and recommendations of the <a href="https://nam04.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Ft.e2ma.net%2Fclick%2Fhposzd%2Fxxtu8z%2Fhlp6feb&amp;data=02%7C01%7Ckate.derrick%40vanderbilt.edu%7C58a71b6cb25948304ee308d7fe546636%7Cba5a7f39e3be4ab3b45067fa80faecad%7C0%7C0%7C637257510754187992&amp;sdata=GtJ3R8cWlKoU7Pb7aEinUP8nsFtH6hwCvvrp29nA4sU%3D&amp;reserved=0">Commencement 2020 Graduating Student Committee</a>—as well as the input of several campus partners—with the goal of providing special festivities that are wholly unique to your class and separate from the programming for the Class of 2021. We also considered factors such as hotel room and restaurant availability, as well as event timing for our peer institutions in Nashville. I know that Incoming Chancellor Diermeier shares my excitement about these celebrations, and I’m sure you all are eager to reunite with your classmates, families, mentors and professors on campus.</p>
<p>I encourage you all to visit the <a href="https://nam04.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Ft.e2ma.net%2Fclick%2Fhposzd%2Fxxtu8z%2Fxdq6feb&amp;data=02%7C01%7Ckate.derrick%40vanderbilt.edu%7C58a71b6cb25948304ee308d7fe546636%7Cba5a7f39e3be4ab3b45067fa80faecad%7C0%7C0%7C637257510754187992&amp;sdata=98g%2BNWwrlsyfpHdZJG1wKRYx6A3Af5ZdvrBvaF1FcrE%3D&amp;reserved=0">Commencement website</a> for updates and information as our planning continues to progress. You can also reach out to your fellow graduates on the committee with additional thoughts, or fill out the <a href="https://nam04.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Ft.e2ma.net%2Fclick%2Fhposzd%2Fxxtu8z%2Fd6q6feb&amp;data=02%7C01%7Ckate.derrick%40vanderbilt.edu%7C58a71b6cb25948304ee308d7fe546636%7Cba5a7f39e3be4ab3b45067fa80faecad%7C0%7C0%7C637257510754197990&amp;sdata=WldCXEUgQIWixrZEdYBASN3ZlML07bHLsP7FRB5D%2Bnc%3D&amp;reserved=0">online feedback form</a>.</p>
<p>Over the next few weeks, each of our graduates will receive a special package from Vanderbilt containing commemorative items, such as a champagne flute. In June, we will hold a virtual toast for the Class of 2020, which will include some other familiar faces from our campus who share the desire to celebrate your achievements. We will provide more details about this event soon.</p>
<p>A hard copy of your diploma is also on its way to you. I hope you have had a chance to view the certified electronic version of your diploma, which was sent out via email from the Office of the University Registrar earlier this week. <a href="https://nam04.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Ft.e2ma.net%2Fclick%2Fhposzd%2Fxxtu8z%2Ftyr6feb&amp;data=02%7C01%7Ckate.derrick%40vanderbilt.edu%7C58a71b6cb25948304ee308d7fe546636%7Cba5a7f39e3be4ab3b45067fa80faecad%7C0%7C0%7C637257510754197990&amp;sdata=wWC5lyyivaHxI2PoWImYTM0GXAWCEV9zzN5bgLYXFjI%3D&amp;reserved=0">You can reach out to the registrar’s office</a> with any questions about accessing your electronic diploma.</p>
<p>I look forward to celebrating with you next spring. In the meantime, I hope to hear how all of you are doing in your endeavors over the coming months. As you have heard me say before, this is just the beginning of your time as Commodores and as members for life of the Vanderbilt community. I hope you are excited for all that is to come.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Susan R. Wente<br />
Interim Chancellor and Provost<br />
Vanderbilt University</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>While Nashville will enter the second phase of its <a href="https://www.nashville.gov/Portals/0/SiteContent/MayorsOffice/docs/news/Cooper/RoadmapForReopeningGrid.pdf">Roadmap for Reopening</a> beginning Monday, May 25, Vanderbilt University will continue to follow its own <a href="https://www.vanderbilt.edu/coronavirus/campus-return/">Return to Campus Plan</a>, which is currently in Vanderbilt Phase 1.</p>
<p>The Return to Campus Plan is tailored to Vanderbilt’s own unique density, operations and other considerations as a residential education institution. The first phase of the Return to Campus Plan began Monday, May 18, and operations that have begun resuming during this phase are on-campus research activities that cannot be conducted remotely.</p>
<p>The university will continue to ramp up various operations in orderly, sequential phases and will communicate with the Vanderbilt community in advance of each phase.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.vanderbilt.edu/coronavirus/campus-return/"><strong>The Return to Campus Plan can be viewed on the university’s COVID-19 website. &gt;&gt;</strong></a></p>
<p>The following steps and precautions remain in place on the Vanderbilt campus during the university’s Phase 1:<br />
• All staff will continue to work remotely for the foreseeable future unless required to be on campus at the explicit request of their manager.<br />
• All faculty will continue to work remotely for the foreseeable future unless authorized to be on campus by their dean.<br />
• Only residential faculty and a limited number of students with explicit approval are currently residing on campus.<br />
• Buildings are open only to Vanderbilt community members with appropriate access.<br />
• Physical distancing of at least 6 feet between individuals remains in place in all campus spaces, indoor and outdoor.<br />
• Face masks are required in all indoor and outdoor public spaces.<br />
• All those on campus must abide by university social distancing and mask protocols, including any contractors or visitors.<br />
• No events or gatherings may be held on campus.<br />
• The Phase 1 protocols also include density limits in all workspaces and building areas, monitoring and reporting symptoms of illness and other safety precautions.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dear Vanderbilt students and families,</p>
<p>Wherever this note finds you, I hope that you are doing well. At times like these, our Vanderbilt values of open inquiry, equality, compassion and excellence in all endeavors are more important than ever. Please know that I am thinking about all of our undergraduate community, including our newest members, the incoming Class of 2024.</p>
<p>I am writing to share our priorities and hopes for our new and returning students as we continue in-depth planning for the fall semester.</p>
<p>Together, we must acknowledge that many unknowns remain at this moment. However, I assure you that, as we move forward, we will always be guided by two commitments—offering an excellent education to each and every Vanderbilt student and providing to the best extent possible for the health and well-being of everyone in our campus community. Our goal is to resume on-campus, in-person teaching as soon as possible, based on public health status and safety protocols.</p>
<p>We are incredibly fortunate to have our close partnership with Vanderbilt University Medical Center to guide these efforts. VUMC is home to some of the nation’s and the world’s foremost experts in coronaviruses, pulmonary care, vaccine development and public health modeling, and VUMC’s Dr. Alex Jahangir is chair of Nashville’s Coronavirus Task Force. These Vanderbilt experts are leading the way on antiviral and antibody research and treatments, and their guidance is at the center of our planning with regard to the measures that must be taken to help slow the spread of COVID-19.</p>
<p>With robust planning and action, I sincerely hope that we will soon be able to reconnect in classrooms and across our residential living-learning community. Because of the ever-changing nature of the COVID-19 pandemic, a definitive decision or timeframe cannot be announced at this precise moment. However, <strong>Incoming Chancellor Daniel Diermeier and I will communicate with you as soon as we have reached a firm decision on updates regarding all aspects of the fall semester at Vanderbilt</strong>.</p>
<p>As some of you learned during our <a href="https://news.vanderbilt.edu/2020/05/15/wente-kopstain-discuss-return-to-campus-plan-at-virtual-town-hall/">first virtual town hall</a> last Wednesday, Vanderbilt has created a strategic <a href="https://www.vanderbilt.edu/coronavirus/campus-return/">Return to Campus Plan</a> to ensure that we return to campus in a thoughtful and measured way that will also<strong> uphold our mission of learning, research and discovery. </strong></p>
<p>Throughout the Vanderbilt Return to Campus Plan, we prioritize the ramp-up of activities that support this mission, including on-campus education, research and residential living and learning. It is no coincidence that our undergraduate students are at the heart of these mission-driven activities; you are central to our pre-eminence as a leading research university. Supporting you—academically, socially and emotionally—drives everything we do. Both Incoming Chancellor Diermeier and I understand how eager you all are to be together on campus. <strong>We are working tirelessly to achieve that goal and to find new ways to enrich your Vanderbilt experience. </strong></p>
<p>We have been working on several new programs and resources with you in mind.</p>
<ul>
<li>To resume on-campus activities, we are actively developing <a href="https://www.vanderbilt.edu/coronavirus/campus-return/">protocols</a> for COVID-19 testing, contact tracing, positive case and symptom management and other health-based protective measures. In the best-case scenario of holding in-person classes for the fall, we anticipate that physical distancing, face masks/coverings and other health protocols will be necessary. We will be asking for all members of our community to partner in adopting these protocols, as well as others that may prove necessary. We also are currently assessing all of our campus spaces to make sure that classes and other activities can be held in locations that support recommendations from our public health experts. In addition, we are developing comprehensive signage and circulation systems to enable safe distancing across our campus pathways and outdoor spaces.</li>
<li>Launching this summer, our <a href="https://news.vanderbilt.edu/2020/04/27/campus-connection-program-to-enhance-undergraduate-experience/">Campus Connection Program</a> will provide all undergraduate students with personalized guidance for campus services and experiential learning. Professional staff members, overseen by Vice Provost for Academic Affairs and Dean of Residential Faculty Vanessa Beasley, will serve as student “connectors” and will work in addition to academic advisers to provide students with resources and opportunities to reach their goals while at Vanderbilt.</li>
<li>We also are providing support through our <a href="https://www.vanderbilt.edu/coronavirus/resources/">mental health and wellness resources</a>. In addition to virtual and phone counseling sessions through the <a href="https://www.vanderbilt.edu/ucc/">University Counseling Center</a>, Vanderbilt students have access to digital services such as <a href="https://www.vanderbilt.edu/studentcarenetwork/your-resources/self-help-tools/">SilverCloud and the WellTrack app</a>.</li>
<li>Finally, we are carefully assessing Vanderbilt’s on-campus residences and our strategies for supporting student life. <strong>We will be in touch soon with a request for your thoughts and feedback as we clarify the different options surrounding this important topic.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>All of these efforts strengthen my confidence that we will be ready for a variety of scenarios for the fall semester. Importantly, although start dates, end dates and breaks may be different, we are dedicated to providing a <strong>15-week academic calendar for all undergraduate degree programs</strong>, which I know is very important to our students. We are committed to providing a complete and Vanderbilt-quality education across any scenario and despite these unusual circumstances.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://news.vanderbilt.edu/2020/05/08/message-to-class-of-2020/">my video message to the Class of 2020</a>, I shared a speech given by Vanderbilt Chancellor James Kirkland to open the 1930–31 school year, amid the hardship of depression and drought. Chancellor Kirkland reassured students that “completing the educational process is the most permanent investment I know of.” Though our fall semester will look very different from any other time in our history, what won’t change is the rigor, excellence and collegial spirit that mark and have always marked the Vanderbilt experience. The experiences, and the intelligence, aspirations and creativity that you bring to our community are more important than ever.</p>
<p>Over the next weeks and summer months, I hope you will continue to stay engaged and connected. We have several extensive and frequently updated online resources, including our <a href="https://www.vanderbilt.edu/coronavirus/faq/">Coronavirus FAQ pages</a> and the new <a href="https://www.vanderbilt.edu/coronavirus/campus-return/">Return to Campus website</a>. And, we are eager to hear from you. I encourage you to <a href="https://www.vanderbilt.edu/coronavirus/questions/">submit questions and suggestions</a> through the Vanderbilt Coronavirus FAQ website at any time.</p>
<p>Thank you again for your continued patience, flexibility and partnership as we navigate these unprecedented challenges. I look forward to being in touch again soon.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Susan R. Wente</p>
<p>Interim Chancellor and Provost</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Dear prospective fall study abroad students,</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I write to inform you that Vanderbilt has made the difficult decision to <b>suspend participation in all Global Education Office study abroad programs for Fall 2020.</b> Many factors make study abroad challenging at this time, including not only the logistics of travel between countries but also the difficulty of predicting specifics of the health and safety situation for our students. Given the pandemic and ongoing need for measures including quarantines and social distancing, we are also mindful that study abroad experiences in the coming months likely would not look like the study abroad you’ve imagined. Many of our partners have already announced fall cancellations, and we expect more to do so in the coming days and weeks.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Vanderbilt has made this decision at this time to ensure that students have time to plan for the fall semester. In particular, it is important that students be able to arrange their plans for academics and for housing.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I know that most of you have registered for courses at Vanderbilt in the fall, and have remained registered even as you were making plans to study abroad. <b>If you are not currently registered for fall classes at Vanderbilt, or if you need to change your registration in light of the suspension of fall study abroad</b>, there will be a special registration period May 21–22 for fall study abroad students. The University Registrar will reach out to you with more information.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">If you have not yet registered for the housing assignment process, or have questions about housing, please contact <a href="mailto:ohare@vanderbilt.edu"><span class="s2">ohare@vanderbilt.edu</span></a>.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We hope that you may still have the opportunity to study abroad while you’re at Vanderbilt! If you would like to <b>defer your application to study in Spring 2021</b>, please let your GEO advisor know.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Our partners have generally waived their deposit requirements, but if you have incurred a non-refundable deposit, please contact your GEO advisor as soon as possible to discuss next steps.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">All of us at the Global Education Office are saddened that you won’t have the opportunity to study abroad this fall. We believe strongly in the personal and educational value of study abroad, and want to do everything we can to support you in your planning. Please contact your GEO advisor with any questions you have.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Arik Ohnstad<br />
Director<br />
Global Education Office</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dear Vanderbilt Student,</p>
<p>You are receiving this message because we have identified that you have items that were moved to campus storage as we made your residence hall available to VUMC staff. We understand that some of you are anxious to retrieve your belongings, and we have a plan and procedures that will allow students to return to campus to pick up items in a safe and orderly manner.  Our priority is the health and safety of our students, families, and staff; please read this email closely to understand the guidelines for retrieving your items.</p>
<p>Please complete the <strong>“Request to Remove Belongings”</strong> survey in the <a href="https://nam04.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fvanderbilt.datacenter.adirondacksolutions.com%2FVANDERBILT_THDSS_PROD%2Findex.cfm&amp;data=02%7C01%7Cpaige.farst%40vanderbilt.edu%7C0eb162f75f154861ba0308d7f784ba52%7Cba5a7f39e3be4ab3b45067fa80faecad%7C0%7C0%7C637250021741768447&amp;sdata=fzF26h8D1hRdzM%2BajusQYgz2MXdn%2F9uxI0TT7cdtuZM%3D&amp;reserved=0">Student Housing Portal</a> under the Applications menu to let us know what your plans are for your belongings.  <strong>You must respond to this survey no later than 12PM CST, Monday, May 18.</strong> <strong>Failure to respond to the survey will result in your items staying in campus storage.</strong></p>
<p>The survey will have two mutually exclusive options. You must only select one; given the large number of students who have items remaining on campus, we cannot accommodate special requests.</p>
<ol>
<li>I will return to campus on my selected date to get my items.</li>
<li>I want to leave my items in campus storage until on-campus classes resume.</li>
</ol>
<p>Below is additional information on retrieval options listed above:</p>
<h4><strong>Return to Campus</strong></h4>
<p>If you plan to <strong>return to campus</strong> to get your items, you will be given nine dates to choose from to schedule a time to return.  You will have a four-hour move out window on your selected date to remove your items from our storage facility.  <strong>Prepare to take all of your belongings with you at the time of the visit</strong>.  We will not have donation bins.</p>
<p>We will send a follow-up message before your selected time, providing you with specific and detailed instructions about where and how to pick up your belongings.</p>
<p>As a reminder, individuals that return to campus are responsible for assessing personal risk and taking precautions.  We ask that you please bring and wear your own protective gear (facemasks/coverings, gloves).</p>
<p>Individuals who are exhibiting COVID-19 related symptoms should not return to campus.  Please refer to the following link for more information regarding monitoring <a href="https://nam04.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.vanderbilt.edu%2Fcoronavirus%2Fcampus-return%2Fpeople-based-protocols%2F%23symptom-monitoring&amp;data=02%7C01%7Cpaige.farst%40vanderbilt.edu%7C8a2a0b4aba044a755a6808d7f781126f%7Cba5a7f39e3be4ab3b45067fa80faecad%7C0%7C0%7C637250006043683302&amp;sdata=506oK%2B3O%2FBzQ%2FUZ71Cp6mZrGi%2B28JtOJZlKHAnozMzo%3D&amp;reserved=0">COVID-19 </a> related symptoms.</p>
<h4><strong>Continue to use Campus Storage</strong></h4>
<p>If you plan to <strong>continue to</strong> <strong>use campus storage</strong>, your items can be retrieved when on-campus classes resume.  The storage facility is on campus and is climate controlled. There is no fee for campus storage.</p>
<p>Please keep in mind that should there be a surge in COVID-19 cases in Nashville, any new orders issued by the Mayor may result in a pause to this belongings retrieval plan. We ask for your cooperation and flexibility, as this situation is ever evolving.</p>
<p>All students receiving this message should respond to the survey no later than <strong>12PM CST, Monday, May 18.</strong>  If you have any questions feel free to reach out to us.</p>
<p>We are grateful for your patience during this public health crisis.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dear faculty colleagues,</p>
<p>In the typical cycle of our academic calendar, the end of the annual Commencement week celebrations marks a pivot point for many of our efforts—moving from reflection on the prior year to strategic planning and visioning for the next academic year and sessions. The upheavals of the COVID-19 pandemic mean that planning for the 2020-21 academic year has even greater importance. We know we ask much of our faculty during a typical academic year, and this spring you rose to meet the challenges created by the pandemic through transitioning to working remotely and teaching through virtual/alternative learning platforms. You have our utmost respect and gratitude for your efforts. And now, we must continue to work together to ensure ongoing excellence in our teaching and research and a further commitment to the university’s mission.</p>
<p>As you know, in-person classes remain suspended for the summer sessions, and all teaching continues to be conducted through virtual/alternative strategies. However, Vanderbilt will be moving on May 18 into Phase 1 of our <a href="https://www.vanderbilt.edu/coronavirus/campus-return/">Return to Campus plan</a>, which allows dean-authorized graduate and professional student field-based training/learning (as informed by on-campus research activities ramping up and/or clinic/occupational site consent).</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.vanderbilt.edu/coronavirus/campus-return/">Vanderbilt Return to Campus plan</a> and all related decisions are being shaped by the work of multiple committees—at the university level and school/college level—as well as by guidance provided by public health experts, the CDC, and local, state and federal policies. We also appreciate your input into this critical process.</p>
<p>Our goal for the fall semester is to restart on-campus, in-person teaching as soon as possible based on public health status and safety protocols. The Vanderbilt Return to Campus plan indicates that we should be ready for on-campus instruction and/or enhanced virtual/alternative instruction platforms in Phase 3 (note that Phase 3 of the Vanderbilt plan is distinct from Phase 3 of the Nashville plan). A definitive decision cannot be made today, nearly three months before the beginning of the current fall calendars, because of the ever-changing COVID-19 situation. However,<b> we are optimistic that we will be ready for any of a variety of scenarios. To do so, the following framework will support our actions and planning for the fall:</b></p>
<p><b>1) Our goal is to hold in-person classes; </b>however, we anticipate physical distancing measures will be required in all campus spaces, including classrooms. A full assessment of all of our building spaces is being conducted with Vice Chancellor Eric Kopstain’s team, and this information will be used by schools/colleges in designing their curricula.</p>
<p><b>2) Although we are making plans to offer in-person instruction, we need to plan for all courses to be delivered by virtual/alternative platforms.</b> This approach is not just to provide flexibility. It is also necessary because innovations may be needed due to physical distancing requirements within classrooms and to provide accommodations for some students and faculty. Three student populations may need curriculum provided synchronously and/or asynchronously through a virtual/alternative platform: 1) those who cannot return to campus because of travel restrictions; 2) those with health risks; and 3) those in self-isolation or quarantine due to COVID-19 exposure or testing positive. We also will have faculty who seek accommodations to teach via virtual/alternative platforms.</p>
<p><b>3) We have and are deploying additional resources to support further development of virtual/alternative platforms.</b> Vice Provost Tracey George is spearheading these efforts in collaboration with each school/college, the Center for Teaching and VUIT. This includes the Online Course Development Institute workshops, expanded video studio facilities and classroom technology, and additional instructional design support.</p>
<p><b>4) We are committed to planning for a 15-week academic calendar for all undergraduate degree programs and the Graduate School; </b>however, we are considering several options regarding start dates, end dates and breaks across all of our schools/colleges. There will not be a one-size-fits-all approach to our solutions for providing excellence in our 2020-21 academic year.</p>
<p><b>5) While we are working closely together on these issues as a university community, we recognize and value that curricular decisions are local, and that teaching norms and expectations vary across disciplines and schools/colleges.</b></p>
<p>Our fall semester will look very different from any time in our history, but we will be prepared, innovative and nimble.</p>
<p>We want our faculty to be proud of our strategy and confident in their plans. We want our students to find academic success and engagement at a level consistent with the excellence that is Vanderbilt’s hallmark and to know their experience provides opportunities for the growth and learning that they need to be successful. Finally, we want our staff to know that their role continues to support our mission and that their well-being, along with that of our faculty and students, is top of mind.</p>
<p>We hope you will be able to attend the virtual town hall meeting tomorrow to discuss the phased reopening of the Vanderbilt campus. The online meeting via Zoom will begin at noon CT, and registration is required to attend. (<a href="https://vanderbilt.zoom.us/webinar/register/8415892234418/WN_gXawtncyQ9Ssg7-QyxphPg">Register for the May 13 virtual town hall.</a>)</p>
<p>We know it is daunting to consider navigating times like these, and to continue putting forth such tremendous efforts in preparing for the fall. Please let us know your questions and needs as we work together.</p>
<p>Thank you for your dedication to ensuring we remain the best community and university that we can be.</p>

Our <a href="https://nam04.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Ft.e2ma.net%2Fclick%2Fxlg0yd%2Fhl52rfb%2Fpncc8db&amp;data=02%7C01%7Ckatherine.s.keith%40vanderbilt.edu%7Cfdcf6b1757704b524b0a08d7f3952436%7Cba5a7f39e3be4ab3b45067fa80faecad%7C0%7C0%7C637245694196276987&amp;sdata=alfDBd6qaMf4IZQDywS9rAn36nsqH4ZKdmwIs40cgq0%3D&amp;reserved=0"><span class="s2"><b>multi-phase research ramp-up matrix</b></span></a> details the different phases that will guide us through the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic. These phases are aligned with the university’s overall strategy for resuming campus operations.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">As with the plans set forth by our peer leading research AAU institutions and VUMC, our ramp-up plan reflects a metrics-based approach that will equitably support all forms of research. Our plan also accounts for the fluctuating nature of the pandemic, as COVID-19 infection rates may continue to wax and wane. It is also worth noting that, in order to protect the safety of our community, all work that can be conducted remotely will continue to stay off campus. Further details will be available in the Return to Campus Plan, which will be posted on Monday, May 11.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I encourage you to review the matrix in its entirety. For your more immediate reference, I am also including an overview of the initial phases below:</span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><b></b><span class="s1"><b>Today on May 8th, we are currently in Phase 0, with less than 5% maximum occupancy</b> for on-campus research activities. We consider this a pre-phase to the 4-Phase Research Ramp-up Plan.</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">During the coming weeks, we will move into <b>Phase I, with up to 33% maximum occupancy</b> for on-campus research spaces. This transition will require a reconfiguration of spaces to enable appropriate distancing, as well as the implementation of scheduling protocols, such as working in shifts. No undergraduate students will be permitted to participate in on-campus research during this time.</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">While we anticipate that our researchers will be able to work productively during Phase I, the shift from Phase 0 to Phase I will require a gradual progression as faculty and staff work together to carefully prepare and implement precautions to mitigate risks of COVID-19.</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>We are planning for specific on-campus operations to begin as early as May 18 as part of Phase I.</b> If you have research activities that need to be brought back to campus around this time, or shortly thereafter, we encourage you to begin preparing now.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It is also important to note that the process for resuming essential on-campus research activities will be managed largely within individual schools and colleges. As such, please bear in mind the following <b>processes and considerations:</b></span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Each faculty lead, research director or their designee (e.g., lab manager) should complete a <a href="https://nam04.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Ft.e2ma.net%2Fclick%2Fxlg0yd%2Fhl52rfb%2F5fdc8db&amp;data=02%7C01%7Ckatherine.s.keith%40vanderbilt.edu%7Cfdcf6b1757704b524b0a08d7f3952436%7Cba5a7f39e3be4ab3b45067fa80faecad%7C0%7C0%7C637245694196276987&amp;sdata=lJyXUpxGDddTDnS2HkgD%2FMekoIv1b3zc%2FL5ftbqLxC8%3D&amp;reserved=0"><span class="s2"><b>Research Ramp-up Intake Form</b></span></a> outlining plans for a safe return to specific research activities. These should be submitted to supervisory entity, typically the associate dean for research, if applicable, or the respective dean.</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Supervisory entities will review intake forms, and notify of approval, including any necessary revisions to the proposed plans including the return-to-campus start date.</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">We expect that the majority of reviews and approvals will be conducted at the school or college level. However, in cases where there is significant cross-college activity or VUMC collaboration, additional coordination through the Vice Provost for Research office may be needed.</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In making approval decisions, deans and other supervisors will consider the following factors among others:  How well the proposed plans address necessary safety measures, the extent to which different fields and types of on-campus research activities are given the opportunity to begin research in Phase I, and the relevance of the proposed research activity to COVID-19, if appropriate.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Prior to embarking on the processes outlined above, I encourage you to review the current resources we have prepared to help with this transition that are posted to the <strong><a href="https://research.vanderbilt.edu/">Research website</a></strong>. These resources will continue to be updated as new information becomes available. I encourage you to routinely review this information. These include:</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I know that there are many complexities inherent in this process, but I am confident that these reopening steps for Phase 1 are appropriate and allow us to continue to making discoveries that have a positive impact on our society, in a safe and measured way. <b>As Interim Chancellor and Provost Wente said in her message, resuming on-campus research and other activities will require the complete and constant commitment of every member of our community to following our campus operating protocols.</b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I am deeply grateful to everyone who collaborated in creating this plan, including Vanderbilt’s associate deans for research, the dean of the Graduate School, the Office of the General Counsel and Vanderbilt University Environmental Health and Safety, and generous support from Vice Chancellor for Administration Eric Kopstain.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In many ways, COVID-19 is as real and present today as it was when we first made the difficult decisions to suspend in-person classes, research activities and campus operations in early March. For that reason, a full return to on-campus research cannot happen overnight. We are taking this next step to ramp up on campus research activities that cannot be performed remotely. As researchers, you have always approached experimentation and learning with a deep sense of responsibility to the safety of not only yourself but of your colleagues, students and our campus community.  It is our culture of responsibility not only to ourselves but towards others that is at the heart of these plans.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In the coming weeks, continued collaboration and honest dialogue will be critical as we continue to further refine these plans based on input from our research community as well as advisory groups such as the <a href="https://nam04.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Ft.e2ma.net%2Fclick%2Fxlg0yd%2Fhl52rfb%2F9yic8db&amp;data=02%7C01%7Ckatherine.s.keith%40vanderbilt.edu%7Cfdcf6b1757704b524b0a08d7f3952436%7Cba5a7f39e3be4ab3b45067fa80faecad%7C0%7C0%7C637245694196316972&amp;sdata=h%2B1Tz16BGOfdq5tKpsWdliCnKw8Q6PWeikcNxEk1eC0%3D&amp;reserved=0"><span class="s2"><b>Vanderbilt University Research Council</b></span></a>, the <a href="https://nam04.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Ft.e2ma.net%2Fclick%2Fxlg0yd%2Fhl52rfb%2Fprjc8db&amp;data=02%7C01%7Ckatherine.s.keith%40vanderbilt.edu%7Cfdcf6b1757704b524b0a08d7f3952436%7Cba5a7f39e3be4ab3b45067fa80faecad%7C0%7C0%7C637245694196326968&amp;sdata=oq5EHosgGKMaT%2FTHe1L7NOVT44PT0vklkQ%2FZMe7kaMc%3D&amp;reserved=0"><span class="s2"><b>Public Health Advisory Task Force</b></span></a> and the <a href="https://nam04.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Ft.e2ma.net%2Fclick%2Fxlg0yd%2Fhl52rfb%2F5jkc8db&amp;data=02%7C01%7Ckatherine.s.keith%40vanderbilt.edu%7Cfdcf6b1757704b524b0a08d7f3952436%7Cba5a7f39e3be4ab3b45067fa80faecad%7C0%7C0%7C637245694196336961&amp;sdata=hccLCMqfM48l9KYUY6yRESBLf4vbp1dwW7lOLIruvtM%3D&amp;reserved=0"><span class="s2"><b>University Continuity Working Groups</b></span></a>, among others.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Dear Vanderbilt community,</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Today Mayor John Cooper announced that on Monday, May 11, Nashville will begin Phase 1 in his <a href="https://nam04.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Ft.e2ma.net%2Fclick%2Fx1oxyd%2Fhl52rfb%2F5ram7db&amp;data=02%7C01%7Ckatherine.s.keith%40vanderbilt.edu%7Cf20d86e6d2f647420d7908d7f2dacd6b%7Cba5a7f39e3be4ab3b45067fa80faecad%7C0%7C0%7C637244893912212949&amp;sdata=YsUrnACzZzRDdEgh0V6FJLhOdlipZXmydoWP008Hd8Y%3D&amp;reserved=0"><span class="s2"><b>Roadmap for Reopening Nashville</b></span></a>. I encourage all of you, particularly those who are residents of Nashville, to read and familiarize yourselves with the city’s Phase 1 plans. Most importantly, I want you to know that the university will be implementing its own framework for reopening.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The reopening of universities, including Vanderbilt, is not specifically noted in the Nashville plan. That is because universities, like ours, cannot easily be defined by a single function. We are complex operational entities—almost like a city unto ourselves and home to many different functions. We are an event site; our dining facilities are like restaurants; our in-person classes could be considered akin to K-12 schools; and so much more. And we know that as a residential university, we have unique needs.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Over the past weeks, multiple committees, working groups and task forces have been working on the Vanderbilt University “Return to Campus Plan.” The plan is guided by our unique circumstances, and, like the Nashville plan, it considers public health status and operating guidance from the federal government, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Tennessee Department of Public Health and Vanderbilt University Medical Center. Incoming Chancellor Daniel Diermeier and I have been coordinating closely throughout this process working with the Board of Trust Ad Hoc Committee on University COVID-19 Response. We will ramp up our various operations in orderly, sequential phases that keep our core mission of teaching and research at the center of our efforts.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Our own Vanderbilt University Phase 1 resumption of specific, limited, on-campus operations and activities will begin May 18 and will be tailored to our own unique density, operations and other considerations as a residential education institution. </b>Phasing in increasing levels of on-campus activity will enable us to test and practice rigorous Vanderbilt University protocols in an orderly manner that will enhance the safety of the Vanderbilt and larger Nashville communities.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Right now, I want all to be aware that <b>the following steps and precautions remain in place on the Vanderbilt campus now and during the university’s Phase 1:</b></span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">All staff will continue to work remotely for the foreseeable future unless required to be on campus at the explicit request of their manager.</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">All faculty will continue to work remotely for the foreseeable future unless authorized to be on campus by their dean.</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Only residential faculty and a limited number of students with explicit approval are currently living on campus.</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Buildings are open only to Vanderbilt community members with appropriate access.</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Physical distancing of at least 6 feet between individuals remains in place in all campus spaces, indoor and outdoor.</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Face masks are required in all indoor and outdoor public places.</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">All those on campus must abide by university social distancing and mask protocols, including any contractors or visitors.</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">No events or gatherings may be held on campus.</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The first operations to begin ramping up during the university’s Phase 1 will be on-campus research activities that cannot be conducted remotely. I believe Vanderbilt research is absolutely essential to solving the problems we face as a society, most immediately the COVID-19 pandemic. Our researchers and I want this essential work to resume as soon as possible.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Vice Chancellor Eric Kopstain and Vice Provost Padma Raghavan and committees working with them have laid out the plans for ramping up these specific research activities. The associate deans for research in each school/college are also directly involved in this planning. Faculty will hear directly from Vice Provost Raghavan and the deans about re-opening requirements and protocols in their areas. Specific campuswide policies and protocols for research activities will be posted on Monday, May 11.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We also have developed detailed, <b>rigorous sets of campuswide operating protocols</b> that will be put in place across campus. Some will be across all aspects of the university campus, and others will be specific to unique areas (such as research environments). The Phase 1 protocols will include physical distancing, density limits in all workspaces and building areas, wearing face masks, monitoring and reporting symptoms of illness, event and gathering limitations and other safety precautions. As additional operations resume in a phased manner in the coming months, any additional protocols, or modifications to such protocols, will be updated in real time. The success of our implementation will require everyone’s commitment and cooperation.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Vice Chancellor Eric Kopstain and I will hold a town hall meeting on Wednesday, May 13, at noon on Zoom to share with you the current expected phases for our continued ramp up of campus activities. </b>This town hall will be the first of several and is one way we will be continuing to share information. Details on how to join the call will be shared in <a href="https://nam04.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Ft.e2ma.net%2Fclick%2Fx1oxyd%2Fhl52rfb%2Flkbm7db&amp;data=02%7C01%7Ckatherine.s.keith%40vanderbilt.edu%7Cf20d86e6d2f647420d7908d7f2dacd6b%7Cba5a7f39e3be4ab3b45067fa80faecad%7C0%7C0%7C637244893912212949&amp;sdata=S%2BckRdLjnXMrcCbzrUrn8%2Bh6GpC%2FSf%2FTv4sB9iJX5iA%3D&amp;reserved=0"><span class="s2"><b>MyVU</b></span></a> on Monday, May 11.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We all share the same goal—returning to the beloved community and campus that feed our spirits and minds, and conducting classes in person there this fall. Achieving that goal is up to each one of us. <b>Our ability to sustain and increase our on-campus presence and activities depends on the commitment and cooperation of every member of our community. </b>Vanderbilt University distinguishes itself through a culture of collaboration and a dedication to teaching, research and service. Now, more than ever, we must come together as a community with a shared sense of responsibility.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The COVID-19 pandemic has presented us with tremendous challenges, but, thankfully, this is exactly what we as a university community are prepared to tackle—to ask, to question, to collaborate, to discover, to solve. And, most of all, to do so together.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Sincerely,</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Susan R. Wente</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Interim Chancellor and Provost</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dear colleagues,</p>
<p>The university normally enters a time of transition at this time of year—Commencement on May 8 marks the end of the academic year and begins summer break for many staff who work a partial-year schedule. This is, of course, not a normal year—this week also marked the conclusion of the Voluntary Staff Departure Incentive Program application process, a step that the university took as part of its actions to address the extreme financial challenges created by the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>We know many of you have questions about returning to on-campus work. The university has continued to implement remote work practices as Nashville remains under a Safer at Home order until at least May 8. After Nashville lifts the Safer at Home order, Vanderbilt will resume specific on-campus activities in a strictly phased manner under new protocols dictated by COVID-19.</p>
<p><strong>Unless you are required to be on campus at the explicit request of your manager, you should continue to work remotely beyond May 8. </strong>Because we will continue to need to reduce the density of people and enable physical distancing on campus, remote work is likely to continue for the foreseeable future for most staff whose role and workload enables them to be effective doing so.</p>
<p>However, we are now entering a period where we must make further difficult decisions. Both the COVID-19 crisis and the coincident global economic downturn are resulting in unanticipated revenue losses and increased operational expenses. As a result, activities and staffing levels will be impacted.</p>
<p>The workloads of staff also have changed significantly in ways that are distinct and dependent on their roles since we ramped down different university functions and on-campus operations and activities and moved to online courses for summer. In our current circumstances, in some areas, staff have a full workload and are able to productively work remotely for the foreseeable future. For others, they continue to have a potential full workload, but their work cannot be productively done remotely. Unfortunately, others no longer have a full workload whether working remotely or on campus.</p>
<p>Since March 15, we have continued full pay and benefits for all staff under their typical work schedules, regardless of role and workload.</p>
<p><strong>Beginning May 15, managers will be evaluating the workload of staff, and their ability to work productively from home, alongside their individual school’s or unit’s specific financial constraints. In some cases, this will mean that full pay and benefits for those who cannot work productively from home or for those who have reduced workloads will no longer continue. </strong>Each school and unit will be responsible for determining if additional employment actions are necessary to reflect the financial realities and workloads of staff in their respective areas.</p>
<p>Actions that individual areas may take may include position eliminations (reductions in force), temporary layoffs, adjustments to hours worked and partial-year scheduling. Again, these are not across-the-board changes. <strong>Please be assured that your manager will communicate with you about your own role and any potential impacts. </strong></p>
<p>Though these changes will not impact every area, all staff should be aware that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Positions will be eliminated in certain areas as we transform how we support our mission activities under the current conditions and in the face of the economic impact of the pandemic.</li>
<li>Unit-based, temporary layoffs will be made to enable Vanderbilt to continue to extend benefits to staff who do not have productive work to do before or when we begin ramp-up. Temporary layoffs allow for these employees to be recalled when their services are required.</li>
<li>Schedules and hours will be adjusted to address situations where staff do not have as much productive work to do as a result of changes to operating levels.</li>
<li>Staff who have less-than-normal productive work to accomplish will be required to use Paid Time Off (PTO).</li>
<li>Managers will implement partial-year schedules to structure staff positions in ways that reflect the operating needs of the unit.</li>
</ul>
<p>We encourage you to speak with your manager about any questions and concerns that you may have, and to continue to monitor the <a href="https://nam04.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Ft.e2ma.net%2Fclick%2F9ev8xd%2Fhl52rfb%2Fdqy10db&amp;data=02%7C01%7Ckatherine.s.keith%40vanderbilt.edu%7Ca9a2d5cadbab4bba00fa08d7e88e1d13%7Cba5a7f39e3be4ab3b45067fa80faecad%7C0%7C0%7C637233569382020942&amp;sdata=M3ae6hkN0JX2l8SuDlCSjL5kmlRdJCgV5e2hIOwZfgo%3D&amp;reserved=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>HR information page</strong></a> and the telecommuting and remote work resources on the university’s <a href="https://www.vanderbilt.edu/coronavirus/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>COVID-19 webpage</strong></a>.</p>
<p>Careful and detailed planning is underway for ramping up our most critical campus activities in a safe, phased manner. Prioritized campus activities will include any required on-campus work that directly fulfills Vanderbilt’s research, teaching and instruction, as well as residential living and learning functions. We will have more to share with you soon regarding these plans and the guidelines for anyone who will be returning to on-campus work.</p>
<p>Although this is not a position that any of us wish to be in, we remain committed to providing all of the information that we can to assist you with your planning and expectations for the future. During this unprecedented period of uncertainty, we sincerely appreciate your efforts, dedication and patience.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p><strong>Eric Kopstain</strong><br />
Vice Chancellor for Administration</p>
<p><strong>Laura Nairon</strong><br />
Interim Associate Vice Chancellor for People and Business Services</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dear Campus Residents,</p>
<p>We know many of you are eager to make plans to retrieve your belongings. We are currently finalizing a plan for return visits and will communicate that plan in the coming days.</p>
<p>At this time, the Nashville Mayor has <a href="https://nam04.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tennessean.com%2Fstory%2Fnews%2F2020%2F04%2F30%2Fnashville-extends-coronavirus-safer-home-order-until-least-may-8%2F3055147001%2F&amp;data=02%7C01%7Ckara.furlong%40Vanderbilt.Edu%7C32c2c27a7cf449c4b23208d7ee18b2ee%7Cba5a7f39e3be4ab3b45067fa80faecad%7C0%7C0%7C637239662154954105&amp;sdata=5%2F3VWFsDAkFZN5fivfBvoESh%2BT5Vu5S1GNaLugsqF28%3D&amp;reserved=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">extended the Stay-At-Home order</a> until May 8. While the Governor of Tennessee has permitted some businesses to reopen, a separate task force for Tennessee’s largest cities (including Nashville) was formed to guide their re-openings. Because of Vanderbilt’s location in the heart of Nashville, Vanderbilt is closely monitoring Nashville’s <a href="https://nam04.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.asafenashville.org%2Froadmap-for-reopening-nashville%2F&amp;data=02%7C01%7Ckara.furlong%40Vanderbilt.Edu%7C32c2c27a7cf449c4b23208d7ee18b2ee%7Cba5a7f39e3be4ab3b45067fa80faecad%7C0%7C0%7C637239662154954105&amp;sdata=28xj6oA6Ti6EVv9lIRjIzrgB0%2FlYW5wSfujt8ArckGM%3D&amp;reserved=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">“Roadmap” for Reopening</a>. The safety of our community continues to be our top priority.</p>
<p>We hope to be able to accept return visits in the coming weeks. We will send communication to students when we are able to do so. Please do not request those at this time; the communication will include a survey to select a time to return.</p>
<p>We are grateful for your continued cooperation, collaboration and flexibility during this public health crisis.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dear undergraduate students,</p>
<p>I hope you are all well. I am writing to check in as the spring semester comes to a close and we begin looking towards next fall. While there are still many unknowns at this time regarding what next semester may bring, one thing we do know: We’re fully committed to supporting our students.</p>
<p>One new way we are planning to do just that is through the <a href="https://news.vanderbilt.edu/2020/04/27/campus-connection-program-to-enhance-undergraduate-experience/"><strong>Campus Connection </strong><strong>Program</strong></a>. This new program will provide all undergraduate students with personalized support and guidance in navigating the various experiential learning and campus services that are part of your collegiate career at Vanderbilt. The Office of the Vice Provost for Academic Affairs will begin implementation of the program this summer.</p>
<p>Why are we starting a new program? Simply put, the university wants to offer more support to our undergraduate students in these uncertain times. Every new and returning undergraduate student will be assigned a <strong>Campus Connector</strong>, a professional staff member from one of the offices in my area. He/she/they will be a single point of contact, providing you with support and information, connections to campus resources, and opportunities to reflect on your experiences at Vanderbilt. Collaborating across departments, your Campus Connector will assist you as you navigate your educational journey and work toward your goals from enrollment to graduation.</p>
<p>In July, your Campus Connector will reach out to you with an introduction to the program and its guidelines. Campus Connectors <strong>will not advise</strong> on topics such as academics, extracurriculars, fundraising, or student health and well-being. They will not replace your academic advisers, your financial aid officer, or a counselor. They will provide connections or referrals to those resources, among others. Much like all first-year students have VUceptors, your Campus Connector will provide a bridge to help connect you to the appropriate resource as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>The launch of the Campus Connection Program is the first of many initiatives we plan to roll out in the coming months as we aim to increase communication and support opportunities that are more important now than ever before.</p>
<p>I am very excited about the opportunities this new program will offer us to become even more closely tied to one another as One Vanderbilt. Interacting with you is a big part of my “why,” and I am looking forward to the many ways that my team—your Campus Connectors—will support you in the coming year.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Vanessa B. Beasley<br />
Vice Provost for Academic Affairs and Dean of Residential Faculty</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Dear colleagues,</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">As the end of April rapidly approaches, and as we begin to look ahead to our next chapter as a university, we write to update you on next steps regarding potential changes to the “stay at home” orders for our Vanderbilt community.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Many questions remain, however <b>it is possible that Vanderbilt’s first phase of increased campus activity will begin as early as Monday, May 11</b>. With this milestone in mind, <b>we are extending “stay at home” orders and authorizations for remote work until Friday, May 8</b>.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">If you have not had the opportunity to read <a href="https://nam04.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Ft.e2ma.net%2Fclick%2F9ev8xd%2Fhl52rfb%2F1cw10db&amp;data=02%7C01%7Ckatherine.s.keith%40vanderbilt.edu%7Ca9a2d5cadbab4bba00fa08d7e88e1d13%7Cba5a7f39e3be4ab3b45067fa80faecad%7C0%7C0%7C637233569382010950&amp;sdata=gUpNj1NYHZeKiFIC1B9coLFhr3yIAYzax1gf3XvvC%2FU%3D&amp;reserved=0"><span class="s2"><b>Interim Chancellor Wente’s message about the economic impact of COVID-19</b></span></a>, we highly encourage you to take a few minutes to do so. That message, and the follow-up message sent to you from your dean, vice chancellor or vice provost, outline the stark realities of the financial challenges the university is facing as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as the difficult actions we will need to take now and over the next couple of years to manage through these tough economic conditions.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In her message, Interim Chancellor Wente describes our new <b>Voluntary Staff Departure Incentive Program</b>, which we have introduced as part of our workplace planning. <a href="https://nam04.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Ft.e2ma.net%2Fclick%2F9ev8xd%2Fhl52rfb%2Fh5w10db&amp;data=02%7C01%7Ckatherine.s.keith%40vanderbilt.edu%7Ca9a2d5cadbab4bba00fa08d7e88e1d13%7Cba5a7f39e3be4ab3b45067fa80faecad%7C0%7C0%7C637233569382020942&amp;sdata=6Rx3Y%2FtCZK7IcOfWH%2BMTEtAIn5A7a%2FBrGPL2bNf%2FdU0%3D&amp;reserved=0"><span class="s2"><b>You can read more about this program here</b></span></a>.

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Any additional staffing changes and reorganizations related to operational changes and/or current and future economic conditions will be managed by individual schools, colleges, and units. You will hear from leadership and managers across Vanderbilt’s different schools and units regarding operations, timelines, personnel changes and other specific considerations.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Vanderbilt’s strategy for returning to more standard levels of campus operations will continue to follow a phased and data-driven approach. These phases are based on Vanderbilt’s unique operational and personnel requirements as a university, while also taking into account the city of <a href="https://nam04.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Ft.e2ma.net%2Fclick%2F9ev8xd%2Fhl52rfb%2Fxxx10db&amp;data=02%7C01%7Ckatherine.s.keith%40vanderbilt.edu%7Ca9a2d5cadbab4bba00fa08d7e88e1d13%7Cba5a7f39e3be4ab3b45067fa80faecad%7C0%7C0%7C637233569382020942&amp;sdata=a1lS3iugo%2BHwDfna0g5l%2FG4%2FhIrJE1DOg7A9xQXJfMk%3D&amp;reserved=0"><span class="s2"><b>Nashville’s overall roadmap for reopening</b></span></a>.  When we begin the partial and phased return to campus and some campus activities, <b>explicit directions about the date and protocols will come from your manager</b>. All will have the opportunity to address any unique circumstances with their manager prior to their return.   </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">As we move forward, your continuing flexibility will be critical. We anticipate returning to campus through stages of increasing activity and study of what activities will resume and when, and how they will safely do so. We will continue to carefully evaluate all data, models and public health recommendations and to consider government recommendations. We will also track and reflect the overall progress of the COVID-19 disease response on local and regional levels, and our actions will be based on information that we receive from VUMC and public health experts.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We encourage you to continue to monitor the <a href="https://nam04.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Ft.e2ma.net%2Fclick%2F9ev8xd%2Fhl52rfb%2Fdqy10db&amp;data=02%7C01%7Ckatherine.s.keith%40vanderbilt.edu%7Ca9a2d5cadbab4bba00fa08d7e88e1d13%7Cba5a7f39e3be4ab3b45067fa80faecad%7C0%7C0%7C637233569382020942&amp;sdata=M3ae6hkN0JX2l8SuDlCSjL5kmlRdJCgV5e2hIOwZfgo%3D&amp;reserved=0"><span class="s2"><b>HR information page</b></span></a> and the telecommuting and remote work resources on the university’s <a href="https://nam04.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Ft.e2ma.net%2Fclick%2F9ev8xd%2Fhl52rfb%2Ftiz10db&amp;data=02%7C01%7Ckatherine.s.keith%40vanderbilt.edu%7Ca9a2d5cadbab4bba00fa08d7e88e1d13%7Cba5a7f39e3be4ab3b45067fa80faecad%7C0%7C0%7C637233569382030939&amp;sdata=brkyyu0eUCy%2BIrzStmcRwdM4yBSj8YdWy5AKwtxw95c%3D&amp;reserved=0"><span class="s2"><b>COVID-19 webpage</b></span></a> as we move forward.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='750' height='422' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/videoseries?list=PLB1EPeYUwa4kqwUBZKPmzrjxKp1aoKtvm&#038;hl=en_US' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></p>
<p>Dear Vanderbilt colleagues,</p>
<p>This is an incredibly difficult time for all of us, but through it all, I am proud of how our Vanderbilt community has come together to ensure that our education and research mission can continue. Faculty and staff all across Vanderbilt have responded with volumes of outstanding work in response to the COVID-19 crisis.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, we are facing continued challenges on more than one front. First, there is the unprecedented global effort to slow the spread of COVID-19 disease and to keep our most vulnerable protected. Numerous and complex decisions will need to be made in the coming weeks and months to ensure our community remains safe while we simultaneously adapt to ensure continuity of our teaching and research missions. In addition, the necessary actions to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic have created economic challenges for businesses and organizations around the world and across nearly every industry, including higher education and our university.</p>
<p>As we confront this dual health and economic crisis, we must remain steadfast in the constant pursuit of our mission and the ideals outlined in our Academic Strategic Plan. These core commitments are at the front of my mind as we consider scenarios that will ensure the university’s success today and into the future.</p>
<p>To be clear, because of years of careful stewardship, Vanderbilt University is in a strong financial position relative to our peers. This will allow us to take a more proactive and strategic approach to managing through these difficult economic conditions. It enables us to make near-term decisions with the long-term in mind and carefully phase in any needed budget changes to ensure we can advance our mission today and for many years to come, just as we have for the past 147 years.</p>
<p>However, we are not immune to the significant economic impacts. In the current fiscal year, which ends June 30, we anticipate that the negative budget impacts associated with COVID-19 to Vanderbilt University will exceed $30 million. Depending on the length of the pandemic, we could incur significant additional losses in revenue and increases in costs over the next several months.</p>
<p>These pandemic-specific economic impacts will be exacerbated further by extremely challenging global economic conditions, which are likely to impact all of society for the next few years.</p>
<div class="well">
<p>It is nearly certain that the slowdown in national economic activity, sharply rising unemployment levels and overall current economic downturn will affect the university in many ways. Consider the three major funding sources driving Vanderbilt University’s operating budget:</p>
<h3>Tuition</h3>
<p>Tuition across all ten of our schools and colleges provides the largest portion of our operating revenues and is critical to sustaining excellence in our academic mission by supporting our faculty and staff. With the global economic downturn, the need for financial aid is likely to increase over the next few years, and this will then result in less net tuition revenue. Regardless, should we face increased need for student aid, we will hold firm to our mission and values and continue our commitment to Opportunity Vanderbilt and our graduate/professional aid programs.</p>
<h3>The endowment and gifts</h3>
<p>Like all of our peers, Vanderbilt’s endowment has recently lost considerable value due to the sudden international economic crisis. This will result in lower revenue distributions to support our budgets over the next several years. Contrary to the belief by many outside of higher education, we are limited in how we can use endowment funds because our endowment is not one large, flexible pot of money. It comprises nearly 3,000 different funds, with varying legal restrictions and requirements, supporting a wide range of institutional needs and purposes. Complicating matters going forward, our donors’ capacity to support the university – through current-use and endowed giving – will likely be diminished during the economic downturn.</p>
<h3>Grants and contracts</h3>
<p>Funding from grants and contracts also provides a significant portion of our annual operations, and the work supported is fundamental to our core mission of discovery and knowledge. The financial implications for research operations and funding due to COVID-19 disease management and the economic downturn remain unknown, but we will closely monitor potential effects as we plan for both short-term and long-term continuity.</p>
</div>
<p>Going forward, we must hope for the best while planning for all possibilities. With our primary tuition and endowment/gift revenues expected to decrease for multiple years, as outlined above, we will need to adapt our business model and manage our expenditures while also being entrepreneurial. I am confident that our faculty and staff will continue to innovate and to identify and maximize new and emerging revenue sources to support our work and mission.</p>
<p>It is difficult at this point in time to know exactly every step we will need to eventually take to address these complex challenges. For this reason, we are modeling several scenarios, considering such variables as the duration of the pandemic, financial market activity and conditions, other signals of economic health, and trends regarding the higher education choices that students and their families make in response to the global crisis.</p>
<p>Through all of this, I assure you that we are doing our best to take care of our people based on the best information we have at any given time. As you know, we recently extended our remote work period through April 30. Overall, we have preserved staff pay and benefits, regardless of one’s ability to work remotely, for nearly seven weeks.</p>
<div class="well">
<p>In this next phase of financial stewardship, we are taking the following steps to control costs and prepare ourselves for our best assessment of the current and ongoing economic realities:</p>
<ul>
<li>All discretionary spending for the remainder of fiscal year 2020 (which ends June 30, 2020) is suspended;</li>
<li>All staff hiring is restricted and will require enhanced justification and explicit vice chancellor or dean approval;</li>
<li>A <a href="https://hr.vanderbilt.edu/vsdip/">short-term Voluntary Staff Departure Incentive Program</a> is under development and will be launched on April 20, 2020. The existing <a href="https://www.vanderbilt.edu/faculty-affairs/retirement/">assisted early retirement plans for tenured faculty</a> will also remain available;</li>
<li>Annual salary merit increases for upcoming fiscal year 2021 will be deferred until further notice;</li>
<li>A review is underway of all construction and renovation projects to determine which ones should be delayed;</li>
<li>University leaders will continue working together to examine all of our activities and identify opportunities to gain new efficiencies and maximize results through restructuring or other organizational changes; and</li>
<li>University leaders and business officers across the university are working together to develop and submit revised budgets for fiscal year 2021 that reflect a decrease in spending and lower revenue expectations.</li>
</ul>
<p>Based upon current known conditions, there is no plan at this time for across-the-board university layoffs or furloughs. Any potential staffing changes related to current and future economic conditions will continue to be managed by individual schools, colleges and units. All of the steps described above will be implemented with an eye toward achieving overall reductions in total university expenses in the 5-10% range for upcoming fiscal year 2021.</p>
<p>These will be difficult actions for all of us. While solutions will not be one size fits all, all of our decision-making will continue to be grounded in our commitment to trust, transparency and teamwork and guided by several key principles:</p>
<ul>
<li>We will protect and safeguard the health and safety of our community;</li>
<li>We will use the best available methods, research and data to make our decisions; and</li>
<li>Our One Vanderbilt culture of collaboration and commitment to thoughtful deliberation will continue to steer our actions.</li>
</ul>
<p>All of the actions that we take in the weeks and months ahead to respond to these extraordinary circumstances will be focused on ensuring our ability to pursue our mission for generations to come.</p>
</div>
<p>As we develop various scenarios to respond to this economic uncertainty, I will continue to partner closely with our deans and vice chancellors, the <a href="https://news.vanderbilt.edu/2020/03/17/board-of-trust-establishes-ad-hoc-committee-to-support-universitys-coronavirus-response/">Vanderbilt University Board of Trust</a> and Incoming Chancellor Daniel Diermeier. We are all committed to listening closely to the recently established <a href="https://news.vanderbilt.edu/2020/03/23/university-launches-public-health-advisory-task-force-in-response-to-covid-19/">advisory groups</a> of dedicated faculty and staff for input across the range of decisions that must be made.</p>
<p>The extreme uncertainty of these times is unprecedented. While we cannot predict the future and do not have all of the answers today, I am certain of the strength and vitality of our great university and of its promise to not only survive this challenge but to emerge stronger for it. Thank you for your exceptional efforts, your understanding and your commitment to working together.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Susan R. Wente<br />
Interim Chancellor and Provost</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Vanderbilt University will use $2.8 million it receives as part of the federal Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security (CARES) Act to directly support students who have demonstrated need and are facing significant financial challenges due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>The disbursement, from the U.S. Department of Education as part of the CARES Act Higher Education Emergency Relief Fund, is designed to prioritize students with the greatest demonstrated need and ensure that funds are distributed as widely as possible.</p>
<p>“As the coronavirus pandemic continues, the hardships—financial and otherwise—presented by this global crisis continue to be felt deeply and widely by our students, their families and many others in the Vanderbilt community,” Interim Chancellor and Provost Susan R. Wente said. “The well-being and success of our students remain our top priority, and we are committed to doing all that we can to support them during this incredibly challenging time.”</p>
<p>In alignment with Department of Education recommendations, Vanderbilt will distribute the CARES Act funds to federal aid applicants with the greatest identified need, i.e. those with an expected family contribution of $10,000 or less. In addition, each undergraduate recipient must have received financial aid for the spring 2020 semester, and each graduate or professional school recipient must have received federal student loans this spring.</p>
<p>Each eligible student will receive $1,100. Some 20 percent of Vanderbilt’s students—split near-evenly among undergraduates, graduate and professional students—will receive the funds. Vanderbilt will disburse funds to qualifying students through the normal process via Student Accounts in the coming days.</p>
<p>The CARES Act funding is one of a series of ways Vanderbilt is addressing the needs of low-income students during the global COVID-19 public health crisis.</p>
<p>Undergraduate students receiving aid through Opportunity Vanderbilt have received a housing and dining adjustment. All students eligible for Federal Work Study who have submitted their work hours continue to receive their normal pay—regardless of whether they are working or not.</p>
<p>On March 20, the university announced it was providing $1 million to launch a <a href="https://giving.vanderbilt.edu/studenthardshipfund.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Student Hardship Fund</a> to help undergraduate, graduate and professional students with demonstrated need by alleviating financial burdens associated with the unexpected and abrupt changes to their Vanderbilt experience necessitated by the crisis. To date, 1,241 students, including undergraduate, graduate and professional, have received funding from the Student Hardship Fund.</p>
<p>The university’s efforts to assist students who have demonstrated need and are experiencing significant financial challenges are cumulative—meaning students who have previously received housing and dining adjustments and/or Federal Work Study payments may still seek an individual review through Financial Aid, apply for the Student Hardship Fund, and, if eligible, receive an additional $1,100 through the CARES Act disbursement.</p>
<p>Students who have expenses that have not been covered already can appeal for an individual review directly to the Office of Student Financial Aid for additional assistance at <a href="mailto:finaid@vanderbilt.edu" target="_blank" rel="noopener">finaid@vanderbilt.edu</a>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Dear Undergraduate Students,</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I sincerely hope this message finds you healthy and well as you continue your studies remotely. I wanted to share some updates on activity in the residence halls, spaces we know are your homes at Vanderbilt University.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">First, in consultation with the Vanderbilt University Medical Center, the university has decided to use its campus residence halls to provide essential close-proximity housing for medical staff as they work around the clock to fight the global pandemic. Providing this housing option to medical staff on the front lines will allow them to continue their work while protecting their families by limiting their exposure. VUMC is one of the largest academic medical centers serving not only Tennessee but also the mid-South region, and we feel a deep responsibility to serve the community in these uncertain times by being the very best partner we can to our heroic healthcare providers.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Second, this decision has some implications. The most obvious one is that we need to make those spaces ready as soon as possible.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">If you are among the students still residing on campus, you have already been notified that we are in the process of relocation. The purpose of this move is to enhance your safety and security as well as our ability to support you. Remaining students will each be assigned to living spaces with a bathroom and kitchen, a living room, and at least one bedroom. Housekeeping has increased its sanitizing efforts in residential common areas; security posts continue to be staffed; and Campus Dining has established a food distribution site for campus residents.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">If you are not living on campus, you will be asked to make an important choice regarding your belongings still on campus: Vanderbilt can pack, insure, and store your items on campus at no expense to you, or UPS can pack and ship your items at your own expense.  When it is time for your residence hall to be packed, the Office of Housing and Residential Experience (OHARE) will contact you to provide more details and tell you how to indicate your choice. As a reminder, you can also apply to <a href="https://nam04.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Ft.e2ma.net%2Fclick%2F9yi8wd%2Fhl52rfb%2Fpvmprdb&amp;data=02%7C01%7Ckatherine.s.keith%40vanderbilt.edu%7C237471ce0b4d41856cd108d7db42c3c7%7Cba5a7f39e3be4ab3b45067fa80faecad%7C0%7C0%7C637218952108648247&amp;sdata=%2B9qPF%2BT3v4aR9bGzqRkJrKMDOKM9lNAcc8t4VEur7EI%3D&amp;reserved=0"><span class="s2"><b>the university’s Hardship Fund</b></span></a> for possible assistance with shipping.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Third, unfortunately you cannot come back to campus now to do this yourself. Due to Nashville Mayor John Cooper’s <a href="https://nam04.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Ft.e2ma.net%2Fclick%2F9yi8wd%2Fhl52rfb%2F5nnprdb&amp;data=02%7C01%7Ckatherine.s.keith%40vanderbilt.edu%7C237471ce0b4d41856cd108d7db42c3c7%7Cba5a7f39e3be4ab3b45067fa80faecad%7C0%7C0%7C637218952108648247&amp;sdata=HJd4Ax2fdoNfls%2FCFqKoHSqQ35mxFBzPxODl42M%2B7A8%3D&amp;reserved=0"><span class="s2"><b>Safer at Home order</b></span></a>, which is currently in effect, students and/or their family members cannot return to campus at this time to retrieve personal belongings. If and when all travel restrictions and Safer at Home orders are lifted, and we can ensure that it is safe to do so, OHARE will communicate details and provide instructions about when and how to retrieve belongings from campus storage.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In closing, I’d like to share an observation. Inside and outside of the classroom, some of my favorite conversations with students are about complex issues, issues raising questions and revealing needs that make us realize multiple things can be true and important at the same time. It is true that this is a difficult time for many of us personally and within our own families and relationships. It is also true that Vanderbilt needs to respond to this call to act by supporting our partners at VUMC as they care for residents from across the region. I send you my gratitude for thinking of others in our community and for supporting them as they carry out their mission.  You came to Vanderbilt to expand your sense of your own mission and role in the world. Now, as we have this same opportunity as a university, it is important we step up and act. This unprecedented time in history gives us the opportunity to support a larger mission of service to the community and society at large.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dear colleagues,</p>
<p>As we near the end of our third full week of remote work for many staff members, we want to thank you again for your ongoing efforts, flexibility and ingenuity as we navigate these unprecedented circumstances.</p>
<p>In response to current guidance from public health experts and in alignment with local, state and federal directives related to social distancing, university leadership has decided to <b>extend our remote work period through April 30. </b></p>
<p>During the first four weeks of remote work, we have been able to preserve staff pay and benefits, regardless of the nature of work or the source of funds. After careful financial analysis, we are pleased to be able to extend that same level of staff pay and benefit preservation through April 30. Pay and benefits will continue to be preserved during this time regardless of the nature of your work or the source of funds that support your position.</p>
<p>Your manager will be in direct contact with you to discuss your specific responsibilities during the remote work period. Details about how to record time in Oracle will be provided by your manager or HCM specialist and are posted in an <a href="https://www.vanderbilt.edu/coronavirus/faqs/if-i-am-working-remotely-how-should-i-report-my-time/" data-name="FAQ in the HR section of our website." data-type="url">FAQ in the HR section of our website.</a></p>
<p>We are taking these measures based on public health recommendations to protect our community’s health and to flatten the curve of the coronavirus disease&#8217;s spread.</p>
<p>In the weeks to come, university leadership will continue to monitor all developments closely and assess long-term financial impacts and how we will address those in order to ensure the continuity of our mission over the long-term. This includes evaluating all possible scenarios and necessary actions to support university operations after April 30, including any necessary changes to staffing levels and compensation. We will remain in communication with you, as will your manager, about next steps.</p>
<p>Please continue to monitor the <a href="https://www.vanderbilt.edu/coronavirus/hr-information/" data-name="HR information page" data-type="url">HR information page</a> and the <a href="https://it.vanderbilt.edu/services/catalog/end-point_computing/network_access/remote-access/Telecommuting.php#maincontent" data-name="telecommuting and remote work resources" data-type="url">telecommuting and remote work resources</a> on the <a href="https://www.vanderbilt.edu/coronavirus/" data-name="university’s COVID-19 webpage." data-type="url">university’s COVID-19 webpage.</a></p>
<p>To echo Interim Chancellor Wente’s words from her last <a href="https://news.vanderbilt.edu/2020/03/30/open-mind-keeping-vanderbilt-running-with-heart-and-soul/" data-name="Open Mind column" data-type="url">Open Mind column</a>, the “members of Vanderbilt’s staff have done so much to increase our community’s safety, productivity and well-being.” Thanks to each of you for bringing this statement to life.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p><b>Eric Kopstain</b><br />
Vice Chancellor for Administration</p>
<p><b>Laura Nairon </b><br />
Interim Associate Vice Chancellor for People and Business Services</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Many in our community are likely experiencing moments of anxiety and concern given the unprecedented times we are living in as a result of COVID-19.</p>

<p>Above all, please practice care for yourselves, your communities and each other, particularly during this time when social distancing can make many feel isolated.</p>
<p>If there is anything that we can do to bring you clarity and comfort as these circumstances continue to unfold, we encourage you to reach out and let us know.</p>
<p>Regards,</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dear Vanderbilt Students,</p>
<p>We appreciate your patience as we continue to navigate uncharted territory as a result of COVID-19. We are making decisions based on the best information we have at any given time, and our staff is working around the clock to provide student support and assist with getting each student’s belongings back to them.</p>
<p>That being said, we have an update on our campus residences. Vanderbilt will <strong>begin consolidating remaining students into a smaller number of residence halls on campus. </strong>Consolidation will allow us to better support the students remaining on campus in terms of managing facilities, providing meal deliveries, and ensuring adequate staffing in the buildings. We want to ensure students continue to feel safe and supported while on campus during this unusual time.</p>
<p>The consolidation will also enable Vanderbilt to support Vanderbilt University Medical Center (VUMC). As the demands on health care may increase exponentially, Vanderbilt will assist VUMC by providing housing for medical staff working long hours and multiple shifts to address the expected surge in health care needs. VU will be able to assist VUMC through utilization of Vanderbilt facilities that are unoccupied after the consolidation of students who remain on campus.</p>
<p><strong>If you have already left campus, what does this mean for you? </strong></p>
<p>We know many of you departed campus, or did not return after spring break, and are eager to make plans to retrieve your belongings. Nashville Mayor John Cooper has declared a “<a href="https://www.tennessean.com/story/news/2020/03/22/metro-directs-residents-stay-inside-stop-non-essential-errands/2894440001/">Safer At Home</a>” order until April 6. As a result, students will <strong>not be permitted to return to campus to remove belongings from their on-campus spaces until further notice. </strong></p>
<p>As a result of this planned consolidation, we may need to reassign current residents, and pack and ship, or store, belongings of already departed residents in certain residence halls. We will notify affected current and departed residents prior to taking any action. Please note that <a href="https://premiercollegestorage.com/1/Vanderbilt-University-Student-Storage">UPS</a>, our preferred provider, will be granted access to student spaces for the purpose of packing and shipping or storing student belongings at the student’s expense. Multiple occupant spaces may pose challenges to identifying ownership of items and we may reach out to roommates to provide remote assistance in order to properly pack belongings.<strong>  </strong></p>
<p><strong>We are asking for your help.</strong></p>
<p>We have prepared a very <a href="https://vanderbilt.datacenter.adirondacksolutions.com/VANDERBILT_THDSS_PROD/index.cfm">brief survey</a> that we are asking you to complete as soon as possible. The “Belonging Status Form” can be accessed in the Student Housing Portal under the Applications menu.</p>
<p>The survey will ask if you have left campus, if you left belongings behind, if the belongings are packed and labeled, and other questions that will help us plan appropriately to assist you to the best of our ability. If you lived in a building we are seeking to clear for VUMC use, we will communicate with you before we begin boxing any of your belongings.</p>
<p>We value and appreciate your cooperation as we do our best to support the critical health care workers serving our community during this crisis. As a reminder, for the most updated information on the university’s response to COVID-19, please visit <a href="http://www.vanderbilt.edu/coronavirus">www.vanderbilt.edu/coronavirus.</a></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dear Vanderbilt community,</p>
<p>The historic circumstances of the last few weeks have brought about unprecedented challenges and some of the most difficult decisions that university leaders across the country have ever had to face. Earlier today, I shared one of the most personally painful decisions to date with our students planning to graduate in May and their families.</p>
<p>Based on current CDC public health recommendations for maintaining social distancing through mid-May, and after deliberation with the deans of all of Vanderbilt’s schools and colleges, as well as members of our Board of Trust ad hoc committee on university COVID-19 response, I have reached <strong>the profoundly difficult decision not to hold Vanderbilt Commencement ceremonies, or other related activities, for this academic year.</strong></p>
<p>In lieu of gathering on May 8, <strong>we are committed to holding a series of special events for the Class of 2020 in May 2021.</strong> We envision these 2021 events to include a landmark postponed Commencement ceremony for the 2020 graduates as well as serving as a one-year reunion for the Class of 2020. I also will launch a process for assembling a group of students from the Class of 2020 to give input into these events, which should reflect their hopes and expectations surrounding this very special milestone.</p>
<p>I cannot overstate how challenging it has been to make this decision. Commencement is a sacred occasion throughout the Vanderbilt community and a well-deserved period of celebration for our newest graduates. Yet we are in a moment in history that demands—first and foremost—the protection and safety of our students and their families.</p>
<p>My heart aches knowing that we will not be able to celebrate in person on May 8, but I know the Vanderbilt community will continue to show empathy and compassion to the Class of 2020 during these extraordinary times. And when degrees are conferred in May with no formal ceremony, I know that our alumni will take extra care in welcoming the Class of 2020 into the prestigious networks of Vanderbilt graduates around the world.</p>
<p>I look forward to welcoming the Class of 2020 back to campus during next year’s festivities, alongside the many faculty and staff who do so much to honor our graduating students each year.</p>
<p>As we move forward together, I encourage you all to stay connected—with your classmates, your colleagues and the global Vanderbilt community. We are here for you as a university today and for many years to come.</p>
<p>With respect and admiration always,</p>
<p>Susan R. Wente<br />
Interim Chancellor and Provost</p>

<hr />
<p>Dear graduating students and families,</p>
<p>The historic circumstances of the last few weeks have required some of the most difficult decisions university leaders across the country have ever faced—and have brought about unprecedented challenges for graduating students and their families. Today, I write to you with one of the most painful decisions of all, and one that has been on my mind from the moment the COVID-19 crisis began.</p>
<p>Based on current CDC public health recommendations for maintaining social distancing through mid-May, and after deliberation with the deans of all of Vanderbilt’s schools and colleges and with our Board of Trust ad hoc committee on university COVID-19 response, I have reached <b>the profoundly difficult decision not to hold Vanderbilt Commencement ceremonies, or other related activities, for this academic year.</b></p>
<p>In lieu of gathering on May 8, <b>we are committed to holding a set of special events for you in May 2021. </b>We envision these events in May 2021 as both a historic postponed Commencement ceremony and a one-year reunion for the Class of 2020. Although we are working to determine specific dates, we are planning for these events to be held between May 12 and May 16, 2021. I am launching the process of assembling a group of students from the Class of 2020 to give input into the planning of these events to help us ensure they reflect your hopes and expectations for this incredibly special moment.</p>
<p>Please know your degrees will still be conferred when you have completed all requirements to be eligible to graduate, but no formal ceremony will be held in May 2020. Further, as they would have done in May 2020, the August and December 2019 graduates also will be welcomed for the postponed events in May 2021. For more information on degree conferral, please visit the <a href="http://www.vanderbilt.edu/commencement">Commencement website.</a></p>
<p>This has been an incredibly difficult decision. Commencement is a sacred time that we all share across the Vanderbilt community as a way of recognizing and celebrating the remarkable achievements and diligent work of our newest graduates. Yet we are in a time in history that demands—first and foremost—the protection and safety of our students and their families. My heart truly aches knowing that we will not be able to celebrate in person on May 8.</p>
<p><span class="e2ma-style"><a href="https://www.vanderbilt.edu/coronavirus/2020/03/12/a-message-to-graduating-students/">I have said before</a> </span>that this year’s graduating students’ resilience and ability to persevere through trying times are extraordinary. There is no doubt in my mind that you will use these circumstances to learn and to grow. Perhaps for some of you, it may even alter the course of your lives in a positive way, whether that comes in the form of discovering new ways to fight this disease or finding innovative solutions to help safeguard the public from future pandemics—or it may simply renew your spirit of empathy and compassion.</p>
<p>As we move forward, I encourage you to stay focused on your studies, pursue your academic and professional goals with vigor, and remain connected to your friends, classmates, professors, advisers and the Vanderbilt community at large. We are here for you—today, this semester, on the day your degrees are conferred and for many years to come.</p>
<p>With respect and admiration always,</p>
<p><span class="e2ma-style"><b>Susan R. Wente</b><br />

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dear colleagues,</p>
<p>As you have likely seen, <a href="https://t.e2ma.net/message/921lvd/d23pkv" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the university is further reinforcing its remote work policy</a> in light of the new <a href="https://www.asafenashville.org/safer-at-home-order/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Safer at Home Order</a> issued by the Nashville Metro Public Health Department on March 22, which goes into effect Monday, March 23.</p>
<p>Given this, please note that <strong>remote teaching on campus is not an absolute necessity and should be conducted off campus.</strong></p>
<p><strong>All faculty should work remotely unless provided an exception from their dean or department chair based on the absolute necessity that they be on campus to do their work, such as those responsible for lab safety, care for lab animals, and simulation lab instruction in medicine and nursing.</strong></p>
<p>The university recognizes that faculty may need to retrieve materials from their offices, labs and classrooms. Faculty should retrieve these resources by the end of the day on Monday, March 23.</p>
<p>Online and alternative education will continue as planned. Again, <strong>faculty should teach courses remotely and not come to campus</strong>. Faculty and students should participate in online and alternative education in situations that allow them to maintain <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/php/risk-assessment.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">social distancing protocols recommended by the CDC</a>.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Tracey George<br />
Vice Provost for Faculty Affairs</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dear Vanderbilt students and families,</p>
<p>As we continue to respond and adapt to the evolving impact of the global coronavirus pandemic, Vanderbilt University remains steadfast in our commitment to our community and our teaching and research mission.</p>
<p>The well-being and success of our students and community is our top priority. With that in mind, I wanted to share two new initiatives with you today to support our students and their families during this difficult time. <strong>These include housing and dining financial adjustments for the spring 2020 semester and the launch of a newly established Student Hardship Fund.</strong></p>
<p>We understand the disappointment, difficulties and uncertainty caused by these unprecedented times, and hope that these initiatives will assist in smoothing the transition and alleviating some of the difficulties Vanderbilt students and their families may be facing.</p>
<h3><strong>Adjustment details</strong></h3>
<p>Students who have left campus or are leaving campus by March 22 as requested will receive an adjustment in housing and dining costs for a period of time. Both housing and dining adjustments will take into account the student’s financial aid. <strong><a href="https://www.vanderbilt.edu/coronavirus/faq/#adjustments-and-student-hardship-fund" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Please see the FAQ on the COVID-19 website for more details on the housing and dining adjustments</a>.</strong></p>
<p>Students are not required to request an adjustment for spring 2020 room and board charges; all credits for housing and dining will be calculated and applied automatically to the appropriate student’s account on or before April 15, 2020.</p>
<p>We will begin to process adjustments immediately in order to get them to you as quickly as possible, as we recognize the economic circumstances many students and families face during this urgent public health emergency. Students will see the adjustments reflected on their student account portal.</p>
<p>More details about the adjustments are available on the university’s <strong><a href="https://www.vanderbilt.edu/coronavirus/faq/#adjustments-and-student-hardship-fund" target="_blank" rel="noopener">COVID-19 website</a></strong>, including information on adjustments for Opportunity Vanderbilt students.</p>
<h3><strong>Student Hardship Fund</strong></h3>
<p>To further support our students facing significant challenges as a result of having to leave campus, we are also announcing that <strong>the university is providing $1 million to launch a new Student Hardship Fund</strong>. The fund will help undergraduate, graduate and professional students with demonstrated need by alleviating financial burdens associated with the unexpected and abrupt changes to their Vanderbilt experience necessitated by this global public health crisis.</p>
<p>We have posted an <strong><a href="https://www.vanderbilt.edu/financialaid/hardship/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">online application form</a></strong> that students with demonstrated need can use to request support. We are committed to ensuring rapid turnaround of all approved requests.<a href="https://www.vanderbilt.edu/coronavirus/faq/#adjustments-and-student-hardship-fund" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> <strong>More details are available on the university’s COVID-19 website</strong></a>.</p>
<p>A number of alumni and donors have already reached out to express their desire to help students in need during this time. We, as always, appreciate our alumni’s lifelong commitment to our mission and will work with them to further build the fund.</p>
<h3><strong>Supporting the Vanderbilt community</strong></h3>
<p>We are taking these measures to help address some of the impacts the coronavirus pandemic has had on our students and their families. We have also committed to preserving the compensation and benefits of our housing, dining and other staff whose roles were affected by the move to alternative and online education this semester as though the school year proceeded as normal.</p>
<p>As we move forward, we will continue to heed the advice from the CDC and our own experts at Vanderbilt University Medical Center and will continue our efforts to be as nimble and swift as possible with our actions and communications.</p>
<p>Your patience, solidarity and dedication is both appreciated and inspiring. We are a community committed, together, to each other in this challenging time.</p>
<p>With appreciation,</p>
<p><strong>Susan R. Wente</strong><br />
Interim Chancellor and Provost</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dear colleagues,</p>
<p>As Interim Chancellor Wente noted in her Open Mind column on Monday, “Day-to-day life at Vanderbilt looks significantly different today than it did last Monday.” Of course, one significant difference is the fact that students have, for the most part, moved out; another is that our research laboratories are ramping down; another is that we implemented an <strong>initial remote work period of Monday, March 16, through Friday, March 27. </strong>As we end the first week of the first phase of remote work activity, we want to echo Interim Chancellor Wente’s gratitude for everyone’s contributions during these extraordinary circumstances and share information about upcoming phases of remote work.</p>
<p>Given the unpredictable nature of the ongoing national and local COVID-19 situation, the university leadership has decided that an additional two-week <strong>Phase II remote work period </strong>will commence immediately following the initial phase. Thus, <strong>remote work will continue from today, March 20, through Saturday, April 11.</strong> As with the initial phase and regardless of the source of funds that support your position, <strong>staff pay and benefits will be preserved, and your manager will be in direct contact with you to discuss your specific responsibilities during this additional remote work period.  </strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong>Whether the work of your position can be accomplished remotely, requires your presence on campus, or the nature of your work is such that there is not remote work available, there are provisions to continue your pay and benefits. Details about how to record time in Oracle will be provided by your manager or HCM specialist and is posted in an <a href="https://nam04.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Ft.e2ma.net%2Fclick%2Fde17td%2F9i24ew%2F5z4m6cb&amp;data=02%7C01%7Claura.nairon%40Vanderbilt.Edu%7Cf39e034a3e974d3ea84708d7c795ec6e%7Cba5a7f39e3be4ab3b45067fa80faecad%7C0%7C0%7C637197319031962395&amp;sdata=QU8Ds%2FlAkSmqpC17r8H%2BbpCvPk%2BTv%2BIUukd3lJQJDyE%3D&amp;reserved=0"><strong>FAQ in the HR section of our website.</strong></a></p>
<p>Vanderbilt, with the rest of the U.S., has entered into an unprecedented time that is proving to have impacts on our nation’s physical and financial health. We are taking these actions as a responsible measure to ensure social distancing and “flatten the curve” of the coronavirus disease spread. We continue to monitor developments and, to the greatest extent possible, seek to anticipate emerging issues and prepare accordingly.</p>
<p>These are challenging times for all, and as we navigate a path forward, we will stay in touch via email notifications and website updates.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dear tenure-track faculty member:</p>
<p>We are reaching out to reassure you that you have Vanderbilt’s full support during these challenging times with the coronavirus outbreak as we carry out our mission as a leading research university.</p>
<p>The successful move to online courses and alternative education—one of several steps the university has taken to protect the health and safety of our community—has required all of us to embrace rapid change and innovation. In addition, the ramping down of operations with all research laboratories has been disruptive to the research and scholarly activities of you, your students and your research team. We are fully aware of the difficulties this minimal on-campus activity is posing.</p>
<p>We are grateful for all that you are doing to ensure that Vanderbilt remains a collaborative community with informed and creative teaching, renowned research and service to others.</p>
<p>In light of these increased demands at work—and for many, at home—that could slow down or temporarily interrupt your professional career, the deans of all our schools and colleges are in agreement with the provost and interim chancellor that we should take the unusual measure of granting an automatic one-year extension to the tenure clock of all probationary faculty who are not currently under review for tenure.</p>
<p>Tenure-track faculty may choose to opt out of the length of the extension (requesting only one semester (six months for 12-month faculty) or opt out of the extension completely. In order to opt out of an automatic extension of the tenure clock, you must notify your dean in writing no later than one year prior to the time when you would otherwise come up for tenure. For tenure track faculty who will be reviewed for tenure in the upcoming academic year, you must notify your dean by June 1 if you wish to opt out of the extension in whole or in part.</p>
<p>This automatic extension does <u>not</u> affect the ability of a faculty member, with the consent of their dean, to come up early for tenure. The extension only affects the length of the probationary period.</p>
<p>If you have any questions or concerns regarding the extension, you may contact your dean, Vice Provost for Faculty Affairs Tracey George (<a href="mailto:tracey.george@vanderbilt.edu?subject=question%20about%20tenure%20track%20"><strong>tracey.george@vanderbilt.edu</strong></a>) (for VU-employed faculty), or Senior Associate Dean for Faculty Affairs David Raiford (<a href="mailto:david.raiford@vanderbilt.edu?subject=question%20about%20tenure%20track"><strong>david.raiford@vanderbilt.edu</strong></a>) (for VUMC-employed faculty).</p>
<p>I know that by working together and supporting each other, we will navigate any challenges ahead and become a more resilient community.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Susan R. Wente<br />
Interim Chancellor and Provost</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dear undergraduate students,</p>
<p>In light of the extraordinary circumstances under which you will be completing your spring semester, the deans of the Blair School of Music, the College of Arts and Science, Peabody College of education and human development, and the School of Engineering have agreed to extend the deadline for students to change their enrollments from graded to pass/fail grading basis. <strong>To be clear, all undergraduate classes, regardless of prior status, are now eligible for pass/fail grading.</strong></p>
<p>The original deadline of January 20 has been extended to April 10. In addition, most policies that surround pass/fail enrollments have been suspended for the spring 2020 semester to allow classes in any category of degree requirement to be taken pass/fail, even if not typically allowed under normal circumstances.</p>
<p>Prior to the April 10 deadline, undergraduate students will receive a communication with instructions on how to make pass/fail selections if they so desire. <strong>There is no need to submit any requests at this time.</strong> For more information, <a href="https://registrar.vanderbilt.edu/pass-fail-spring-2020-undergraduate.php">please see this FAQ from the Office of the University Registrar</a>.</p>
<p>Thank you again for your patience and understanding as we have navigated these unprecedented events. Please continue to stay informed about the university’s response at <a href="https://www.vanderbilt.edu/coronavirus/">vu.edu/coronavirus</a>.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="e2ma-p-div">
<p><span class="e2ma-style">Dear Vanderbilt alumni community,</span></p>
<p>We are writing during this time of great uncertainty to express our concern and support for you and your families. As a member of our alumni community, you are top of mind for us, along with our students, faculty and staff.</p>
<p>We have all been affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. You may know that Vanderbilt has moved fully to online and alternative learning for the remainder of the semester and students have been asked to move out of on-campus residences. We have also suspended all university-sponsored events and gatherings through April 30 and instituted an initial remote work period for staff beginning March 16 through March 27. We decided to take these steps based on public health recommendations and best practices and because the health and safety of our community are of the utmost importance.</p>
<p>Additionally, the Vanderbilt University Board of Trust has established an ad hoc committee to support the university’s response to COVID-19. The new <a href="https://news.vanderbilt.edu/2020/03/17/board-of-trust-establishes-ad-hoc-committee-to-support-universitys-coronavirus-response/">Ad Hoc Committee on University COVID-19 Response</a> will serve as an advisory group and resource as ongoing actions are considered in efforts related to educating students using online and alternate methods, continuing research and supporting campus activities disrupted by the global pandemic.</p>
<p>While our campus is the heart of this university, our people are its soul. This challenging situation is necessitating a temporary change to how we deliver education and conduct research and scholarship, but it will not deter us from the pursuit of our mission. During times like these, the Commodore spirit of collaboration and care prevails. We are proud of the ways we have already seen our community come together to support one another.</p>
<p>We encourage you to visit <a href="https://www.vanderbilt.edu/coronavirus/">Vanderbilt’s COVID-19 website</a> for updates on the university’s response. You will also find resources and links to the latest information on preventive measures.</p>
<p>More than anything, we hope you will reach out to each other. The relationships you formed here are bonds that endure a lifetime. Together we will navigate this difficult time, and we are confident we will emerge a more resilient community.</p>
<p>Wherever you are in the world today, please know that your Vanderbilt family is thinking of you.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Susan R. Wente<br />
Interim Chancellor and Provost</p>
<p>Bruce R. Evans, BE&#8217;81<br />
Chairman of the Board of Trust</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>As positive tests for the novel coronavirus that causes COVID-19 have now been confirmed for several undergraduate students, Vanderbilt University advises the university community to further heed public health and safety recommendations.</h3>
<p>In order to protect the health and safety of our community during this unprecedented public health challenge, Vanderbilt has taken a number of steps to reduce the spread of COVID-19, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>All classes moved fully to <a href="https://www.vanderbilt.edu/coronavirus/2020/03/11/community-alternative-education/">online and alternative learning</a> for the remainder of the semester.</li>
<li>All undergraduate residential students were required to <a href="https://www.vanderbilt.edu/coronavirus/2020/03/12/mar-12-2020-further-information-about-move-out/">move out by Sunday, March 15.</a></li>
<li>Any remaining students who were granted an extension due to extenuating circumstances must stay in their residences as much as possible, avoid congregating in common spaces, and practice social distancing.</li>
<li>Enhanced cleaning and sanitation protocols are being implemented across campus.</li>
<li>The university <a href="https://www.vanderbilt.edu/coronavirus/2020/03/14/march-14-2020-update-from-the-division-of-administration-on-new-campus-dining-safety-protocols/">restricted access to dining facilities</a> and implemented new safety protocols to promote social distancing for all remaining dining and food delivery on campus.</li>
<li>Vanderbilt instituted an initial <a href="https://www.vanderbilt.edu/coronavirus/2020/03/13/mar-13-2020-remote-work-for-staff-march-16-march-27/">remote work period with staff and faculty</a> and recommended they work remotely following their manager’s and/or department chair/dean’s instructions.</li>
<li>On-campus university research laboratories are transitioning to only essential activities by Wednesday, March 18, at the latest.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.vanderbilt.edu/coronavirus/2020/03/15/mar-15-2020-vandyride-services-suspended-on-call-medical-transportation-service-continues/">VandyRides service has been suspended.</a> Vanderbilt University Public Safety will continue to provide an on-call medical transportation service.</li>
<li>The David Williams II Recreation and Wellness Center is closed until further notice.</li>
</ul>
<p>The university continues to work closely with public health officials who will communicate directly with people who may have been exposed to any individuals in the university community who have tested positive for coronavirus disease, COVID-19.</p>
<p><strong>Any student remaining on campus or living locally who experiences symptoms associated with COVID-19 should contact the </strong><a href="https://www.vumc.org/student-health/welcome">Student Health Center</a>. <strong>Students who have left the Nashville metro area should contact their local health provider. Faculty, staff and postdocs should contact the </strong><a href="https://www.vumc.org/health-wellness/occupational-health">Occupational Health Clinic</a><strong> or contact their medical provider.</strong></p>
<p>As a reminder, the CDC always recommends everyday preventive actions to limit the spread of respiratory viruses, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. Use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol if soap and water are not available.</li>
<li>Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands.</li>
<li>Avoid close contact with people who are sick.</li>
<li>Stay home when you are sick.</li>
<li>Cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue, then throw the tissue in the trash.</li>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Update: Phase II of Remote Work in place until April 11</strong></p>
<p>Dear colleagues,</p>
<p>The rapid evolution of the COVID-19 pandemic requires Vanderbilt University to accelerate its response to this unprecedented challenge. In order to protect the health and safety of our community, <u><strong>all on-campus research laboratories will be restricted to only essential activities by close of business on Monday, March 16, where possible, and by Wednesday, March 18, at the latest.</strong></u></p>
<p>Similar to our peers, including Harvard, Stanford, MIT and Johns Hopkins, we are ramping down all on-campus research laboratory activities. Minimal access to laboratories will be maintained so that critical activities, such as maintaining unique reagents and essential equipment and materials, can continue.</p>
<p>Based on the directive of the provost, your deans have already been in communication with you about ramping down research. Each faculty member should work with their laboratory personnel (students, postdocs and staff) to ramp down operations as soon as practical. <strong>We know that many of you have already started to ramp down your laboratories, and the ramp down must be complete by Monday, March 16, or at the latest by Wednesday, March 18.</strong> If you need more time, please inform your department chair and the dean, provide a concise justification, and receive written approval. Please consult with your department chair or the dean with questions about specific issues. <strong>You should plan for a remote-work research operation that could last for an indefinite period and could possibly be longer than the initial two weeks outlined in Interim Chancellor and Provost Wente’s campus email on Friday.</strong></p>
<p>We understand that this will be disruptive to the research and scholarly activities of you, your students and your research team, and we will work to support your efforts. We encourage you to take this time to focus on the activities that can be completed remotely, such as writing papers and grant proposals and completing data analysis. The university’s COVID-19 website includes <a href="https://nam04.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Ft.e2ma.net%2Fclick%2F1g7kud%2Fxdygtu%2Fpbvicdb&amp;data=02%7C01%7Ckara.furlong%40vanderbilt.edu%7Ce0e3635583c94b09ff2408d7c936f835%7Cba5a7f39e3be4ab3b45067fa80faecad%7C0%7C0%7C637199110243048894&amp;sdata=ijgFXgF%2B7JE%2BPegYgF%2Bc0pB4gcKB7iIJYrD9JoySpLA%3D&amp;reserved=0">resources for telecommuting and remote work</a>.</p>
<p>We expect you will not make any immediate changes to the support of your staff, students and postdocs. Faculty are responsible for assigning and overseeing the work performed remotely by their students, postdocs and staff. The chain of essential functions throughout the university will be in place throughout this time to enable faculty to submit grants, reports, etc.</p>
<p>Please continue charging to grants as normal. Our research administration offices are prepared for fully remote support. We also have been working with research sponsors as part of our business continuity activities to ensure that we continue to operate in a compliant and appropriate manner.</p>
<p>We are fully aware of the difficulties this minimal on-campus activity will pose, and we will work closely with the appropriate evaluator bodies within your schools to minimize the impact on your professional advancement and the advancement of your students and staff.</p>
<p>Further information related to the ongoing performance of clinical and human subject research will be provided separately. We have been diligently preparing phased plans to maintain continuity of services for these research activities during this difficult time.</p>
<p>You need to complete contingency plans for your research immediately. Be prepared for this reduced level of operations to last longer than two weeks.</p>
<p>Please read these details carefully:</p>
<p>·      Beginning March 18, access to labs will only be available for essential personnel who perform critical procedures, processes or equipment management that requires regular personnel attention to maintain laboratory viability (e.g. liquid nitrogen tank filling, maintaining shared computational equipment). Notify your departmental administrator as soon as possible about who these individuals are.</p>
<p>·      PIs should immediately identify essential research experiments that are at a critical phase, meaning that abandoning them would cause a major or irreversible loss in project momentum. This high-priority work should be a limited set of the current laboratory bench-based experimentation.</p>
<p>·      Even essential work in labs should be staggered so that minimal laboratory personnel are present at any one time.</p>
<p>·      Please continue charging to grants as normal.</p>
<p>·      No undergraduates or external visitors are allowed in labs.</p>
<p>·      Make sure you have access to contact information for your students, postdocs and staff, and review contingency plans and emergency procedures within your group.</p>
<p>If anyone carrying out critical research activities demonstrates minor symptoms of illness, including but not limited to cough or fever, that person has to stay home. If someone has doubt about whether they could be <u>ill</u> they should NOT come to work. Refer to the university’s COVID-19 website for guidance on <a href="https://nam04.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Ft.e2ma.net%2Fclick%2F1g7kud%2Fxdygtu%2F53vicdb&amp;data=02%7C01%7Ckara.furlong%40vanderbilt.edu%7Ce0e3635583c94b09ff2408d7c936f835%7Cba5a7f39e3be4ab3b45067fa80faecad%7C0%7C0%7C637199110243048894&amp;sdata=rx%2BDTMttF68j5s8Hn%2BM%2BW6p1B2Ki3lawjlQve%2FvW6qo%3D&amp;reserved=0">what to do if you are sick</a>. In addition, individuals should disinfect common laboratory areas, including the bench top and shared keyboards/mice, and touch points (e.g. doorknobs, sink handles, freezer doors, telephones) with 70 percent ethanol or a virucidal disinfectant at least twice daily. Additional <a href="https://nam04.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Ft.e2ma.net%2Fclick%2F1g7kud%2Fxdygtu%2Flwwicdb&amp;data=02%7C01%7Ckara.furlong%40vanderbilt.edu%7Ce0e3635583c94b09ff2408d7c936f835%7Cba5a7f39e3be4ab3b45067fa80faecad%7C0%7C0%7C637199110243058882&amp;sdata=SVLkgKb%2B3aegh5hGHr9HkGxJvCKMtWhu80wrD9RTQOk%3D&amp;reserved=0">guidance for researchers</a> is available on the COVID-19 website.</p>
<p>Consistent with the urgency of the current public health situation, the university is taking substantial steps to limit the spread of the virus while supporting the important work of our colleagues. Messages to the Vanderbilt community, information and resources are updated frequently on the university’s COVID-19 website: <a href="https://nam04.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Ft.e2ma.net%2Fclick%2F1g7kud%2Fxdygtu%2F1oxicdb&amp;data=02%7C01%7Ckara.furlong%40vanderbilt.edu%7Ce0e3635583c94b09ff2408d7c936f835%7Cba5a7f39e3be4ab3b45067fa80faecad%7C0%7C0%7C637199110243058882&amp;sdata=EARRhl6j3A7Q4C%2F%2BwHfWw9hRQWDC4H8HFiTBKtzPm8w%3D&amp;reserved=0">vu.edu/coronavirus</a>.</p>
<p>Finally, it is our foremost desire that you stay safe. Wash your hands frequently and practice social distancing.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We are recommending students return to their homes. This recommendation is based on the unpredictable nature of the global COVID-19 pandemic, where cases can spike quickly in any region, as described by the World Health Organization and within the CDC Global COVID-19 Outbreak Notice. This unpredictability also puts stress on existing health systems in regions with COVID-19 cases, which may make obtaining other medical care much more difficult. Likewise, we are aware that local and international travel is increasingly challenging due to transportation disruptions or cancellations as well as rapidly changing immigration regulations and border restrictions.</p>
<p>With these factors in mind, we strongly believe that our students are better able to navigate the pandemic at their homes or permanent residences. At home, they will be within their personal networks, in a familiar health system, and in a place where they are less susceptible to future immigration and transportation disruptions.</p>
<p>Students receiving financial aid to support study abroad who have questions should contact the Financial Aid office at <a href="mailto:finaid@vanderbilt.edu">finaid@vanderbilt.edu</a>.</p>
<p>We understand that our recommendation will create disappointment among some students while others may find it a relief. Students who have previously indicated an interest in remaining abroad by submitting a form to SARAC will be contacted by Vanderbilt’s global safety and security manager regarding next steps. Our highest priority remains our students’ well-being.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dear Vanderbilt Students,</p>
<p>I am following up with a health and safety reminder in light of the <a href="https://www.vanderbilt.edu/coronavirus/2020/03/14/mar-14-2020-positive-covid-19-case-on-campus/">news today</a> that an non-residential, undergraduate Vanderbilt student has tested positive for COVID-19.</p>
<p>The Tennessee Department of Health recommends that in order to decrease the spread of COVID-19, students should avoid sharing drinks, cups or utensils. Students should also avoid large gatherings; we encourage you to stay home and only gather in small groups, while practicing social distancing.  It is imperative that you take steps to limit your exposure. You should particularly avoid sharing cups in drinking games or participating in large, packed parties.</p>
<p>We are in the midst of public health emergency and the individual actions we each take at this time will have an impact on the spread of illness. By following common sense prevention measures, you protect your own health and the health of others, especially those who may have compromised immune systems.</p>
<p><strong>The Student Health Center will be open today until 6:00 pm</strong> to evaluate students who are experiencing COVID-19 symptoms (cough, shortness of breath, fever) or who have questions about exposure.  Students, who have already left campus for home and our concerned about their health, should contact their local health providers.</p>
<p>Close contacts of the positive case will be notified by the Health Department of their exposure.  Any students who think they may have been exposed should stay home and self-isolate.  All students should remain extra vigilant for <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/symptoms-testing/symptoms.html?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fcoronavirus%2F2019-ncov%2Fabout%2Fsymptoms.html">symptoms</a> of COVID-19.  Anyone developing symptoms may call the VUMC COVID-19 hotline at 888-3132-0847 or may contact the Student Health Center on-call provider at 615-322-2427.</p>
<p>Continue to stay informed with the latest health and campus information at <a href="https://www.vanderbilt.edu/coronavirus">vu.edu/coronavirus</a>.</p>
<p>Best,</p>
<p>Mark Bandas<br />
Associate Provost and Dean of Students</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Division of Administration announced new safety protocols to promote social distancing for all dining facilities on campus. Campus Dining has implemented the following changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Campus Dining facilities are <strong>open only to current Vanderbilt students, essential campus staff, residential faculty and the immediate family of residential faculty</strong>.</li>
<li>All dining facilities have moved to <strong>boxed meals and food, </strong>and patrons are encouraged to take food to go. Campus Dining staff is preparing the food using all recommended CDC safety protocols and then boxing the food. Campus Dining staff, while wearing gloves, is handing all boxed food directly to those patronizing the facilities.</li>
<li>Campus Dining has deployed <strong>contactless card readers</strong> at all registers; dining patrons simply tap their cards on the readers when exiting the dining facilities with a meal.</li>
<li>In an effort to maintain CDC-recommended social distancing practices, Campus Dining is working with patrons at the entry of each dining facility to limit the number of people in a serving area at any given time.</li>
</ul>
<p>These updates are in addition to previous changes implemented at Campus Dining:</p>
<ul>
<li>Implementing touchless item scanning at Munchie Marts</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Eliminating reusable serving ware (plates, cups, utensils) at all dining halls, and removing self-service options from all dining locations to reduce the opportunity for cross-contamination</li>
<li>Enhanced cleaning in all locations, enforcing frequent glove changes, enforcing enhanced handwashing protocols</li>
<li>Lifting restrictions on Munchie Mart swipes. To support social distancing, students can now use market swipes up to 3 times per day (max. 1 per hour), in lieu of dining hall swipes.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Division of Administration, including Campus Dining, is monitoring all protocols and will communicate any updates to both the <a href="http://vu.edu/dining">Campus Dining website</a> and <a href="http://vu.edu/coronavirus">Vanderbilt’s COVID-19 website</a>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>IMPORTANT UPDATE: <a href="https://www.vanderbilt.edu/coronavirus/2020/03/20/mar-20-2020-remote-work-for-staff-extended-through-april-11/">On March 20, the university extended the remote work period through April 11. Read more.</a></strong></p>
<p>Dear colleagues,</p>
<p>In order to protect the health and safety of our community during this unprecedented public health challenge, <b>Vanderbilt University is instituting an initial remote work period beginning Monday, March 16, through Friday, March 27. </b>Individual remote work decisions require approval by your manager. Further guidance on time periods beyond March 27 will be included in subsequent communications.</p>
<p>The work that our staff carry out for the university is comprehensive and its nature varies widely. <b>Your manager will be in direct contact with you by the end of the weekend about how your area will manage your specific responsibilities during this period. </b>Individuals working in research laboratories will receive specific direction from their deans and department chairs.</p>
<p>We strongly encourage you to familiarize yourself with the <a href="https://www.vanderbilt.edu/coronavirus/hr-information/">HR information page</a> and the <a href="https://it.vanderbilt.edu/services/catalog/end-point_computing/network_access/remote-access/Telecommuting.php#maincontent">telecommuting and remote work resources</a> on the <a href="http://vu.edu/coronavirus">university’s COVID-19 webpage.</a></p>
<p>Even with this challenge, there are key on-campus operations that must continue to support educational, research, and residential functions. Managers will communicate directly with their staff in these areas to ensure these services continue.</p>
<p>Please be assured that <b>staff pay and benefits during this initial remote work period will be preserved. </b>Details about how time should be recorded in Oracle will be provided by your manager and posted in an <a href="https://www.vanderbilt.edu/coronavirus/hr-information/">FAQ in the HR section of our website.</a></p>
<p>I want to share my sincere and heartfelt gratitude to each of you for your dedication and commitment to our mission during this unprecedented time. I know many of you are working well beyond your normal schedule and responsibilities to help the university address this health challenge, all while managing your and your family’s own concerns. Your commitment to Vanderbilt is abundantly clear.</p>
<p>The actions we have taken and are taking are substantial, but please know that they are not taken lightly and are based on the best recommendations of public health experts. This situation is extraordinary and it requires such action; it also requires calm and focus. First and foremost, stay safe. Wash your hands frequently, and practice social distancing.</p>
<p>We are a strong, united community—that has not changed, nor will it. We will continue to be in touch with more information in the coming days. Thank you for all that you do for our great university.</p>
<p>With deep appreciation,</p>
<p>Susan R. Wente<br />
Interim Chancellor and Provost</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dear graduating students, the Class of 2020,</p>
<p>This spring, your last semester on our campus, is a time I know you and your families have been anticipating for many years. For some, you will be earning your undergraduate degrees; for others, this will mark the culmination of your graduate and professional degrees. For all of you, though, I am fully aware that our actions to prevent COVID-19 spread have caused a disruption in this special semester as well as anxiety and concern. I am as heartbroken as you are that your final months at Vanderbilt, and multiple opportunities to celebrate your crowning achievements, are being impacted by this global crisis.</p>
<p>I know that many of you have successfully navigated challenging situations in the past, and while this one is certainly both historic and unique, I am confident that we will be a resilient community and that each of you will not only persevere, but learn from this experience. Indeed, we all will learn much from this extraordinary challenge.</p>
<p>Though we have suspended university events through April 30, at this time we currently plan to hold Commencement on May 8. We expect to make further decisions in mid-April. We will continue to evaluate the situation and keep you directly informed of any changes. We also will include any updates on the <a href="http://www.vanderbilt.edu/commencement">Commencement website</a>. Our No. 1 priority is always the health and safety of every member of our Vanderbilt community.</p>
<p>In the meantime, I encourage you to remain focused on a strong finish to your studies. Our faculty and staff are working around the clock to put in place alternative learning strategies to ensure your ability to complete your work and meet your academic goals. Further, our campus resources are mobilizing to continue providing support remotely—the Career Center and the University Counseling Center are two examples of these efforts.</p>
<p>It is my utmost wish that you remain connected with your advisers, your friends and your classmates. Remain steadfast, as I am, in the knowledge that your Vanderbilt education and the relationships you made, the learning you achieved and the experiences you had during your time here on campus—including this final semester—will serve you well in the years to come. You are “Vanderbilt for Life.”</p>
<p>With respect and admiration,</p>
<p>Susan R. Wente<br />
Interim Chancellor and Provost</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Update: All Athletics events are suspended for the remainder of the spring season.</strong></p>
<p>Dear Vanderbilt Community,</p>
<p>Due to concerns about the spread of the coronavirus (COVID-19), the Southeastern Conference <a href="https://nam04.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Ft.e2ma.net%2Fclick%2F1wbvtd%2Fxxtu8z%2Fl0j32cb&amp;data=02%7C01%7Ckate.derrick%40vanderbilt.edu%7C5ff9f9d1c7b944a8933508d7c6ad92bd%7Cba5a7f39e3be4ab3b45067fa80faecad%7C0%7C0%7C637196321098088472&amp;sdata=Gfg6ZaDr57uQT%2Fnpssa3nPjAjOf5puZrZ6LJYZS488g%3D&amp;reserved=0">today</a> canceled the SEC Men’s Basketball Tournament in Nashville. In addition, and effective immediately, regular season competition for teams in all sports on SEC campuses, as well as SEC championship events, will be suspended until March 30.</p>
<p>As an institution and to protect the health and well-being of our student-athletes, fans and staff, Vanderbilt will enact this policy for in-season events for each of Vanderbilt’s varsity programs.</p>
<p>The announcement will impact schedules for Vanderbilt Athletics programs currently in season, including baseball, men’s and women’s golf, men’s and women’s tennis, and track and field. Events involving two Vanderbilt programs affiliated with other conferences—bowling (Southern Bowling League) and lacrosse (American Athletic Conference)—also will be suspended through March 30.</p>
<p>The decision comes just a day after the NCAA, SEC and other leagues across the country took several steps to limit the spread of COVID-19.</p>
<p>We know this is a challenging time for everyone, and we appreciate your continued support as we work to address this extraordinary public health issue. Our commitment to the safety and well-being of our entire community, including our outstanding student-athletes, dedicated staff and coaches, remains steadfast and is our top priority.</p>
<p>For information and updates related to the broad set of actions Vanderbilt University is taking to address COVID-19, please visit <a href="https://nam04.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Ft.e2ma.net%2Fclick%2F1wbvtd%2Fxxtu8z%2F1sk32cb&amp;data=02%7C01%7Ckate.derrick%40vanderbilt.edu%7C5ff9f9d1c7b944a8933508d7c6ad92bd%7Cba5a7f39e3be4ab3b45067fa80faecad%7C0%7C0%7C637196321098098471&amp;sdata=b%2BUfjXVBHNwxbsY%2FkbFpjTdShtjXRVnX98%2FNDAXym88%3D&amp;reserved=0">vu.edu/coronavirus</a>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dear colleagues,</p>
<p>As Interim Chancellor and Provost Susan R. Wente <a href="http://www.vanderbilt.edu/coronavirus/2020/03/11/community-alternative-education/">shared today</a>, Vanderbilt University Medical Center has informed us that a VUMC health care worker has tested positive for COVID-19.</p>
<p>Out of an abundance of caution and based on public health recommendations and best practices, we are moving fully to online and alternative learning for the remainder of the semester starting Monday, March 16, and have instructed all undergraduate residential students to make plans to move out by March 15.</p>
<p><b>Our campus remains safe and open, and staff are expected to work their normal schedule. </b>If you have questions about your schedule or work arrangements, please inquire with your manager.</p>
<p>We understand that staff may be concerned about their own safety in light of these developments. It is very important to note that <b>our residential facilities have different public health concerns than our other facilities: </b>They are the students’ homes, where they eat, sleep, bathe and socialize. As such, they carry very different risks and standards than workplaces, and require different actions to protect health and limit the transmission of the disease. To be clear, no students living on campus have tested positive to date—this is a preventive step.</p>
<p>We are continuing our cleaning, sanitizing, social distancing and other best practices to keep our campus safe. Please see the FAQs on our <a href="https://www.vanderbilt.edu/coronavirus/" data-type="url" data-name="coronavirus website">coronavirus website</a> for details on the many actions the university is taking to protect the safety of our community. Please also review Human Resources-specific information at the <a href="https://www.vanderbilt.edu/coronavirus/hr-information/" data-type="url" data-name="HR FAQ on the site">HR FAQ on the site</a>. The website will be updated regularly and frequently with the latest information.</p>
<p>Staff are an integral part of supporting the mission of the university and keeping campus operations running smoothly, now more than ever. The university is committed to protecting your safety and well-being and to working with you to address any questions you may have. Again, if you have questions, please first talk with your manager. If you need additional help, you may <a href="https://hr.vanderbilt.edu/hrconsulting/" data-type="url" data-name="find your HR consultant on the HR website.">find your HR consultant on the HR website.</a></p>
<p>It is with deep appreciation and admiration that we serve with you, our staff colleagues.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p><b>Laura Nairon</b><br />
Interim Associate Vice Chancellor for People and Business Services</p>
<p><b>Eric Kopstain</b><br />
Vice Chancellor for Administration</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dear Vanderbilt community,</p>
<p>Today, we received notice from Vanderbilt University Medical Center that a VUMC health care worker has tested positive for COVID-19. Out of an abundance of caution and based on public health recommendations and best practices, <strong>we will move fully to online and alternative learning for the remainder of the semester. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Given that, all <u>undergraduate residential students</u> should make plans to move out by March 15</strong>. We are actively working on plans to assist undergraduate residential students with move out and are evaluating an approach to address on-campus housing and dining fees for the remaining month of classes. We will send details about those plans to the students and families. Students who need to remain on campus beyond this date will receive further information.</p>
<p>Classes remain cancelled for the remainder of this week. Online and alternative learning will launch Monday, March 16, for undergraduate, graduate and professional students. Faculty and graduate assistants should coordinate directly with their deans and department chairs, and staff with their managers, with questions.</p>
<p>Be assured that <strong>our campus remains safe and open. </strong>We are continuing our cleaning, sanitizing, social distancing and other best practices to keep our campus safe.</p>
<p>I know this news will raise many questions specific to your situation. <strong>We are now preparing detailed information, guidance and resources for all students, faculty, staff and postdoctoral scholars.</strong> We will share that information as soon as it is available.</p>
<p>This is not how any of us wanted this semester to proceed, but we are acting now to ensure the health and safety of all members of our community. While our campus is the heart of this university, our people are its soul. This challenging situation is necessitating a temporary change to how we deliver education, but it will not deter us from the pursuit of our mission.</p>
<p>I remind you that all of the rest of our policies and guidelines remain in place. Please closely monitor the <a href="http://vu.edu/coronavirus">university’s COVID-19 website</a>—all updates, policies and a detailed FAQ will continue to be posted to that site. <a href="https://www.vanderbilt.edu/coronavirus/questions/">Contact covid-questions@vanderbilt.edu</a> with questions.</p>
<p>With much appreciation,</p>
<p>Susan R. Wente</p>
<p>Interim Chancellor and Provost</p>
