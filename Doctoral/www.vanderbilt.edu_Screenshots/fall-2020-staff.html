												<p>Vanderbilt&#8217;s staff are vital to the university&#8217;s function and elevate its research and educational mission. Since the university transitioned to online and alternative learning in March, work has looked different for many staff members, including those who have transitioned to remote work and those who have been critical to supporting students who have had to remain on campus.</p>
<h5>Three things you need to know</h5>
<ul>
<li>The undergraduate and graduate academic calendar has been adjusted to a <strong>start date of August 24</strong>, with <strong>in-person classes ending by Thanksgiving</strong> and <strong>exams conducted remotely</strong>. <a href="https://www.vanderbilt.edu/coronavirus/fall-2020/fall-2020-resources/fall-2020-graduate-and-professional-academic-calendars/">View graduate and professional student calendars.</a></li>
<li>The university is taking actions—such as <strong>enhanced cleaning protocols, changes to foot-traffic flow through buildings and on campus pathways</strong>, and much more—to ensure all campus spaces and buildings support the health and safety of the entire Vanderbilt community.</li>
<li>Staff will be recalled to campus in an orderly fashion in support of core mission activities (on-campus research, on-campus instruction, undergraduate residential living and learning). <strong>Staff will be informed by their supervisors when and under what circumstances they are to return to work on campus and should not return until authorized.</strong></li>
</ul>

<h4>FALL SEMESTER DINING</h4>
<p>Campus Dining is adapting its operations to the new reality of physical distancing, enhanced sanitization protocols, and modified service style. While our dining facilities may look different, know that our focus on the safety and well-being of the Vanderbilt community has never been stronger.</p>
<p>Despite the myriad challenges posed by this public health event, Campus Dining is fully committed to providing a wide variety of healthy and nutritious meal options to the Vanderbilt community. In addition to a network of residential dining halls, retail markets, and cafes, we are proud to announce the following enhancements to our dining program for the 2020-2021 academic year:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>Nicholas S. Zeppos College dining hall</strong> will be opening in August 2020 and adds another option to the Vanderbilt West End neighborhood.</li>
<li>Broad expansion of <strong>mobile ordering options</strong>, including all Munchie Mart convenience stores and Suzie’s Cafes. Students will have the option to use meals or meal money in these locations. Options include a rotating menu of chef-inspired sandwiches, wraps, and healthy bowls, in addition to market and convenience items.</li>
<li>To further support physical distancing efforts, and to reduce congestion in high-traffic dining halls, Campus Dining <strong>Pick-up Spots</strong> will be located in key places across campus; students can order meals online, then pick up at a convenient location.</li>
<li>Students can use their Meal Money or Commodore Cash to purchase food at any one of the Taste of Nashville partner restaurants, all located near campus. In addition, Campus Dining will host a rotation of <strong>food trucks</strong> on a daily basis, further adding value and variety to a student’s Meal Money or Commodore Cash.</li>
</ul>

Our award-winning chefs are proud to offer a comprehensive meal plan that supports <strong>community, sustainability and healthy living</strong>.</p>

<p>Nonresidential students, including undergraduates opting out of on-campus housing, will have the ability to purchase any of the above meal plans, but will not be required to do so. In addition, nonresidential students, faculty, and staff have the option to purchase flex meals which are prepaid blocks of meals, redeemable at any Campus Dining location.</p>
<p>These are unprecedented times, and terms such as &#8220;physical distancing&#8221; and &#8220;the new normal&#8221; have become part of our everyday lexicon. Vanderbilt, like most institutions, has adapted in significant and profound ways.

As an integral component of campus life, Campus Dining takes pride in fueling our students’ academic pursuits, and we look forward to serving you soon.</p>

Where applicable, your Vanderbilt card/badge is required for entry to all buildings, and you may not hold or prop open exterior doors for any other person. After entering a building, sanitize your hands at the nearest sanitizer station and follow signage and all physical distancing guidelines outlined herein.</p>
<p>The university will identify suitable building access points. In alignment with <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/office-buildings.html">CDC employer guidance</a>, where appropriate, departments and building coordinators should attempt to coordinate arrival and departure times of faculty, staff, postdocs and students to reduce congestion during typical “rush hours” of a day’s schedule. For example, staff arrival and departures should be scheduled in 15-minute increments to reduce personal interactions at building access points, hallways, stairs/elevators, etc. Staggered schedules should be considered for lunch and break times.</p>
<p>Once you have been authorized to return to campus, you should arrive and depart campus through the designated building access points. Staff should also report at the designated time, where applicable, to limit the number of people entering and exiting buildings at any one time.</p>
<p>Building entrance and exit points are being mapped for every building on campus, including ADA accessible circulation. In alignment with <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/office-buildings.html">CDC</a> and <a href="https://acha-test.app.box.com/s/k202537ahi3w27b0w6cdhqxynr3vljif">ACHA</a> guidance, buildings will include <a href="https://www.vanderbilt.edu/coronavirus/faqs/interior-and-exterior-covid-signage/">signage and visual markers</a>, including directional signage signifying flow, physical distancing signage showing where people should stand (in certain buildings), and informational signage regarding protocols in the Return to Campus Plan. Be mindful of following the <a href="https://www.vanderbilt.edu/coronavirus/faqs/interior-and-exterior-covid-signage/">directional signage</a>, and be prepared to change your daily routine to adhere to the new circulation patterns. As building maps are finalized, they will be added to the list below.</p>
<p>Buildings in which <a href="https://www.vanderbilt.edu/coronavirus/faqs/interior-and-exterior-covid-signage/">signage and visual markers</a> have been installed will also be noted in the list below with this symbol <i class="fa fa-location-arrow" aria-hidden="true">&nbsp;</i>.</p>
<p>Please contact your building manager or facility officer with any questions or feedback on these plans.</p>

Physical distancing and face mask/covering wearing is especially important for people who are at higher risk.</p>
<h4>Everyone on campus should follow these physical distancing practices:</h4>
<p><a href="https://www.vanderbilt.edu/coronavirus/faqs/safety-guidance-physical-distancing/">Physical distancing practices</a> and <a href="https://www.vanderbilt.edu/coronavirus/faqs/face-masks/">face mask/covering wearing</a> should be followed in all outdoor spaces.</p>
<p>In the interest of creating a culture where health and safety are promoted and realized, face masks/coverings must be worn by all individuals on campus in public settings (e.g., common workspaces, hallways, stairwells, elevators, meeting rooms, classrooms, break-rooms, campus outdoor spaces, restrooms, etc.). Appropriate use of face masks/coverings is important in minimizing risk to the wearer and those around them. A face mask/covering is not a substitute for physical distancing.</p>
<h4>Goals for outdoor spaces on campus include:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Creating an environment that maximizes safety and legibility while moving through campus</li>
<li>Making it possible on major routes to maintain a 6-foot distance while moving through campus</li>
<li>Using minimally invasive, maximally effective techniques</li>
<li>Designing all indoor and outdoor circulation plans with accessibility and mobility needs in mind</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://www.vanderbilt.edu/coronavirus/faqs/interior-and-exterior-covid-signage/">Wayfinding</a> will be phased in aligned with the Vanderbilt Return to Campus phases. This allows for the university to observe and adjust. The university is aiming to give people room and give people time to react.</p>
<p>The “Gold Path” network is a planning concept Vanderbilt is using to focus its wayfinding and signage efforts and coordinate with similar efforts within buildings. Paths designated as part of the “Gold Path” represent commonly used pedestrian paths. As the community continues to return to campus, the university will place its signage and monitoring efforts on these corridors.</p>
<p>Signage has been prepared aligned with <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/office-buildings.html">CDC</a> and <a href="https://acha-test.app.box.com/s/k202537ahi3w27b0w6cdhqxynr3vljif">ACHA</a> guidance and will be placed along the “Gold Path” network. Be mindful to follow the <a href="https://www.vanderbilt.edu/coronavirus/faqs/interior-and-exterior-covid-signage/">directional signage</a> and be prepared to change your daily routine to adhere to the new circulation patterns.</p>
<p>The following map shows the “Gold Path” network for the current university Phase 2.  Parking locations are noted with non-colored circles and popular destinations with colored circles. Major circulation routes are noted in gold.</p>

<p>Based on <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/colleges-universities/considerations.html">CDC college and university</a> and <a href="https://acha-test.app.box.com/s/k202537ahi3w27b0w6cdhqxynr3vljif">ACHA</a> guidance, convening in groups carries a high risk of viral transmission. Gathering sizes are governed by university restrictions determined at each phase. Where feasible, meetings should be held in whole or in part using online collaboration tools (e.g., Zoom). When allowed, in-person meetings are limited to the restrictions of gathering sizes, assuming individuals can still maintain 6 feet of separation for physical distancing requirements. Departments should remove or rearrange chairs and tables (e.g., consider staggering seats) or add visual cue marks in meeting rooms to support physical distancing practices between attendees. During your time on site, you are encouraged to communicate with your colleagues and supervisors as needed by email, Skype messenger, telephone or other technology. You can also use a range of available collaboration tools (e.g., Zoom).</p>
<h4>GATHERINGS</h4>
<p>Vanderbilt is currently in phase 2 of its ramp-up, and gatherings up to 10 people are allowed as long as <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/prevention.html">CDC</a>-recommended physical distancing can be maintained, and safety protocols (e.g., face masks/coverings) are followed. Changes to gathering size restrictions will be communicated as the university continues to ramp up operations and prior to the start of the fall semester. Changes will be evaluated based on state, city and health guidance.</p>
<p>A definition of gatherings will be available by July 1.</p>

It is our shared duty as a community to act responsibly. Individuals who do not live in Vanderbilt housing must be free of ANY symptoms related to COVID-19 to be on campus or participate in activities on campus.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/symptoms-testing/symptoms.html">According to the CDC</a>, symptoms may appear 2 to 14 days after exposure to the virus. These symptoms or combinations of symptoms include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fever or chills</li>
<li>Cough</li>
<li>Shortness of breath or difficulty breathing</li>
<li>Fatigue</li>
<li>Muscle or body aches</li>

<li>Sore throat</li>
<li>Congestion or runny nose</li>
<li>Nausea or vomiting</li>
<li>Diarrhea</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>If faculty, staff or postdocs develop any symptoms, they should call the Vanderbilt <a href="https://www.vumc.org/health-wellness/occupational-health">Occupational Health</a> Clinic and notify their supervisor/department chair that they are reviewing their health status prior to the start of any scheduled work period or time on campus;</strong> Occupational Health will instruct the individual on appropriate next steps (medical appointment, self-isolation, clearance to report, etc.). For staff, time spent in dialogue with Occupational Health is not considered working time.</p>
<p>While a symptom-monitoring app is not mandatory at this time, a symptom-monitoring tool has been created within the existing <a href="https://police.vanderbilt.edu/services/vandysafe.php">VandySafe</a> app for daily self-monitoring.</p>
<p>New features of the <a href="https://police.vanderbilt.edu/services/vandysafe.php">VandySafe</a> app include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Self-Assessment Tool: users are provided recommended actions based on answers to a series of guided questions</li>
<li>Return to Campus Plan</li>
<li>Vanderbilt University COVID-19 Updates</li>
<li>Report a Concern</li>
<li>Support Services</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Faculty, staff, or postdocs who have any symptoms must present to a VUMC COVID-19 assessment site.</strong></p>
<p><strong>For those who work in a higher-risk environment for infection with COVID-19 (e.g., some research facilities, VUPS, dining, child care, etc.), your department may require temperature  and symptom screening upon arrival to work.</strong> Your supervisor will advise you on this requirement prior to your return to campus and on where to report when you arrive for screening. Temperature screening on campus allows the university to know immediately if someone is symptomatic so that they can be directed to the VUMC COVID Hotline at 888-312-0847 for coordination of testing. As with all other absences, the faculty/staff/postdoc is responsible for informing their supervisor/mentor/dean. All persons conducting temperature screening will be trained in advance and will be required to wear personal protective equipment as appropriate.</p>
<p>In order to ensure compliance with privacy laws, records of temperature screenings or symptom assessments should not be maintained by departments. Departments may note that a staff member was not able to work on a given day(s) because they could not be cleared to work. <strong>Anyone with symptoms must self-isolate until testing results are back.</strong> If the results are negative, the person may return to campus without any formal clearance.</p>
<p>Any questions regarding the assessment process can be directed to Occupational Health (615-936-0955).</p>

<p>Faculty, staff and postdocs who have symptoms related to COVID-19 or determine that they need to be tested based on potential exposure are encouraged to call Occupational Health at 615-936-0955. Individuals who need emergency care should contact 911 for ambulance transport to the nearest Emergency Department.</p>
<p>Individuals who have symptoms or may have been exposed and are off campus may contact Occupational Health or may also contact their primary care provider for COVID-19 testing locations in their area.</p>
<p>If a faculty member, staff member, or postdoc believes they have contracted COVID-19 after exposure to a known COVID-positive person on campus and/or while performing job duties, health care professionals may direct the individual to complete a First Report of Work Injury or Illness. The individual who has been exposed must stop work immediately and leave campus, even if the individual is not showing symptoms. The individual is required to notify their supervisor that they are leaving and notify Occupational Health that they have been exposed and/or developed symptoms. An individual awaiting test results must remain at home in self-isolation and keep their supervisor/mentor/dean informed of their return-to-campus status.</p>
<p>At the current time, asymptomatic testing is not routinely recommended by either <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/shared-congregate-house/index.html">CDC</a>and the<a href="https://acha-test.app.box.com/s/k202537ahi3w27b0w6cdhqxynr3vljif">ACHA</a> for faculty, staff, or post-docs who live in apartment-style housing or single-family homes instead of residence halls.  The Metro Nashville Public Health Department is offering free asymptomatic testing to anyone who wants it at their testing sites available at <a href="https://www.asafenashville.org/">asafenashville.org</a>.</p>
<p>Insurance provider Aetna is taking significant steps in response to COVID-19. Effective immediately, Aetna will waive co-pays and member cost share for all diagnostic testing related to COVID-19. This will cover the test kit for patients who meet CDC guidelines for testing, which can be performed in any approved laboratory location.</p>
<p><a class="c-link" href="https://www.aetna.com/individuals-families/member-rights-resources/need-to-know-coronavirus.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Learn more</a> on the Aetna website, or contact HR at <a class="c-link" href="mailto:human.resources@vanderbilt.edu" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">human.resources@vanderbilt.edu</a>.<span class="c-message__edited_label" dir="ltr"> </span></p>
<h4>Positive Case and Contact Tracing</h4>
<p>Faculty, staff, postdocs who test positive for COVID-19 must self-isolate at home and follow current CDC guidance. To help determine the risk of potential exposure to co-workers and others on campus, Occupational Health will conduct contact tracing with the individual who has tested positive. Exposed individuals will be given the name of the individual who tested positive so that their risk can be assessed. Occupational Health may contact the supervisor if further contact tracing of the COVID-19 positive individual is needed; however, the actual test result (and any other protected health information) will not be disclosed.</p>
<p>Individuals who have been exposed to a COVID-19 positive person are entered into Occupational Health’s symptom monitoring survey that is completed daily. The objective is to inform individuals of known exposures and to closely monitor each individual to ensure that any signs of infection are addressed early.</p>
<p>Vanderbilt is following CDC’s recommended recovery strategy. If an individual had symptoms, recovery status (and clearance to return to campus/work) is assigned when: 1) the individual remains fever-free without the use of fever reducers for 72 hours, 2) symptoms have improved, and 3) it has been at least 10 days since their symptoms first appeared. If the individual tested positive for COVID-19 but had no symptoms, the individual can be cleared to return 10 days after the test as long as the individual does not develop symptoms. If the individual develops symptoms, then the individual must follow the recovery strategy for those with symptoms. Notification for return to on-campus activities is directed through Occupational Health.</p>

If physical distancing is possible, individuals working in private offices or laboratory environments that do not otherwise require face masks/coverings may remove their face masks/coverings while in such spaces. Appropriate use of face masks/coverings is important in minimizing risks to the wearers and those around them according to both <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/diy-cloth-face-coverings.html">CDC</a> and <a href="https://acha-test.app.box.com/s/k202537ahi3w27b0w6cdhqxynr3vljif">ACHA</a> guidance. You could spread COVID-19 to others even if you do not feel sick. The face mask/covering is not a substitute for physical distancing. This applies to off-site and leased building space, as well as on the main Vanderbilt campus, both indoors and outdoors.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.2rem">Each faculty member, staff member, postdoc and student will be provided with one cloth face covering. Disposable masks will be provided, if needed. Individuals and departments can contact their assigned building manager or liaison in their college, school or department to acquire cloth face coverings or disposable masks. You also may wear homemade cloth face coverings that adhere to CDC and other public health recommendations. This will help Vanderbilt reduce the need to purchase additional masks, which are in short supply. A disposable mask must not be used for more than one day.

Throughout the pandemic, Plant Operations has monitored and adopted CDC recommendations.</p>
<p>The CDC’s “<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/colleges-universities/considerations.html">Considerations for Institutes of Higher Education</a>,” May 30 updated guidance specifically recommends routine disinfecting and cleaning of surfaces and objects that are frequently touched using the cleaners typically used, according to the directions on the label. The CDC says that most common EPA-registered <a href="https://www.epa.gov/pesticide-registration/list-n-disinfectants-use-against-sars-cov-2-covid-19">household disinfectants</a> should be effective.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">At a minimum, there will be twice daily disinfecting of high-touch areas throughout campus. Classrooms will be disinfected daily during routine cleaning. Disinfecting wipes will be provided in classrooms and other spaces for use by the occupants. Facilities is also implementing zone-based disinfectant teams who will be easily identifiable.</span></p>
<p>Facilities will follow <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/disinfecting-building-facility.html">CDC guidelines</a> <span style="font-size: 1.2rem">for cleaning of outdoor areas, which calls for routine cleaning.</span></p>
<p>Plant Operations staff received cleaning and disinfection protocols training at the onset of the pandemic and will attend future training sessions on the latest protocols. In accordance with CDC and university guidelines, all staff members will wear the required personal protective equipment including face masks/coverings while on campus.</p>
<p>In addition to normal cleaning routines, custodial staff will also disinfect frequently touched surfaces or high-touch points and objects using EPA approved products. Examples of frequently touched surfaces and objects that will receive the minimal twice-daily disinfection are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tables in common spaces</li>
<li>Doorknobs</li>
<li>Light switches</li>
<li>Door handles</li>
<li>Hand railings</li>
<li>Bathroom stalls</li>
<li>Sink handles</li>
<li>Grab bars</li>
<li>Water fountains</li>
</ul>
<p>Cleaning services for public/common spaces such as restrooms, lounges, lobbies, and hallways will be increased. Other duties such as emptying trash, vacuuming/cleaning of floors of private offices once per week will continue. Otherwise, cleaning/disinfecting of private offices and work areas will be the responsibility of occupants.</p>
<p>The following will NOT be cleaned by custodial staff.</p>
<ul>
<li>Desks</li>
<li>Keyboards</li>
<li>Touch screens</li>
<li>Remote controls</li>
</ul>
<p>Disposable wipes will be made available through each school/college’s and department’s building or facilities officer so that commonly used surfaces and objects can be wiped down before use. For soft surfaces such as carpeted floors or fabric in seating areas, guidance indicates to continue cleaning with cleaners appropriate for use on these surfaces and disinfecting with appropriate product for the specific surfaces; vacuum carpets as usual.</p>
<h3>Hand Sanitizing Products and Touchless Features</h3>
<ul>
<li>Hand sanitizing stations will be located at key areas within all campus buildings.</li>
<li>Sanitizing products such as hand pumps and wipes will be available at key locations (ingress/egress, elevator lobbies, etc.) and can be obtained through each school/college’s and department’s building or facilities officer.</li>
<li>Foot pulls will be installed on doors of high-use areas such as restrooms.</li>
<li>Plant Operations will gradually replace hand-operated paper towels and soap dispensers with touchless products in restrooms.</li>
</ul>
<p>These practices will continue to evolve as the CDC releases new recommendations.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.epa.gov/coronavirus/frequent-questions-about-indoor-air-and-coronavirus-covid-19">guidance</a> from these sources is very similar and falls into three basic categories:</p>
<ul>
<li>Increasing the amount of outside air being delivered to spaces</li>
<li>Using high-efficiency filtration in systems that circulate air around large numbers of spaces</li>
<li>Maintaining temperature and humidity levels within spaces</li>
</ul>
<p>The university is implementing strategies to comply with these guidelines. The Facilities Department is also working to implement an overnight cycle during which buildings are flushed with an increased volume of outside air without exceeding the heating and cooling system capacities.</p>
<p>The Facilities Department will continue to adhere to <a href="https://www.ashrae.org/technical-resources/filtration-disinfection#mechanical">ASHRAE published guidance</a> for safe and healthy buildings, which emphasizes increased fresh-air ventilation and close management of indoor air quality, temperature and humidity.</p>
<p>To keep the Vanderbilt community as healthy as possible, indoor conditions will be maintained at temperatures ranging from 68 to 76 degrees and relative humidity of 45 to 50 percent.</p>
<p>Although the university is implementing these extra safety measures, it is up to each member of the Vanderbilt community to practice <a href="https://www.vanderbilt.edu/coronavirus/faqs/safety-guidance-physical-distancing/">physical distancing</a>, <a href="https://www.vanderbilt.edu/coronavirus/faqs/handwashing/">washing or sanitizing hands</a>, and using <a href="https://www.vanderbilt.edu/coronavirus/faqs/face-masks/">face masks/coverings</a> in all public spaces on campus to limit the spread of COVID-19, as recommended by the CDC.</p>

Physical distancing is especially important for people who are at higher risk. Individuals on campus should follow these physical distancing practices:</p>
<ul>
<li>Stay at least 6 feet (about 2 arms’ length) from other people.</li>
<li>Do not gather in groups.</li>
<li>Stay out of crowded places and avoid mass gatherings.</li>

<p>Compliance serves as an important aspect of the Return to Campus Plan, reminding campus community members of their responsibilities in helping to reduce the spread of COVID-19. With the understanding that campus life will look very different with compliance in place, guidelines have been developed to promote the health and safety of the campus community as much as possible.</p>
<h4>ADDRESSING NONCOMPLIANCE</h4>
<p>Students, faculty, staff and postdocs will be expected to comply with all university policies and protocols designed to reduce the spread of COVID-19 infection and promote the health and safety of the Vanderbilt and Nashville communities.</p>
<p>Intentional or reckless disregard for these policies and protocols by students will be addressed through the Office of Student Accountability, Community Standards, and Academic Integrity, using the existing sanctioning considerations found in the <em>Student Handbook,</em> including by reviewing the potential impact on the community in the evaluation of the nature and severity of the incident, which may support an enhanced sanction.</p>
<p>The Vanderbilt <em>Faculty Manual</em> provides that faculty may be disciplined for violations of the university’s standards of conduct. The process for reaching a decision to discipline a faculty member is overseen by the dean in consultation with the provost.</p>
<p>The university’s progressive discipline policy states that a staff member can be disciplined for violations of protocols and procedures governing safety. The policy outlines a process for correcting single and repeat episodes of employee failure to comply with rules. Safety violations will be handled under this process.</p>

<p>As we confront this health crisis, Vanderbilt University will remain steadfast in the constant pursuit of our mission and ideals outlined in the Academic Strategic Plan. Therefore, the university will ramp up in phases with primary mission activities at the heart of all decision making. Mission-centric activities are any required on-campus activities that fulfill Vanderbilt’s core mission of teaching and research.</p>
<p>Radically different ways of deploying VU campus resources, including physical spaces, will be necessary as part of establishing a new normal. As we move forward, flexibility will be critical. Vanderbilt University’s return to learning and discovering on campus will occur in phases of increased activity and will involve the careful evaluation of data, models and public health recommendations. Protocols will be pragmatic and will evolve over time.</p>
<p>Vanderbilt University’s plans for expanding operations and increasing the presence of faculty, staff and students will be guided by the following criteria:</p>
<ul>
<li>The intentional effort by all faculty, staff and students to exercise both personal and community responsibility. The combined efforts by all members of the Vanderbilt community will create a culture that sustains a healthy and safe on-campus environment.</li>
<li>Existing and projected government restrictions (e.g., safer-at-home orders, masking requirements, physical distancing, gatherings, etc.).</li>
<li>Public health status: recommendations from the federal government (recently released Opening Guidelines), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and Vanderbilt University Medical Center.</li>
<li>Resource availability, including personal protective equipment for students, faculty and staff.</li>
<li>Contact tracing and case management protocols.</li>
<li>Physical distancing strategies.</li>
<li>Financial feasibility.</li>
<li>Alignment with Vanderbilt’s strategic framework that the ramp-up of on-campus activities will support primary mission objectives of the institution (on-campus research, on-campus teaching and instruction, on-campus residential living and learning).</li>
</ul>
<p>Vanderbilt University’s plans will also take into account local orders and ordinances of the City of Nashville, Davidson County and the Nashville Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA), as well as the State of Tennessee’s “Tennessee Pledge: Reopening Tennessee Responsibly.”</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.asafenashville.org/roadmap-for-reopening-nashville/">Roadmap for Reopening Nashville</a> follows a four-phase approach. The Vanderbilt University Return to Campus Plan acknowledges the triggers and phases of ramp-up for the city in which Vanderbilt is located and identifies which activities ramp up on campus and when. The Vanderbilt University activities that will ramp up are identified below in each corresponding phase. <strong>Vanderbilt’s ramp-up may lag the Nashville ramp-up and will be tailored to our own unique density, operations, and other considerations as a residential education institution.</strong> The university will communicate with the VU community in advance of each phase. If metrics of COVID-19 transmission and health system capacity change significantly, and Metro Nashville returns to a prior phase, Vanderbilt may also return to a prior phase and re-impose restrictions on activities.</p>

Individuals will return to campus based on the core activities they support and their demonstrated need to be on campus. No one should return to campus without authorization.</p>
<p>These efforts will be tightly coordinated to mitigate potential risks and ensure the safety of our campus community and the other communities we serve. No unit or department should increase authorized levels beyond current needs to support critical on-site operations and activities without approval from the appropriate dean or vice chancellor. Once decisions to expand on-site levels of return in certain areas are made, individuals should follow the campuswide policies and protocols detailed in this guide for returning to work on campus.</p>
<p>Compliance with the policies and protocols outlined on this website, as well as those from your supervisor/mentor/dean, is required for continued access; violation (e.g., blatant disregard for infection prevention measures) may result in the immediate revocation of building access privileges, disciplinary action, and/or other interventions.</p>

Staff will be informed by their supervisors when and under what circumstances they are to return to work on campus and should not return until authorized.</p>
<h4>REMOTE WORK</h4>
<p>Those who can work remotely to fulfill their work responsibilities should continue to do so to limit the number of individuals on campus and the spread of the COVID-19 virus. <strong>Remote work arrangements must be approved by the immediate supervisor</strong> and can be accomplished on a full or partial day/week schedule as appropriate.</p>
<h4>ALTERNATING DAYS OR ALTERNATING WEEKS</h4>
<p>Based on <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/office-buildings.html">CDC employer</a> and <a href="https://acha-test.app.box.com/s/k202537ahi3w27b0w6cdhqxynr3vljif">ACHA</a> guidance, to limit the number of individuals and interactions on campus, departments should consider scheduling partial staffing on alternating days or weeks with staff who are required on campus (e.g., two weeks remote, two weeks on campus OR one week on campus, three weeks remote). Such scheduling will enable physical distancing, especially in areas with large common workspaces. To contain “germ circles,” it is best to schedule the same people on the same days to limit any one individual’s exposure to other individuals when possible.</p>
<h4>STAGGERED REPORTING/DEPARTING</h4>
<p>Based on <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/office-buildings.html">CDC employer</a> and <a href="https://acha-test.app.box.com/s/k202537ahi3w27b0w6cdhqxynr3vljif">ACHA</a> guidance, the beginning and end of the workday typically bring many people together at common entry/exit points of buildings. Staggering reporting and departure times by at least 15 minutes will reduce traffic in common areas to meet physical distancing requirements. (See <a href="https://www.vanderbilt.edu/coronavirus/faqs/entry-exit-control/">Indoor and Outdoor Spaces: Entry/exit controls</a> for further details.)</p>
