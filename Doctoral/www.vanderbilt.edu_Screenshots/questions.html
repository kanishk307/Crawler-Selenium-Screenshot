<p>In-person, on-campus undergraduate classes will begin on Monday, August 24, and will conclude on Friday, November 20. All undergraduate students will complete the final week of classes and then take final exams remotely through virtual and alternative platforms, with the semester concluding on Sunday, December 13.</p>
<p>There will be no fall break this year. In addition, we ask that students stay in the Nashville area and not travel away from campus for weekend trips through the end of in-person classes on Friday, November 20. <a href="https://www.vanderbilt.edu/coronavirus/travel-information/">Read more on travel here.</a></p>
<p>Undergraduate residential students who are able to do so will leave campus for the Thanksgiving holiday and will not return to campus until the start of the spring semester. We are adopting this plan based on current public health guidance regarding risks associated with coming and going to and from campus, and models suggesting a potential resurgence of COVID-19 cases with the onset of influenza season.</p>

<h5>Orientation</h5>
<p>All orientation will be conducted virtually. There will be several prerecorded modules that students can access online at their convenience.

<p>Our framework for holding in-person classes on campus this fall is supported by several components, including the continued need for physical distancing, the need to continue pursuing virtual and alternative teaching methods (even in the event of in-person classes) for all classes and the understanding that many curricular decisions will need to be made on a local level, taking into account the unique standards and expectations across our different schools and colleges.</p>
<p>We must continue to plan for a hybrid teaching model that includes a combination of in-person, virtual and alternative learning methods. This approach accommodates members of our community—including both faculty and students—who will not be able to return to campus because of travel and visa restrictions as well as health concerns and other personal concerns.</p>
<p><strong>Decisions and discussions regarding courses that will fully need to be taught using virtual and alternative platforms should be made in your colleges and schools.</strong> Adaptive learning could include implementing a variety of techniques from postings of lecture recordings to leveraging on-campus recording spaces for asynchronous instructional videos. To support faculty, we have increased resources including enhancing and expanding classroom IT, <a href="https://cft.vanderbilt.edu">CFT resources</a>. Soon faculty will have access to instructional design experts through iDesign (coming soon).

Classrooms will be <strong>disinfected daily</strong> during routine cleaning. <strong>Disinfecting wipes will be provided in classrooms</strong> and other spaces for use by the occupants.</li>
<li><strong>Physical distancing of 6 feet</strong> will be implemented resulting in reduced in-person <strong>class sizes</strong> and/or rescheduling for spaces large enough to support physical distancing. We are exploring other classroom hygiene approaches, but all will have restrictions on distance between the lecturer and the audience.</li>
<li><strong>Class scheduling</strong> will be adjusted to allow for more time for students and faculty to travel from one class to another.</li>
<li>When feasible, <strong>dedicated entrances and exits</strong> will be designated to minimize congestion during class changes.</li>
<li>Hand sanitizer dispensers will be placed at entrance and exit points for buildings on campus, as well as near elevators.</li>
<li>Doors will be automated, where possible.</li>
</ul>
<p>Each faculty member, staff member, postdoc and student will be provided a cloth face covering. Disposable masks will be provided, if needed. Individuals and departments can contact their assigned facilities officer or liaison in their college, school or department to acquire cloth face coverings or disposable masks. You may also wear homemade cloth face coverings that adhere to CDC and other public health recommendations.</p>
<p>A number of classroom protocols are being finalized through careful study and close consultation with experts at Vanderbilt University Medical Center and our School of Nursing, as well as national, state and local public health officials. Academic leaders, faculty and students are all contributing to determining those protocols. This includes examining the use of face shields, Plexiglas and more. Deans will share additional details by July 1.</p>

<p>Researchers often need access to original, primary source materials. So far, the library has been able to provide e-texts or scans for 83.2 percent of all requests. The university has invested resources to increase accessibility, and library staff have scanned thousands of items, so that many items that were unavailable previously are now available digitally.</p>
<p>Vanderbilt Libraries will follow university guidelines and current CDC public health recommendations in order to create the safest space possible for library staff and patrons.</p>
<p><strong>Gradual reopening of in-person library services</strong></p>
<p>Phase 1: A small group of library staff returned to the Central Library, and pick-up started on June 1, limited to the Central and Divinity libraries.</p>
<p>Phase 2: We will be expanding the number of pick-up and drop-off locations for faculty who are unable to access materials digitally. We will increase staff in order to 1) get items processed for the end of the fiscal year; 2) check in and shelve items returned to the various departmental libraries; 3) prepare for special collections users in Phase 3; 4) begin to scan and digitize more items; 5) work on reserves requests; and 6) generally get ready for the fall semester. We will also start preparing for user access which will start in Phase 3.</p>
<p>Phase 3: We will allow access to researchers. Also, the library directors are currently working to ensure that each library building has an approved circulation pattern and that user areas are set up to ensure social distancing protocols are followed. We are also working to reconfigure space in the libraries to use as additional classroom and instructional space.</p>

Given COVID-19 conditions, this means we will de-densify residential spaces to provide housing that is as safe as possible. We are also identifying self-isolation and quarantine locations for members of our residential community.</span></span><span class="EOP SCXW82736291 BCX0"> </span></p>
<p>To meet these goals, we have customized plans for three cohorts of students with different on-campus living needs: first-year students, returning upper-division students, and student-athletes. We are deploying a mix of new approaches, including authorizing more upper-division students to live off campus and securing additional Vanderbilt-controlled housing options near campus.</p>
<p>Public health guidance recommends students reside either in single rooms or in a family-unit model (roommates and suite mates considered a family unit are exempt from physical distancing) with bathroom considerations such as the student-to-fixture ratio and enhanced cleaning schedules.</p>
<p><strong><span class="TextRun SCXW257123699 BCX0" lang="EN" xml:lang="EN"><span class="NormalTextRun SCXW257123699 BCX0">Some rooms that we are reducing occupancy for will have two sets of furniture. We are not removing the excess furniture. Students should not bring their own furniture.</span></span></strong></p>
<p>Details regarding specific housing options and room assignment procedures will be communicated to students prior to the resumption of the housing assignment process, <b>which will begin on July 5, 2020. </b>We anticipate multiple move-in days this fall.<b> Move-in dates will also be announced in July.</b></p>
<h4>FIRST-YEAR STUDENTS</h4>
<p><b>First-year students will be assigned one student per room and will be housed in The Martha Rivers Ingram Commons, Branscomb Quadrangle and Carmichael Towers East using a random assignment process. Requests for specific residence halls will not be considered. </b><b>All first-year students will be housed in single rooms </b><b>in order to reduce the density in our residence halls.</b></p>
<p><b>First-year students will switch housing assignments at the transition between fall and spring semester</b>, so all first-year students are able to live on The Commons for part of the year. In the fall semester, half of the first-year students will reside on the Ingram Commons and the other half will reside in Branscomb Quadrangle or Carmichael Towers East. In the spring, their assignments will be reversed.</p>
<p>Regardless of where they live in the fall, all first-year students will be assigned a Commons house affiliation and Faculty Head of House. All students will also be supported by Residential Experience Area Coordinators, Graduate Area Coordinators and Resident Advisers.</p>
<p>Additionally, students will be assigned a “virtual roommate” (e.g., a student living on The Commons will be paired with a student living in Branscomb Quadrangle or Carmichael Towers East). V<span class="TextRun SCXW109104249 BCX0" lang="EN" xml:lang="EN"><span class="NormalTextRun SCXW109104249 BCX0">irtual roommates allow students to connect with another person across campus to create a larger sense of community for new students. It also gives them an opportunity to connect with that person before arriving on campus and throughout the first year, as students begin to build their network at Vanderbilt.</span></span><span class="EOP SCXW109104249 BCX0"> </span></p>
<p><strong>First-year housing assignments and virtual roommates will be announced on Monday, August 10. Instructions for move-in will be available at that time as well.</strong></p>
<h4>RETURNING UPPER-DIVISION STUDENTS</h4>
<p>Returning upper-division students who do not already have a room assignment, and who are seeking on-campus housing, will receive an assignment through the Housing Assignment Process. Pending space availability, students will be assigned as individuals to traditional singles or as groups—per the family unit model—to traditional doubles and apartments.</p>
<p>In response to the need for distancing and reduction of density, the university is lowering the number of occupants in Morgan and Lewis house, allowing family-unit models if students select and acquiring additional VU-controlled properties. Additionally, any upper-division student who does not want to live on campus, including those currently assigned to a residence hall, may request <a href="https://vanderbilt.datacenter.adirondacksolutions.com/VANDERBILT_THDSS_PROD/index.cfm">off-campus authorization</a>.</p>
<p>Upper-division residence halls for the 2020-2021 academic year will include Warren and Moore Colleges, Zeppos College, Carmichael Towers I, E. Bronson Ingram College, Cole, Tolman, McGill, McTyeire, Morgan, Lewis, Chaffin, Mayfield, and OHARE at the Village at Vanderbilt.</p>
<p>We will resume the housing assignment process on July 5, 2020. An updated <em>Guide to the Housing Assignment Process,</em> which will detail specific housing options and room assignment procedures, will be available to students in advance of that date.</p>
<h4>STUDENT ATHLETES</h4>
<p>Student-athletes (first year and upper division) will be housed together in Morgan House and Lewis House on Highland Quad per the family unit model, sharing rooms with teammates and classmates (e.g., first-year students with first-year students and upper-division students with upper-division students). First-year students will also be assigned an Ingram Commons house affiliation.</p>
<h4>TRANSFER STUDENTS</h4>
<p>Incoming transfer students seeking off-campus housing and roommates can use the <a href="https://offcampushousing.vanderbilt.edu/">Off-Campus Housing Service</a>. We will also provide <a href="https://www.vanderbilt.edu/transfer/">programming</a> to ensure transfer students are fully connected to and integrated with our community.</p>
<h4>QUARANTINE AND ISOLATION</h4>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Our plan for Vanderbilt-controlled housing for the 2020–21 academic year is student focused. COVID-19 conditions mean we needed to identify quarantine and isolation locations for our undergraduate residential community and to de-densify residential spaces to provide housing that is as safe as possible. </span><span class="s2">The</span><span class="s3"> CDC defines isolation as </span><span class="s2">separating</span><span class="s3"> sick people with a contagious disease </span><span class="s2">from</span><span class="s3"> people who are not sick and quarantine as separating and </span><span class="s2">restricting</span><span class="s3"> the movement of people who were exposed to a contagious disease to see if they become sick. </span></p>
<p><strong>Blakemore House (an on-campus residence hall) and Scarritt Bennett Center (an off-campus property operated by the university and located in close proximity to campus) will be used for campus resident isolation and quarantine space.</strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">University health officials will make medical determinations and assign campus residents to either diagnostic quarantine or COVID-positive isolation to sites specifically designated for these purposes. </span><span class="s1">University health officials will make medical evaluations and release campus residents from quarantine or isolation to return to their campus residence hall room when deemed medically appropriate.</span></p>

<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Student Health will work with all such students to do regular symptom monitoring and will hospitalize anyone who becomes seriously ill.</span></p>
<h4>SUPPORT FOR RESIDENTIAL STUDENTS</h4>
<p>We are developing a robust virtual programming/community building model lead by Residential Experience. Resident Advisers will do regular one-on-one communication with residents and provide resources to assist them. All first-year students will spend at least one semester on the Ingram Commons and will be assigned a Faculty Head when they live in either Branscomb or Towers. All first year students will also be assigned a virtual roommate. Additionally, our <a href="https://www.vanderbilt.edu/coronavirus/faqs/community-support/">Student Care Network</a> will be providing support if we receive information that a student is struggling with adjustment to these challenging times.</p>
<p>The university is implementing a number of practices to support the health and wellness of residential students. These practices include enhanced cleaning and sanitization, physical distancing guidelines for commons spaces, the de-densification of residence halls and the development of virtual programming models:</p>
<ul>
<li>In order to maintain lower density in residential spaces, students will only have access to their assigned residential building and floor; students are encouraged to socialize outdoors or in commons areas, while practicing physical distancing.</li>
<li>High touch areas like door handles and elevator buttons will be cleaned throughout the day. We are installing foot pulls or arm pulls on many doors within the residential building. Hand sanitizer stations will be posted at all building entrances, exits, and near elevators.</li>
<li><b>Common area</b> bathrooms will be cleaned twice a day. Bathrooms will have a standard cleaning in the morning and a deeper cleaning and sanitization in the evenings.</li>
<li>Common area spaces in the residence halls like study spaces and lounges will be open; to encourage physical distancing, we have rearranged furniture in those spaces. Students should follow posted guidelines that will help identify ways to yield to others and outline maximum capacity in various space.</li>
<li>Students will be expected to wear face masks in public spaces like hallways and common areas. In residential bathrooms, students should practice physical distancing and follow any additional posted guidelines for use.</li>
<li>We are developing a robust virtual programming/community building model lead by Residential Experience. Resident Advisers will do regular one-on-one communication with residents and provide resources to assist them.</li>
</ul>
<h4>CHANGES TO HOUSING ASSIGNMENTS</h4>
<p><span class="TextRun BCX0 SCXW182792382" lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US"><span class="NormalTextRun BCX0 SCXW182792382">In most cases, housing assignments will not be changed upon arrival. In some rare instances, students who already have a housing assignment for the fall semester may need to move based on their requests for housing accommodations and our ability to fulfill their needs in their currently assigned space. In other words, students may need to be moved so that we can honor their accommodation. The Housing Assignments office will be in contact with these students before the remainder of the Housing Assignment process begins on July 5, 2020. All housing assignments will be completed by early August at which point no changes will be made for the fall 2020 term. Upon arrival, students cannot request room changes until after the second week of classes and will only be granted if space is available.</span></span></p>
<h4>Off-Campus Authorization</h4>
<p>Upper-division students who previously applied for, and have <b>accepted</b> their off-campus authorization offer, may not apply to live on campus.</p>

<h4>UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS</h4>
<p>Each fall, the university welcomes a diverse cohort of more than 1,800 new undergraduate students, inviting them to join the Vanderbilt family by providing support in the transition process and showcasing the vast network of resources available to ensure success. All new undergraduates—first-year and transfer—participate in new student orientation and receive support from the Vanderbilt community.</p>
<p>Orientation for first-year and transfer students will be held virtually prior to arrival on campus and the start of fall classes. More information and an orientation schedule are forthcoming.</p>
<h4>GRADUATE AND PROFESSIONAL STUDENTS</h4>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Orientation planning for graduate and professional students is underway, but we anticipate that orientations will be provided in a remote format in advance of campus arrival.

<div class="panel-body">
<p>Student life on campus is an important part of the college experience. There is no denying that the ways in which we live, learn, interact and study will continue to evolve and change in the coming months. Many of these experiences will be new for all of us, and we fully understand that the dynamics of the fall semester may not be what any of us would desire or expect. We share in the feeling that there is a long road of uncertainty ahead, but the collaborative and caring culture of Vanderbilt positions us well to thoughtfully travel it together.</p>
<p>The Office of the Dean of Students will use the parameters and protocols set forth as a part of the university’s Return to Campus Plan as a basis for guidelines for student life on campus and will determine how staff and students will engage in various activities and programs.</p>
<h4>STUDENT PROGRAMMING AND ORGANIZATIONS</h4>
<p>With distancing measures in place, student life professionals across campus are engaging directly with students to receive input on the best ways to build virtual communities and implement programming for students. Several ideas that are in development are virtual sing-a-longs, board game tournaments, watch parties and meals. The university is also asking student organizations to come up with creative engagement plans that accommodate safety and other health-based protocols. Our current approach is designed to create living-learning environments that allow Vanderbilt’s values to thrive under COVID-19 conditions.</p>
<p><span class="TextRun BCX0 SCXW165102228" lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US"><span class="NormalTextRun BCX0 SCXW165102228">We continue to define what a gathering can look in the fall. We anticipate coming up with some guidelines specifically for performing groups that would allow for some rehearsals and performances, even if no audience can be present. We will strongly recommend that all events, even those that allow in-person attendance, livestream or provide some form of virtual viewing (Facebook Live, Zoom, YouTube, etc.). Our Production Services staff is gearing up to be able to do remote livestreaming of student organization events, allowing students who are not comfortable attending or who may be doing remote learning to still be able to watch.</span></span></p>
<h3>Student Involvement Fair</h3>
<p><span class="TextRun SCXW153689081 BCX0" lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US"><span class="NormalTextRun SCXW153689081 BCX0">We are currently evaluating how we will execute the student involvement fair. We will have some form of fair, but are still collecting input and feedback from students about how best to execute this event. In addition, we are looking more broadly about how we can introduce incoming first-year and transfer students to the many opportunities for involvement on campus.</span></span><span class="EOP SCXW153689081 BCX0"> </span></p>
<h3>Reserving Space</h3>
<p><span class="TextRun SCXW115920519 BCX0" lang="EN" xml:lang="EN"><span class="NormalTextRun SCXW115920519 BCX0">Student organizations will be able to reserve space, but we anticipate those spaces to be more limited. As soon as we have a better understanding of which rooms will be used as classrooms, we will be able to open reservations for student organizations. We will have specific physical distancing set-ups for all spaces and will follow all university guidelines.</span></span></p>
<h3>RELIGIOUS ORGANIZATIONS</h3>
<p><span class="TextRun SCXW155216462 BCX0" lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US"><span class="NormalTextRun SCXW155216462 BCX0">We hope to be able to provide some in-person gatherings in the fall for all student organizations, but would be subject to broader university guidelines and greater Davidson County guidelines. We will certainly work with our religious organizations to help facilitate any special needs they have if possible. For example, we will work with religious life leaders to find creative ways and alternative spaces to observe religious rituals (e.g. coordinating a larger meeting space to allow for physical distancing). </span></span><span class="EOP SCXW155216462 BCX0"> </span></p>
<h4>MEETINGS AND SOCIAL EVENTS</h4>
<p>Vanderbilt will follow a phased approach with restrictions on in-person meetings<br />
and social events on or off campus. Each of Vanderbilt’s phases will outline specific guidance on the protocols for face masks/coverings, physical distancing, symptom monitoring and testing, event allowances, occupation of student centers and residential housing, student engagement, the Student Care Network and the Project Safe Center.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Student life on and off campus will be subject to limitations on gatherings and residential programming will be modified to alternative/virtual formats. Student organizations will modify operations for service/work. Common area access will be restricted and cleaning protocols will be put in place.</span></p>
<p><span class="s1">Student organizations will be able to reserve space, but we anticipate those spaces to be more limited. As soon as we have a better understanding of which rooms will be used as classrooms, we will be able to open reservations for student organizations. </span></p>
<p><span class="s1">Vanderbilt currently allows gatherings of up to 10 people with physical distancing. As guidelines change, we will work closely with student organizations to plan events and activities accordingly. Meanwhile, we will work with student leaders to come up with creative ways to engage their organizations and broader university community virtually through various platforms. A best practices guide for operating virtually is being developed for student organizations and will be publicized as we get closer to the start of the fall semester.</span></p>
<h4>COMPLIANCE</h4>
<p>Student Accountability will oversee compliance. Students are expected to comply with all university policies and protocols designed to facilitate physical distancing, reduce the spread of COVID-19 and promote the health and safety as much as possible of the Vanderbilt and Nashville communities. Any intentional or reckless disregard for these policies and protocols will be addressed through the Office of Student Accountability, Community Standards, and Academic Integrity, using the existing sanctioning considerations found in the <em>Student Handbook</em>, including a review of the potential impact based on the nature and severity of the incident, which may support an enhanced sanction. This also applies to both unofficial on- and off-campus parties.</p>
<h4>SPRING EVENTS</h4>
<p><span class="TextRun SCXW202503351 BCX0" lang="EN" xml:lang="EN"><span class="NormalTextRun SCXW202503351 BCX0">Vanderbilt will follow a phased approach with restrictions on in-person meetings and social events.

<h4>FALL SEMESTER DINING</h4>
<p>Campus Dining is adapting its operations to the new reality of physical distancing, enhanced sanitization protocols, and modified service style. While our dining facilities may look different, know that our focus on the safety and well-being of the Vanderbilt community has never been stronger.</p>
<p>Despite the myriad challenges posed by this public health event, Campus Dining is fully committed to providing a wide variety of healthy and nutritious meal options to the Vanderbilt community. In addition to a network of residential dining halls, retail markets, and cafes, we are proud to announce the following enhancements to our dining program for the 2020-2021 academic year:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>Nicholas S. Zeppos College dining hall</strong> will be opening in August 2020 and adds another option to the Vanderbilt West End neighborhood.</li>
<li>Broad expansion of <strong>mobile ordering options</strong>, including all Munchie Mart convenience stores and Suzie’s Cafes. Students will have the option to use meals or meal money in these locations. Options include a rotating menu of chef-inspired sandwiches, wraps, and healthy bowls, in addition to market and convenience items.</li>
<li>To further support physical distancing efforts, and to reduce congestion in high-traffic dining halls, Campus Dining <strong>Pick-up Spots</strong> will be located in key places across campus; students can order meals online, then pick up at a convenient location.</li>
<li>Students can use their Meal Money or Commodore Cash to purchase food at any one of the Taste of Nashville partner restaurants, all located near campus. In addition, Campus Dining will host a rotation of <strong>food trucks</strong> on a daily basis, further adding value and variety to a student’s Meal Money or Commodore Cash.</li>
</ul>
<p>Ranked <strong>#7 Best Campus Food, 2020</strong> by the Princeton Review, Vanderbilt Campus Dining serves up a globally-inspired menu, with exciting new cuisines and healthy options that support a diverse array of dietary preferences and restrictions. Our award-winning chefs are proud to offer a comprehensive meal plan that supports <strong>community, sustainability and healthy living</strong>.</p>

<p>These are unprecedented times, and terms such as &#8220;physical distancing&#8221; and &#8220;the new normal&#8221; have become part of our everyday lexicon. Vanderbilt, like most institutions, has adapted in significant and profound ways. What won’t change, however, is our commitment to clean, safe dining facilities, convenient dining options, and excellent-quality food.

<p>Entry to buildings will be regulated and monitored in alignment with <a href="https://acha-test.app.box.com/s/k202537ahi3w27b0w6cdhqxynr3vljif">ACHA</a> guidance. Where applicable, your Vanderbilt card/badge is required for entry to all buildings, and you may not hold or prop open exterior doors for any other person. After entering a building, sanitize your hands at the nearest sanitizer station and follow signage and all physical distancing guidelines outlined herein.</p>
<p>The university will identify suitable building access points. In alignment with <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/office-buildings.html">CDC employer guidance</a>, where appropriate, departments and building coordinators should attempt to coordinate arrival and departure times of faculty, staff, postdocs and students to reduce congestion during typical “rush hours” of a day’s schedule. For example, staff arrival and departures should be scheduled in 15-minute increments to reduce personal interactions at building access points, hallways, stairs/elevators, etc. Staggered schedules should be considered for lunch and break times.</p>
<p>Once you have been authorized to return to campus, you should arrive and depart campus through the designated building access points. Staff should also report at the designated time, where applicable, to limit the number of people entering and exiting buildings at any one time.</p>
<p>Building entrance and exit points are being mapped for every building on campus, including ADA accessible circulation. In alignment with <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/office-buildings.html">CDC</a> and <a href="https://acha-test.app.box.com/s/k202537ahi3w27b0w6cdhqxynr3vljif">ACHA</a> guidance, buildings will include <a href="https://www.vanderbilt.edu/coronavirus/faqs/interior-and-exterior-covid-signage/">signage and visual markers</a>, including directional signage signifying flow, physical distancing signage showing where people should stand (in certain buildings), and informational signage regarding protocols in the Return to Campus Plan. Be mindful of following the <a href="https://www.vanderbilt.edu/coronavirus/faqs/interior-and-exterior-covid-signage/">directional signage</a>, and be prepared to change your daily routine to adhere to the new circulation patterns. As building maps are finalized, they will be added to the list below.</p>
<p>Buildings in which <a href="https://www.vanderbilt.edu/coronavirus/faqs/interior-and-exterior-covid-signage/">signage and visual markers</a> have been installed will also be noted in the list below with this symbol <i class="fa fa-location-arrow" aria-hidden="true">&nbsp;</i>.</p>
<p>Please contact your building manager or facility officer with any questions or feedback on these plans.</p>

<div class="panel-body">
<p>Maintaining space between you and others is a best practice according to the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/social-distancing.html">CDC</a> and is required on the Vanderbilt campus to avoid exposure to the COVID-19 virus and slow its spread. Because people can spread the virus before they know they are sick, it is important to stay away from others whenever possible, even if you have no symptoms. Physical distancing and face mask/covering wearing is especially important for people who are at higher risk.</p>
<h4>Everyone on campus should follow these physical distancing practices:</h4>
<p><a href="https://www.vanderbilt.edu/coronavirus/faqs/safety-guidance-physical-distancing/">Physical distancing practices</a> and <a href="https://www.vanderbilt.edu/coronavirus/faqs/face-masks/">face mask/covering wearing</a> should be followed in all outdoor spaces.</p>
<p>In the interest of creating a culture where health and safety are promoted and realized, face masks/coverings must be worn by all individuals on campus in public settings (e.g., common workspaces, hallways, stairwells, elevators, meeting rooms, classrooms, break-rooms, campus outdoor spaces, restrooms, etc.). Appropriate use of face masks/coverings is important in minimizing risk to the wearer and those around them. A face mask/covering is not a substitute for physical distancing.</p>
<h4>Goals for outdoor spaces on campus include:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Creating an environment that maximizes safety and legibility while moving through campus</li>
<li>Making it possible on major routes to maintain a 6-foot distance while moving through campus</li>
<li>Using minimally invasive, maximally effective techniques</li>
<li>Designing all indoor and outdoor circulation plans with accessibility and mobility needs in mind</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://www.vanderbilt.edu/coronavirus/faqs/interior-and-exterior-covid-signage/">Wayfinding</a> will be phased in aligned with the Vanderbilt Return to Campus phases. This allows for the university to observe and adjust. The university is aiming to give people room and give people time to react.</p>
<p>The “Gold Path” network is a planning concept Vanderbilt is using to focus its wayfinding and signage efforts and coordinate with similar efforts within buildings. Paths designated as part of the “Gold Path” represent commonly used pedestrian paths. As the community continues to return to campus, the university will place its signage and monitoring efforts on these corridors.</p>
<p>Signage has been prepared aligned with <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/office-buildings.html">CDC</a> and <a href="https://acha-test.app.box.com/s/k202537ahi3w27b0w6cdhqxynr3vljif">ACHA</a> guidance and will be placed along the “Gold Path” network. Be mindful to follow the <a href="https://www.vanderbilt.edu/coronavirus/faqs/interior-and-exterior-covid-signage/">directional signage</a> and be prepared to change your daily routine to adhere to the new circulation patterns.</p>
<p>The following map shows the “Gold Path” network for the current university Phase 2.  Parking locations are noted with non-colored circles and popular destinations with colored circles. Major circulation routes are noted in gold.</p>

<h4>MEETINGS</h4>
<p>Based on <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/colleges-universities/considerations.html">CDC college and university</a> and <a href="https://acha-test.app.box.com/s/k202537ahi3w27b0w6cdhqxynr3vljif">ACHA</a> guidance, convening in groups carries a high risk of viral transmission. Gathering sizes are governed by university restrictions determined at each phase. Where feasible, meetings should be held in whole or in part using online collaboration tools (e.g., Zoom). When allowed, in-person meetings are limited to the restrictions of gathering sizes, assuming individuals can still maintain 6 feet of separation for physical distancing requirements. Departments should remove or rearrange chairs and tables (e.g., consider staggering seats) or add visual cue marks in meeting rooms to support physical distancing practices between attendees. During your time on site, you are encouraged to communicate with your colleagues and supervisors as needed by email, Skype messenger, telephone or other technology. You can also use a range of available collaboration tools (e.g., Zoom).</p>
<h4>GATHERINGS</h4>
<p>Vanderbilt is currently in phase 2 of its ramp-up, and gatherings up to 10 people are allowed as long as <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/prevention.html">CDC</a>-recommended physical distancing can be maintained, and safety protocols (e.g., face masks/coverings) are followed. Changes to gathering size restrictions will be communicated as the university continues to ramp up operations and prior to the start of the fall semester. Changes will be evaluated based on state, city and health guidance.</p>
<p>A definition of gatherings will be available by July 1.</p>

</ul>
<p><strong>Faculty, staff, or postdocs who have any symptoms must present to a VUMC COVID-19 assessment site.</strong></p>
<p><strong>For those who work in a higher-risk environment for infection with COVID-19 (e.g., some research facilities, VUPS, dining, child care, etc.), your department may require temperature  and symptom screening upon arrival to work.</strong> Your supervisor will advise you on this requirement prior to your return to campus and on where to report when you arrive for screening. Temperature screening on campus allows the university to know immediately if someone is symptomatic so that they can be directed to the VUMC COVID Hotline at 888-312-0847 for coordination of testing. As with all other absences, the faculty/staff/postdoc is responsible for informing their supervisor/mentor/dean. All persons conducting temperature screening will be trained in advance and will be required to wear personal protective equipment as appropriate.</p>
<p>In order to ensure compliance with privacy laws, records of temperature screenings or symptom assessments should not be maintained by departments. Departments may note that a staff member was not able to work on a given day(s) because they could not be cleared to work. <strong>Anyone with symptoms must self-isolate until testing results are back.</strong> If the results are negative, the person may return to campus without any formal clearance.</p>
<p>Any questions regarding the assessment process can be directed to Occupational Health (615-936-0955).</p>

<h4>UNDERGRADUATE STUDENT FUTURE</h4>
<p>Vanderbilt University is establishing its COVID-19 safety model by leveraging collaboration and partnership with the world-class Vanderbilt University Medical Center and Vanderbilt University School of Nursing to support and protect the Vanderbilt University community as much as possible.</p>
<p>As a core component of our preventive measures, we will have requirements for <strong>COVID-19 testing, as well as rigorous contact tracing and symptom management that are in alignment with recommendations from the </strong><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/shared-congregate-house/index.html">CDC</a><strong> and the </strong><a href="https://acha-test.app.box.com/s/k202537ahi3w27b0w6cdhqxynr3vljif">ACHA</a><strong>.</strong> We are partnering closely with the experts at VUMC and our School of Nursing to deploy their best practices in these areas.</p>
<h3>PRIOR TO CAMPUS ARRIVAL</h3>
<p>To identify asymptomatic, currently infected students before they arrive on campus, all undergraduate students will be required to complete pre-arrival testing within 14 days before coming to campus for the first time. Students can obtain the COVID-19 PCR test wherever they wish (local medical provider, local public health department, local mass testing station, etc.).</p>
<p>If a student cannot obtain a COVID-19 PCR test, direct guidance and support will be provided by Vanderbilt University, the Student Health Center and the Student Care Network.</p>
<p>If a student tests positive, that student should remain in self-isolation at home. If student tested positive for COVID-19 and had symptoms, clearance to come to campus is assigned when: 1) the individual remains fever-free without the use of fever reducers for 72 hours, 2) symptoms have improved, and 3) it has been at least 10 days since their symptoms first appeared. If student tested positive for COVID-19 but had no symptoms, the individual can be cleared to return 10 days after the test as long as the individual does not develop symptoms. If the individual develops symptoms, then the individual must follow the recovery strategy for those with symptoms.</p>
<p><strong>Details on pre-arrival testing (where and when to submit, types of tests, etc.) will be shared by July 15.</strong></p>
<h3>UPON ARRIVAL</h3>
<p>Members of the School of Nursing Nurse Faculty Practice Division, in conjunction with Student Health and VUMC, will perform symptom screens and nasal swab tests for all arriving undergraduate students. More details to be provided by July 15.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Vanderbilt is employing the best practice, gold standard polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing method as recommended by VUMC experts and will continue to evaluate all testing options and methods moving forward recognizing options are continually evolving. </span></p>
<h3>WHILE ON CAMPUS</h3>
<p>Students who have symptoms related to COVID-19 should contact Student Health (615-322-2427). Individuals who need emergency care should contact 911 for ambulance transport to the nearest Emergency Department. Students who determine they need to be tested based on potential exposure but do not have any symptoms will receive testing.</p>
<p>VU will set up a testing center in partnership with VUMC and the School of Nursing that will offer testing to asymptomatic individuals who meet testing criteria developed in partnership with VUMC infectious disease experts.  These capabilities will be in place before students return to campus.  The criteria for asymptomatic testing will be reviewed and revised as conditions on campus and in the community change.</p>
<p><strong>More details regarding that testing will be provided by July 15.</strong></p>
<h3>TESTING DETAILS</h3>
<p><span class="s1">Vanderbilt is currently evaluating manufacturers for best-in-class options for large-scale asymptomatic testing and will be partnering with VUMC for testing of any student exhibiting symptoms of COVID-19.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Vanderbilt is currently evaluating testing labs for best-in-class turnaround time for large-scale asymptomatic testing and will be partnering with VUMC for testing of any student exhibiting symptoms of COVID-19 for the most rapid turnaround time possible.

<p>Our plan for Vanderbilt-controlled housing for the 2020–2021 academic year is student focused. COVID-19 conditions mean we needed to identify quarantine and isolation locations for our undergraduate residential community and to de-densify residential spaces to provide housing that is as safe as possible. The CDC defines <strong>isolation</strong> as separating sick people with a contagious disease from people who are not sick and <strong>quarantine</strong> as separating and restricting the movement of people who were exposed to a contagious disease to see if they become sick.</p>
<p><strong>Blakemore House (an on-campus residence hall) and Scarritt Bennett Center (an off-campus property operated by the university and located in close proximity to campus) will be used for campus resident isolation and quarantine space.</strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">University health officials will make medical determinations and assign campus residents to either diagnostic quarantine or COVID-positive isolation to sites specifically designated for these purposes. </span><span class="s1">University health officials will make medical evaluations and release campus residents from quarantine or isolation to return to their campus residence hall room when deemed medically appropriate.</span></p>
<p>For students living off campus, we cannot offer isolation space on campus due to resource constraints. Public health guidance suggests that we treat students residing together off campus like a family unit; students should isolate in their off campus residence and handle isolation as family would. Furthermore, university health officials will make medical determinations and direct students to quarantine or isolate at their off-campus residences. When deemed appropriate after medical evaluations, university health officials will release students from quarantine or isolation in their off-campus residences.</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Student Health will work with all such students to do regular symptom monitoring and will hospitalize anyone who becomes seriously ill.</span></p>

<h4>COVID-19 TESTING</h4>
<p>Faculty, staff and postdocs who have symptoms related to COVID-19 or determine that they need to be tested based on potential exposure are encouraged to call Occupational Health at 615-936-0955. Individuals who need emergency care should contact 911 for ambulance transport to the nearest Emergency Department.</p>
<p>Individuals who have symptoms or may have been exposed and are off campus may contact Occupational Health or may also contact their primary care provider for COVID-19 testing locations in their area.</p>
<p>If a faculty member, staff member, or postdoc believes they have contracted COVID-19 after exposure to a known COVID-positive person on campus and/or while performing job duties, health care professionals may direct the individual to complete a First Report of Work Injury or Illness. The individual who has been exposed must stop work immediately and leave campus, even if the individual is not showing symptoms. The individual is required to notify their supervisor that they are leaving and notify Occupational Health that they have been exposed and/or developed symptoms. An individual awaiting test results must remain at home in self-isolation and keep their supervisor/mentor/dean informed of their return-to-campus status.</p>
<p>At the current time, asymptomatic testing is not routinely recommended by either <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/shared-congregate-house/index.html">CDC</a>and the<a href="https://acha-test.app.box.com/s/k202537ahi3w27b0w6cdhqxynr3vljif">ACHA</a> for faculty, staff, or post-docs who live in apartment-style housing or single-family homes instead of residence halls.  The Metro Nashville Public Health Department is offering free asymptomatic testing to anyone who wants it at their testing sites available at <a href="https://www.asafenashville.org/">asafenashville.org</a>.</p>
<p>Insurance provider Aetna is taking significant steps in response to COVID-19. Effective immediately, Aetna will waive co-pays and member cost share for all diagnostic testing related to COVID-19. This will cover the test kit for patients who meet CDC guidelines for testing, which can be performed in any approved laboratory location.</p>

<h4>Positive Case and Contact Tracing</h4>
<p>Faculty, staff, postdocs who test positive for COVID-19 must self-isolate at home and follow current CDC guidance. To help determine the risk of potential exposure to co-workers and others on campus, Occupational Health will conduct contact tracing with the individual who has tested positive. Exposed individuals will be given the name of the individual who tested positive so that their risk can be assessed. Occupational Health may contact the supervisor if further contact tracing of the COVID-19 positive individual is needed; however, the actual test result (and any other protected health information) will not be disclosed.</p>
<p>Individuals who have been exposed to a COVID-19 positive person are entered into Occupational Health’s symptom monitoring survey that is completed daily. The objective is to inform individuals of known exposures and to closely monitor each individual to ensure that any signs of infection are addressed early.</p>
<p>Vanderbilt is following CDC’s recommended recovery strategy. If an individual had symptoms, recovery status (and clearance to return to campus/work) is assigned when: 1) the individual remains fever-free without the use of fever reducers for 72 hours, 2) symptoms have improved, and 3) it has been at least 10 days since their symptoms first appeared. If the individual tested positive for COVID-19 but had no symptoms, the individual can be cleared to return 10 days after the test as long as the individual does not develop symptoms. If the individual develops symptoms, then the individual must follow the recovery strategy for those with symptoms. Notification for return to on-campus activities is directed through Occupational Health.</p>

If physical distancing is possible, individuals working in private offices or laboratory environments that do not otherwise require face masks/coverings may remove their face masks/coverings while in such spaces. Appropriate use of face masks/coverings is important in minimizing risks to the wearers and those around them according to both <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/diy-cloth-face-coverings.html">CDC</a> and <a href="https://acha-test.app.box.com/s/k202537ahi3w27b0w6cdhqxynr3vljif">ACHA</a> guidance. You could spread COVID-19 to others even if you do not feel sick. The face mask/covering is not a substitute for physical distancing. This applies to off-site and leased building space, as well as on the main Vanderbilt campus, both indoors and outdoors.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.2rem">Each faculty member, staff member, postdoc and student will be provided with one cloth face covering. Disposable masks will be provided, if needed. Individuals and departments can contact their assigned building manager or liaison in their college, school or department to acquire cloth face coverings or disposable masks. You also may wear homemade cloth face coverings that adhere to CDC and other public health recommendations. This will help Vanderbilt reduce the need to purchase additional masks, which are in short supply. A disposable mask must not be used for more than one day. See details regarding face mask/covering use and care below.</span></p>
<p>An individual who is having difficulty wearing a face mask/covering should contact <a href="https://www.vumc.org/health-wellness/occupational-health/">Occupational Health</a> (faculty, staff, postdoc) or <a href="https://www.vumc.org/student-health/">Student Health</a> (student) for direction. A faculty member, staff member, or postdoc who cannot wear a face mask/covering because of medical or other reasons should contact the <a href="https://www.vanderbilt.edu/eeo/">Equal Employment Opportunity office</a> for possible accommodation measures.  Students should contact <a href="https://www.vanderbilt.edu/student-access/">Student Access Services</a> for possible accommodation measures.</p>

<p>The university is using a streamlined process to evaluate an individual’s concerns about how their personal circumstances surrounding COVID-19 may place them at greater risk. That risk may be the result of their own underlying health condition or age, or it may be due to the health condition of a family member for whom the individual provides care. Vanderbilt is taking every appropriate precaution to protect our entire community as we return to campus and classrooms.</p>
<p>Individuals with certain conditions may have a higher risk for COVID-19 infection. According to the CDC, people at increased risk include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Age 65 years and older</li>

<p>Supporting our students is our utmost priority, and the university is committed to providing options and alternatives that allow all of our students access to a world-renowned education, no matter the instruction mode.</p>
<p>All courses will be prepared to be offered both in person and remotely. This gives us flexibility to adapt to remote instruction only should conditions warrant it.</p>
<p>Vanderbilt University may choose to transition to remote-only learning based on the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Local, state or national shelter-in-place advisories or restrictions that require remote-only learning</li>
<li>Quarantine and self-isolation capacity for the residential population</li>
<li>A surge in cases coupled with increased severity of illness among campus demographic cohorts</li>
<li>Contact tracing analysis (a surge in cases tied to an event vs. tied to rampant community spread with severe illness may be treated differently, for example)</li>
</ul>
<p><em><strong>(6/25/2020 update)</strong></em> In the event that Vanderbilt has to make the switch to fully remote instruction, we will likely need to more drastically de-densify campus. Residence halls may have to close; special arrangements may be made for international students who cannot travel and for other students with special circumstances.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The decision to begin the semester enrolled in on-campus instruction will be accompanied by acknowledgment of responsibility for full payment of tuition, housing costs and relevant fees. <strong>No refunds will be issued if the need arises to finish the semester remotely.</strong></span></p>

<p>Plant Operations, a unit within the Vanderbilt University Facilities Department, will operate in accordance with the increased cleaning and <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/disinfecting-building-facility.html">disinfection protocols</a> recommended by the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/clean-disinfect/index.html">Centers for Disease Control</a>, using <a href="https://www.epa.gov/pesticide-registration/list-n-disinfectants-use-against-sars-cov-2-covid-19">Environmental Protection Agency-</a>approved products that are effective against the COVID-19 virus. Throughout the pandemic, Plant Operations has monitored and adopted CDC recommendations.</p>
<p>The CDC’s “<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/colleges-universities/considerations.html">Considerations for Institutes of Higher Education</a>,” May 30 updated guidance specifically recommends routine disinfecting and cleaning of surfaces and objects that are frequently touched using the cleaners typically used, according to the directions on the label. The CDC says that most common EPA-registered <a href="https://www.epa.gov/pesticide-registration/list-n-disinfectants-use-against-sars-cov-2-covid-19">household disinfectants</a> should be effective.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">At a minimum, there will be twice daily disinfecting of high-touch areas throughout campus. Classrooms will be disinfected daily during routine cleaning. Disinfecting wipes will be provided in classrooms and other spaces for use by the occupants. Facilities is also implementing zone-based disinfectant teams who will be easily identifiable.</span></p>
<p>Facilities will follow <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/disinfecting-building-facility.html">CDC guidelines</a> <span style="font-size: 1.2rem">for cleaning of outdoor areas, which calls for routine cleaning.</span></p>
<p>Plant Operations staff received cleaning and disinfection protocols training at the onset of the pandemic and will attend future training sessions on the latest protocols. In accordance with CDC and university guidelines, all staff members will wear the required personal protective equipment including face masks/coverings while on campus.</p>
<p>In addition to normal cleaning routines, custodial staff will also disinfect frequently touched surfaces or high-touch points and objects using EPA approved products. Examples of frequently touched surfaces and objects that will receive the minimal twice-daily disinfection are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tables in common spaces</li>
<li>Doorknobs</li>
<li>Light switches</li>
<li>Door handles</li>
<li>Hand railings</li>
<li>Bathroom stalls</li>
<li>Sink handles</li>
<li>Grab bars</li>
<li>Water fountains</li>
</ul>
<p>Cleaning services for public/common spaces such as restrooms, lounges, lobbies, and hallways will be increased. Other duties such as emptying trash, vacuuming/cleaning of floors of private offices once per week will continue. Otherwise, cleaning/disinfecting of private offices and work areas will be the responsibility of occupants.</p>
<p>The following will NOT be cleaned by custodial staff.</p>
<ul>
<li>Desks</li>
<li>Keyboards</li>
<li>Touch screens</li>
<li>Remote controls</li>
</ul>
<p>Disposable wipes will be made available through each school/college’s and department’s building or facilities officer so that commonly used surfaces and objects can be wiped down before use. For soft surfaces such as carpeted floors or fabric in seating areas, guidance indicates to continue cleaning with cleaners appropriate for use on these surfaces and disinfecting with appropriate product for the specific surfaces; vacuum carpets as usual.</p>
<h3>Hand Sanitizing Products and Touchless Features</h3>
<ul>
<li>Hand sanitizing stations will be located at key areas within all campus buildings.</li>
<li>Sanitizing products such as hand pumps and wipes will be available at key locations (ingress/egress, elevator lobbies, etc.) and can be obtained through each school/college’s and department’s building or facilities officer.</li>
<li>Foot pulls will be installed on doors of high-use areas such as restrooms.</li>
<li>Plant Operations will gradually replace hand-operated paper towels and soap dispensers with touchless products in restrooms.</li>
</ul>
<p>These practices will continue to evolve as the CDC releases new recommendations.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.epa.gov/coronavirus/frequent-questions-about-indoor-air-and-coronavirus-covid-19">guidance</a> from these sources is very similar and falls into three basic categories:</p>
<ul>
<li>Increasing the amount of outside air being delivered to spaces</li>
<li>Using high-efficiency filtration in systems that circulate air around large numbers of spaces</li>
<li>Maintaining temperature and humidity levels within spaces</li>
</ul>
<p>The university is implementing strategies to comply with these guidelines. The Facilities Department is also working to implement an overnight cycle during which buildings are flushed with an increased volume of outside air without exceeding the heating and cooling system capacities.</p>
<p>The Facilities Department will continue to adhere to <a href="https://www.ashrae.org/technical-resources/filtration-disinfection#mechanical">ASHRAE published guidance</a> for safe and healthy buildings, which emphasizes increased fresh-air ventilation and close management of indoor air quality, temperature and humidity.</p>
<p>To keep the Vanderbilt community as healthy as possible, indoor conditions will be maintained at temperatures ranging from 68 to 76 degrees and relative humidity of 45 to 50 percent.</p>
<p>Although the university is implementing these extra safety measures, it is up to each member of the Vanderbilt community to practice <a href="https://www.vanderbilt.edu/coronavirus/faqs/safety-guidance-physical-distancing/">physical distancing</a>, <a href="https://www.vanderbilt.edu/coronavirus/faqs/handwashing/">washing or sanitizing hands</a>, and using <a href="https://www.vanderbilt.edu/coronavirus/faqs/face-masks/">face masks/coverings</a> in all public spaces on campus to limit the spread of COVID-19, as recommended by the CDC.</p>

It may not be possible for the university to provide product for personal use, but before you leave any room in which you have been working or eating, it is <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/colleges-universities/considerations.html">recommended</a> that you swab down all work or eating areas with EPA-registered disinfectant. This includes a private workspace or any shared-space location or equipment (e.g., computers, A/V and other electrical equipment, copiers, desks and tables, chair arms, light switches, doorknobs, handles, etc.). To the best of your ability, you should clear desk and table surfaces in personal offices and workstations to aid in thorough cleaning. Using a hand sanitizer that contains at least 60 percent alcohol is also effective after contacting commonly used surfaces.</p>

Physical distancing is especially important for people who are at higher risk. Individuals on campus should follow these physical distancing practices:</p>
<ul>
<li>Stay at least 6 feet (about 2 arms’ length) from other people.</li>
<li>Do not gather in groups.</li>
<li>Stay out of crowded places and avoid mass gatherings.</li>

<p>In an effort to guide the university community in practicing healthy behaviors during the COVID-19 pandemic, Vanderbilt has launched the Public Health Ambassa&#8217;Dores program to address questions regarding campus health and safety measures.</p>
<p>The program has been established as an additional resource for the Vanderbilt community to navigate changes on campus. As identified representatives of the university, the Public Health Ambassa&#8217;Dores will help promote social norms to create a safe working and learning environment for all within the Vanderbilt University community. Ambassa&#8217;Dores will model exemplary adherence to all university protocols, serve as peer models and sources of information for individuals on campus, assist with knowledge dissemination and help communicate across specific sub-communities, and more.</p>
<p>The first ambassadors selected for the program are VUPS community service officers, and the program will expand prior to the fall semester to include other individuals (e.g., facility/building managers, volunteers among staff, faculty, students). The Public Health Ambassa&#8217;Dores will receive training, resources and support to prepare them for the role.</p>

<div class="panel-body">
<p>Vanderbilt’s Return to Campus Plan follows a phased and data-driven approach and considers the city of Nashville’s phases, adapting them to be applicable to a college campus.</p>
<p>Compliance serves as an important aspect of the Return to Campus Plan, reminding campus community members of their responsibilities in helping to reduce the spread of COVID-19. With the understanding that campus life will look very different with compliance in place, guidelines have been developed to promote the health and safety of the campus community as much as possible.</p>
<h4>ADDRESSING NONCOMPLIANCE</h4>
<p>Students, faculty, staff and postdocs will be expected to comply with all university policies and protocols designed to reduce the spread of COVID-19 infection and promote the health and safety of the Vanderbilt and Nashville communities.</p>
<p>Intentional or reckless disregard for these policies and protocols by students will be addressed through the Office of Student Accountability, Community Standards, and Academic Integrity, using the existing sanctioning considerations found in the <em>Student Handbook,</em> including by reviewing the potential impact on the community in the evaluation of the nature and severity of the incident, which may support an enhanced sanction.</p>
<p>The Vanderbilt <em>Faculty Manual</em> provides that faculty may be disciplined for violations of the university’s standards of conduct. The process for reaching a decision to discipline a faculty member is overseen by the dean in consultation with the provost.</p>
<p>The university’s progressive discipline policy states that a staff member can be disciplined for violations of protocols and procedures governing safety. The policy outlines a process for correcting single and repeat episodes of employee failure to comply with rules. Safety violations will be handled under this process.</p>

<p>Given our continued restrictions on large gatherings and the health and safety protocols that we will have in place concerning physical distancing, we have made the difficult decision to <strong>cancel Family Weekend this year</strong>, which had been tentatively scheduled for Oct. 9-10. We will officially communicate this decision to all parents and families in the coming days. This is traditionally one of our favorite weekends of the year and we deeply regret having to cancel it, but we believe it is a necessary step as part of our efforts to protect the health and safety of all members of the Vanderbilt community as much as possible.</p>

<h3>Vanderbilt University’s policies and protocols for responding to the COVID-19 pandemic are rooted in safety for staff, faculty, students, invited guests (e.g., contractors), and the public with whom we interact.

<p>As we confront this health crisis, Vanderbilt University will remain steadfast in the constant pursuit of our mission and ideals outlined in the Academic Strategic Plan. Therefore, the university will ramp up in phases with primary mission activities at the heart of all decision making. Mission-centric activities are any required on-campus activities that fulfill Vanderbilt’s core mission of teaching and research.</p>
<p>Radically different ways of deploying VU campus resources, including physical spaces, will be necessary as part of establishing a new normal. As we move forward, flexibility will be critical. Vanderbilt University’s return to learning and discovering on campus will occur in phases of increased activity and will involve the careful evaluation of data, models and public health recommendations. Protocols will be pragmatic and will evolve over time.</p>
<p>Vanderbilt University’s plans for expanding operations and increasing the presence of faculty, staff and students will be guided by the following criteria:</p>
<ul>
<li>The intentional effort by all faculty, staff and students to exercise both personal and community responsibility. The combined efforts by all members of the Vanderbilt community will create a culture that sustains a healthy and safe on-campus environment.</li>
<li>Existing and projected government restrictions (e.g., safer-at-home orders, masking requirements, physical distancing, gatherings, etc.).</li>
<li>Public health status: recommendations from the federal government (recently released Opening Guidelines), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and Vanderbilt University Medical Center.</li>
<li>Resource availability, including personal protective equipment for students, faculty and staff.</li>
<li>Contact tracing and case management protocols.</li>
<li>Physical distancing strategies.</li>
<li>Financial feasibility.</li>
<li>Alignment with Vanderbilt’s strategic framework that the ramp-up of on-campus activities will support primary mission objectives of the institution (on-campus research, on-campus teaching and instruction, on-campus residential living and learning).</li>
</ul>
<p>Vanderbilt University’s plans will also take into account local orders and ordinances of the City of Nashville, Davidson County and the Nashville Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA), as well as the State of Tennessee’s “Tennessee Pledge: Reopening Tennessee Responsibly.”</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.asafenashville.org/roadmap-for-reopening-nashville/">Roadmap for Reopening Nashville</a> follows a four-phase approach. The Vanderbilt University Return to Campus Plan acknowledges the triggers and phases of ramp-up for the city in which Vanderbilt is located and identifies which activities ramp up on campus and when. The Vanderbilt University activities that will ramp up are identified below in each corresponding phase. <strong>Vanderbilt’s ramp-up may lag the Nashville ramp-up and will be tailored to our own unique density, operations, and other considerations as a residential education institution.</strong> The university will communicate with the VU community in advance of each phase. If metrics of COVID-19 transmission and health system capacity change significantly, and Metro Nashville returns to a prior phase, Vanderbilt may also return to a prior phase and re-impose restrictions on activities.</p>

<p>Vanderbilt will phase in a return of faculty, staff and postdocs in a coordinated process to ensure appropriate physical distancing, availability of protective gear and testing capabilities for COVID-19. Individuals will return to campus based on the core activities they support and their demonstrated need to be on campus. No one should return to campus without authorization.</p>
<p>These efforts will be tightly coordinated to mitigate potential risks and ensure the safety of our campus community and the other communities we serve. No unit or department should increase authorized levels beyond current needs to support critical on-site operations and activities without approval from the appropriate dean or vice chancellor. Once decisions to expand on-site levels of return in certain areas are made, individuals should follow the campuswide policies and protocols detailed in this guide for returning to work on campus.</p>
<p>Compliance with the policies and protocols outlined on this website, as well as those from your supervisor/mentor/dean, is required for continued access; violation (e.g., blatant disregard for infection prevention measures) may result in the immediate revocation of building access privileges, disciplinary action, and/or other interventions.</p>

<p>Staff will be recalled to campus in an orderly fashion in support of core mission activities (on-campus research; on-campus instruction; undergraduate residential living and learning). Staff will be informed by their supervisors when and under what circumstances they are to return to work on campus and should not return until authorized.</p>
<h4>REMOTE WORK</h4>
<p>Those who can work remotely to fulfill their work responsibilities should continue to do so to limit the number of individuals on campus and the spread of the COVID-19 virus. <strong>Remote work arrangements must be approved by the immediate supervisor</strong> and can be accomplished on a full or partial day/week schedule as appropriate.</p>
<h4>ALTERNATING DAYS OR ALTERNATING WEEKS</h4>
<p>Based on <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/office-buildings.html">CDC employer</a> and <a href="https://acha-test.app.box.com/s/k202537ahi3w27b0w6cdhqxynr3vljif">ACHA</a> guidance, to limit the number of individuals and interactions on campus, departments should consider scheduling partial staffing on alternating days or weeks with staff who are required on campus (e.g., two weeks remote, two weeks on campus OR one week on campus, three weeks remote). Such scheduling will enable physical distancing, especially in areas with large common workspaces. To contain “germ circles,” it is best to schedule the same people on the same days to limit any one individual’s exposure to other individuals when possible.</p>
<h4>STAGGERED REPORTING/DEPARTING</h4>
<p>Based on <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/office-buildings.html">CDC employer</a> and <a href="https://acha-test.app.box.com/s/k202537ahi3w27b0w6cdhqxynr3vljif">ACHA</a> guidance, the beginning and end of the workday typically bring many people together at common entry/exit points of buildings. Staggering reporting and departure times by at least 15 minutes will reduce traffic in common areas to meet physical distancing requirements. (See <a href="https://www.vanderbilt.edu/coronavirus/faqs/entry-exit-control/">Indoor and Outdoor Spaces: Entry/exit controls</a> for further details.)</p>

<h4>Study Abroad</h4>
<p>Vanderbilt has suspended participation in all Global Education Office study abroad programs for fall 2020. Many factors make study abroad challenging at this time, including the continued restrictions on entry to all countries in which GEO offers programming, travel restrictions within and among countries, lack of visa processing, and the difficulty of predicting specifics of the health and safety situation for our students. Given the pandemic and ongoing need for measures including quarantines and physical distancing, we are also mindful that study abroad experiences in the coming months likely would not look like the study abroad you’ve imagined.</p>
<h4>Personal Travel</h4>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We ask that students stay in the Nashville area and not travel away from campus for weekend trips through the end of in-person classes on Friday, November 20. </span></p>
<p>In addition, there will not be any University-sponsored travel during the fall semester, including for registered student organizations.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Undergraduate residential students who are able to do so <b>will leave campus for the Thanksgiving holiday and will not return to campus until the start of the spring semester.</b> We are adopting this plan based on current public health guidance regarding risks associated with coming and going to and from campus, and models suggesting a potential resurgence of COVID-19 cases with the onset of influenza season.</span></p>
