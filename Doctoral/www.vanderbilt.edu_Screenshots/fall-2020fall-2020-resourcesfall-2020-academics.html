All undergraduate students will complete the final week of classes and then take final exams remotely through virtual and alternative platforms, with the semester concluding on Sunday, December 13.</p>
<p>There will be no fall break this year. In addition, we ask that students stay in the Nashville area and not travel away from campus for weekend trips through the end of in-person classes on Friday, November 20. <a href="https://www.vanderbilt.edu/coronavirus/travel-information/">Read more on travel here.</a></p>
<p>Undergraduate residential students who are able to do so will leave campus for the Thanksgiving holiday and will not return to campus until the start of the spring semester. We are adopting this plan based on current public health guidance regarding risks associated with coming and going to and from campus, and models suggesting a potential resurgence of COVID-19 cases with the onset of influenza season.</p>

<h3><span>WORK-STUDY POSITIONS </span></h3>
<p>We have received questions about if having class schedules confirmed later will conflict with when students can apply for work-study positions. Work schedules for most students are flexible, dependent upon the needs of the department. It is not uncommon for students to switch classes, and most departments are flexible with students to accommodate class schedule changes.</p>

When you receive the reading in July, you will also receive instructions on how to complete the essay. This year, the deadline by which you will need to do both has been extended to accommodate for present circumstances.</span><span> </span></p>

<li>Tuition will remain the same for both remote and on-campus course work. There will be no discounted tuition rate provided for students who cannot be on campus regardless of the reason.</li>
<li>The Student Services Fee is a mandatory fee and may not be waived via student petition.</li>
<li>If a student withdraws during the term, tuition will be adjusted/prorated based on the approved Student Account Withdrawal Schedules located on the Student Accounts website:
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.vanderbilt.edu/stuaccts/undergraduate/withdrawal-schedule.php">Undergraduate students</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.vanderbilt.edu/stuaccts/graduate/withdrawal-schedule.php">Graduate and professional students</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>We will begin processing undergraduate financial aid on Tuesday, September 8, 2020.</li>
<li>Vanderbilt currently partners with AWG Dewar to offer a tuition insurance program for students who experience a serious illness or accident and have to leave school for medical reasons before the semester is completed. <a href="https://www.vanderbilt.edu/stuaccts/undergraduate/tuition-insurance.php">View detailed information for the tuition insurance plan.</a></li>
<li>The decision to begin the semester enrolled in on-campus instruction will be accompanied by acknowledgment of responsibility for full payment of tuition, housing costs and relevant fees. <strong>No refunds <span class="s2" style="font-size: 1.2rem">for these costs </span><span class="s1" style="font-size: 1.2rem">will be issued if the need to finish the semester remotely arises</span><span class="s2" style="font-size: 1.2rem">; adjustments for unused portions of meal plans will be available in that situation</span><span class="s1" style="font-size: 1.2rem">.</span></strong></li>
</ul>
<h4>COST OF ATTENDANCE</h4>
<p><span class="TextRun SCXW10966969 BCX0" lang="EN" xml:lang="EN"><span class="NormalTextRun SCXW10966969 BCX0">Our estimated cost of attendance for on-campus, off-campus and with parents is available </span></span><a class="Hyperlink SCXW10966969 BCX0" href="https://www.vanderbilt.edu/financialaid/costs.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><span class="TextRun Underlined SCXW10966969 BCX0" lang="EN" xml:lang="EN"><span class="NormalTextRun SCXW10966969 BCX0">here</span></span></a><span class="TextRun SCXW10966969 BCX0" lang="EN" xml:lang="EN"><span class="NormalTextRun SCXW10966969 BCX0">.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="TextRun SCXW200077063 BCX0" lang="EN" xml:lang="EN"><span class="NormalTextRun SCXW200077063 BCX0">We expect normal increases in the cost of attendance each year. If you are studying remotely, which has a lower cost of attendance, this will be increased if you move on-campus or are living off-campus (not with parents).</span></span></p>
<h3>OFF-CAMPUS STUDENTS</h3>
<p><span class="TextRun SCXW40709805 BCX0" lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US"><span class="NormalTextRun SCXW40709805 BCX0">The cost of living on campus is part of the </span></span><a class="Hyperlink SCXW40709805 BCX0" href="https://www.vanderbilt.edu/financialaid/costs.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><span class="TextRun Underlined SCXW40709805 BCX0" lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US"><span class="NormalTextRun SCXW40709805 BCX0">normal cost of attendance</span></span></a><span class="TextRun SCXW40709805 BCX0" lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US"><span class="NormalTextRun SCXW40709805 BCX0"> used in determining eligibility for financial aid. That amount does not change for students who are living off-campus (not with parents). Students who are living off-campus will need to complete a form attesting that you are not living with parent(s). Falsifying the form will be considered a student conduct issue that could lead to suspension or expulsion.</span></span><span class="EOP SCXW40709805 BCX0"> </span></p>
<h3>REMOTE STUDENTS</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.vanderbilt.edu/financialaid/costs-remote.php">The cost of attendance for those students studying remotely</a> is less than for those studying on-campus, reflecting lower housing and meal costs than those incurred for living on campus. However, your eligibility for need-based assistance is based upon the following formula: Cost of Attendance minus Expected Family Contribution = Demonstrated Need</p>
<p>What your family is expected to pay does not change based upon which method of learning you will choose.</p>

So far, the library has been able to provide e-texts or scans for 83.2 percent of all requests. The university has invested resources to increase accessibility, and library staff have scanned thousands of items, so that many items that were unavailable previously are now available digitally.</p>
<p>Vanderbilt Libraries will follow university guidelines and current CDC public health recommendations in order to create the safest space possible for library staff and patrons.</p>
<p><strong>Gradual reopening of in-person library services</strong></p>
<p>Phase 1: A small group of library staff returned to the Central Library, and pick-up started on June 1, limited to the Central and Divinity libraries.</p>
<p>Phase 2: We will be expanding the number of pick-up and drop-off locations for faculty who are unable to access materials digitally. We will increase staff in order to 1) get items processed for the end of the fiscal year; 2) check in and shelve items returned to the various departmental libraries; 3) prepare for special collections users in Phase 3; 4) begin to scan and digitize more items; 5) work on reserves requests; and 6) generally get ready for the fall semester. We will also start preparing for user access which will start in Phase 3.</p>
<p>Phase 3: We will allow access to researchers. Also, the library directors are currently working to ensure that each library building has an approved circulation pattern and that user areas are set up to ensure social distancing protocols are followed. We are also working to reconfigure space in the libraries to use as additional classroom and instructional space.</p>
<p>The libraries homepage will continue to offer the latest updates to library hours, resources and services.</p>
