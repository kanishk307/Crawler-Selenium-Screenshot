<p><em>The Corpus Christi Caller-Times</em>, April 28, 2020 <br/> &#8220;The world literally is awash in oil, but this will get better. This too shall pass.&#8221; <br/> <strong>&#8212; Thomas Tunstall, senior director of research at UTSA&#8217;S Institute for Economic Development</strong></p>
<h4 class="mb-0"><a href="https://www.ksat.com/video/news/2020/04/27/coronavirus-saq-dr-mike-villarreal-director-of-utsa-urban-education-institute/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"> Coronavirus SAQ: Dr. Mike Villarreal, Director of UTSA Urban Education Institute </a></h4>
<p><em>KSAT-TV</em>, April 27, 2020 <br/> &#8220;I don&#8217;t think we will have a lost generation (from this interruption in the way they were learning), but this certainly impacts the learning trajectory of many students and will impact students in different ways.&#8221; <br/> <strong>&#8212; Mike Villarreal, Director of UTSA Urban Education Institute</strong></p>
<h4 class="mb-0"><a href="https://www.expressnews.com/business/article/Corona-SA-Reopens-15227809.php" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"> San Antonio, Bexar County leaders hustling to develop best phased-in reopening plan </a></h4>
<p><em>San Antonio Express-News</em>, April 27, 2020 <br/> &#8220;The complexity of the (PPP) program, and the magnitude of the problem, those were the things that were overwhelming. And simultaneously, we were getting feedback from the banking community that they were learning as we were going .&#8221; <br/> <strong>&#8212; Rod McSherry, an associate vice president who leads UTSA&#8217;s Small Business Development Center</strong></p>
<h4 class="mb-0"><a href="https://therivardreport.com/week-11-in-review-san-antonio-by-the-numbers/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"> Week 11 in Review: San Antonio by the Numbers </a></h4>
<p><em>The Rivard Report</em>, April 26, 2020 <br/> &#8220;Unemployment in San Antonio likely will reach 14%, nearly quadrupling the pre-COVID-19 unemployment rate, yet still lower than what is predicted for other Texas cities.&#8221; <br/> <strong>&#8212; Thomas Tunstall, senior director of research at UTSA&#8217;S Institute for Economic Development</strong></p>
<h4 class="mb-0"><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2020/04/26/how-past-crises-changed-americas-public-schools-so-too-will-covid-19/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"> How past crises changed America&#8217;s public schools &#8212; &#8216;and so too will covid-19&#8217; </a></h4>
<p><em>The Washington Post</em>, April 26, 2020 <br/> &#8220;Diseases have shuttered entire school systems, and educators have found creative means to continue the work of teaching and learning, via radio decades before, and now moving lessons on to Google Classroom. And just as past crises have reshaped our schools, so too will covid-19.&#8221; <br/> <strong>&#8212; Anne Marie Ryan, professor and department chair of interdisciplinary learning and teaching</strong></p>
<h4 class="mb-0"><a href="https://salud-america.org/19-ways-to-ensure-health-equity-for-latinos-during-and-after-coronavirus/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"> 19 Ways to Ensure Health Equity for Latinos During (and After) COVID-19 </a></h4>
<p><em>Salud America</em>, April 24, 2020 <br/> &#8220;As Latinos have been particularly instrumental as the engine of the U.S. economy, they will play a major role in building back that economy. However, as is the case with many other groups around the country, Latinos will need major assistance to recover from the maladies of the Coronavirus pandemic.&#8221; <br/> <strong>&#8212; Rogelio S&#225;enz, a professor of Demography</strong></p>

<p><em>KSAT-TV</em>, April 24, 2020 <br/> &#8220;I recognize the urgency and the need to restart the economy. We have to take care of our people. However, we have to do it in a way that will not create a problem for everybody in a few months or a few weeks if this pathogen continues to be progressing at the speed with which it has been progressing.&#8221; <br/> <strong>&#8212; Juan Gutierrez, chair of mathematics</strong></p>

<p><em>San Antonio Business Journal</em>, April 24, 2020 <br/> &#8220;Telehealth has already proved to be effective for so many families. While I have been working to research the telehealth applied behavior analysis over the past five years, the pandemic has accelerated this work.&#8221; <br/> <strong>&#8212; Leslie Neely, assistant professor of educational psychology</strong></p>
<h4 class="mb-0"><a href="https://www.expressnews.com/opinion/commentary/article/Commentary-Oil-industry-ripples-to-keep-Texas-15224082.php" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"> Commentary: Oil industry ripples to keep Texas off-kilter </a></h4>
<p><em>San Antonio Express-News</em>, April 24, 2020 <br/> &#8220;With regard to oil and gas markets, it&#8217;s simply a case of too many sellers and not enough buyers. Where crude oil prices go in the future is anyone&#8217;s guess, but the near-term trend does not offer much encouragement.&#8221; <br/> <strong>&#8212; Thomas Tunstall, senior director of research at UTSA&#8217;S Institute for Economic Development</strong></p>

<p><em>Elite Daily</em>, April 23, 2020 <br/> &#8220;Strictly examining the situation, from the time that you order the package, and it gets in transit and then it gets through your door, it is very unlikely that the virus stayed alive through that process, given the environmental conditions.&#8221; <br/> <strong>&#8212; Dr. Priyanka Mishra, a biology research scientist and professor</strong></p>
<h4 class="mb-0"><a href="https://www.ksat.com/news/local/2020/04/23/utsa-professor-behind-covid-19-model-says-early-response-prevented-explosion-in-cases-in-bexar-county/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"> UTSA professor behind COVID-19 model says early response &#8216;prevented explosion in cases&#8217; in Bexar County </a></h4>
<p><em>KSAT-TV</em>, April 23, 2020 <br/> &#8220;An early response prevented an explosion in the number of cases. Had the Mayor (Nirenberg) and County Judge (Wolff) not acted early, the crisis would have been significantly larger. The city lockdown has slowed down the progression of the disease. It allowed the health system to prepare for what is likely to be an inevitable surge.&#8221; <br/> <strong>&#8212; Juan Gutierrez, chair of mathematics</strong></p>
<h4 class="mb-0"><a href="https://www.expressnews.com/business/article/Bexar-County-has-4th-highest-unemployment-claims-15221360.php" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"> Bexar County has fourth-highest unemployment claims total in Texas </a></h4>
<p><em>San Antonio Express-News</em>, April 23, 2020 <br/> &#8220;San Antonio seems to be holding up pretty well compared to the nation. I&#8217;ve got to attribute that to the diversified nature of the (San Antonio) economy.&#8221; <br/> <strong>&#8212; Thomas Tunstall, senior director of research at UTSA&#8217;S Institute for Economic Development</strong></p>
<h4 class="mb-0"><a href="https://therivardreport.com/coronavirus-recession-experts-say-economic-fallout-tough-to-predict/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"> Coronavirus Recession? Experts Say Economic Fallout Tough to Predict </a></h4>
<p><em>The Rivard Report</em>, April 22, 2020 <br/> &#8220;One of the things that&#8217;s clear is that, in many ways, this recession is going to have a substantially greater impact on the economy than the Great Recession.&#8221; <br/> <strong>&#8212; Thomas Tunstall, senior director of research at UTSA&#8217;S Institute for Economic Development</strong></p>

<p><em>Psychology Today</em>, April 20, 2020 <br/> &#8220;In short, COVID-19 has changed the way we view and navigate the world. In the ordinary course of life, we operate based on a set of fixed beliefs, sometimes called schemas, and automatic responses, often habits. When too many of these patterns change quickly, we can experience what psychologists call dissociation. Suddenly, the world around us, our perceptions of ourselves and others, even our emotional responses and identity seem unfamiliar.&#8221; <br/> <strong>&#8212; Dr. Mary McNaughton-Cassill, professor of clinical psychology</strong></p>

<p><em>Fifth Domain</em>, April 18, 2020 <br/> &#8220;Coronavirus (COVID-19) is a perfect case study for cybersecurity. Why? The type and depth of response needed to battle a pandemic is similar to the level and depth of response needed to ward off cyberattacks. Moreover, in each scenario, some who are infected will survive while others, unfortunately, will succumb to their infections.&#8221; <br/> <strong>&#8212; Shouhuai Xu, a professor of computer science and leads the UTSA Laboratory for Cybersecurity Dynamics, which pioneered the nation&#8217;s first Cyber Agility Framework</strong></p>

<p><em>San Antonio Express-News</em>, April 16, 2020 <br/> &#8220;There is a world of difference between the ethical rules that govern the care of patients and the ethical rules that govern public health. Clinical ethics prioritize each individual and leave little room for utilitarian calculations.
