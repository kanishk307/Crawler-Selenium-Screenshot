<p>Washburn University students who need immediate financial assistance to stay in school are eligible for grants. Grants can be used for rent, bills, food and other basic needs. Applications are accepted on an ongoing basis. <a href="https://www.wualumni.org/ichabodsmovingforward" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Click here to learn more, donate or apply for a grant</a>.</p>
<p>Ichabods Moving Forward (IMF) is a student-led philanthropic organization sponsored by the Washburn University Alumni Association and Foundation. IMF supports an emergency assistance fund for students going through unforeseen hardship.</p>
<p><br/><br/><strong>Bods Feeding Bods Pantry</strong></p>
<p>The Bods Feeding Bods Pantry is still open for anyone in the Washburn community who may need food and commodities. For the remainder of the semester, Bods Feeding Bods, located in Kuehne Hall 101, will be open Monday - Saturday, 3 -5 p.m. Bring a valid WU ID to get access. If you are unable to access the pantry during those hours, contact any of the below departments to make an appointment.</p>
<ul>
<li>Counseling Services -- 670-3100</li>
<li>Learning in the Community (LinC) -- 670-1950</li>
<li>Mabee Library -- 670-2485</li>
<li>Office of the Associate Dean for Student Affairs -- 670-1672</li>
<li>Residential Living -- 670-1065</li>
<li>Washburn Police Department -- 670-1151</li>
</ul>
<p>Due to stay-at-home orders and remote work, not all of these offices may be available at all times. If access is needed outside of Washburn University&#8217;s or the pantry&#8217;s normal hours of operation (within reason), Washburn University police officers and the RA on duty in the residence halls have the ability to assist individuals.</p>
<p>We expect need to increase as the ramifications of COVID-19 continue. A donation barrel is located just outside of the food pantry for those who are able to donate. Most-needed items include canned fruit; grains such as rice, ramen and pasta; shelf stable proteins such as peanut butter and canned chicken; canned &#8220;meals&#8221; such as soups, ravioli and beef stew; cereal and shelf stable milk; and hygiene products such as tampons, shampoo, soap and toilet paper (even if it is one roll in a plastic bag).</p></content>

                        <content><p>The federal government has provided emergency relief funding for student grants through the CARES Act. In addition to the CARES Act funding, Washburn has secured additional financial resources to assist students who may be experiencing financial difficulties. Students who have been financially impacted due to this pandemic may be eligible to receive one-time financial assistance.<br/> <br/><strong>Assistance</strong></p>
<p>Students may apply for one-time assistance with specific expenses related to housing, food, health care, course materials, technology and/or child care. Awards will range from $100 to $6195. We will continue to award until all funds are exhausted.<br/> <br/><strong>Eligibility</strong></p>
<p>All degree-seeking students who were enrolled during as of March 13, 2020, are eligible for one-time assistance from these funds. If you have received aid from a campus or college emergency fund before this date, you are still eligible to apply for this funding. Please request funds only if you are in immediate need.</p>
<p>We encourage students with urgent needs to apply once for emergency relief funds. We cannot guarantee the fulfillment of a second application at this time. As we process requests, we will review the fund balance and notify students if we have resources available to fulfill more requests.<br/>Additional funds may be available to students who are enrolled in the summer 2020 terms.<br/> <br/><strong>Application Process</strong></p>
<p>To apply for funding, complete and submit the application, checking every category from which you need assistance. Please indicate on the application if you have requested funding from another source in the past few months. There are many students facing unprecedented challenges due to COVID-19, and our goal is to offer support to the largest number possible. We will accept applications until funds are exhausted.

<p>The financial aid office is still committed to serving the Washburn community and may be able to assist students experiencing financial distress during the COVID-19 crisis. Options will vary depending on students&#8217; Title IV aid eligibility and extenuating circumstances. The financial aid office must assess each student on a case-by-case basis to find the best possible solution. This is a complex process and each answer is unique.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><strong>Scholarships</strong></p>
<p>Accommodations will be made for students with renewable scholarships that missed renewal requirements as a result of COVID-19. The financial aid office will assist with the following accommodations:</p>
<ul>
<li>Allow amnesty for renewal requirements for the 2019-2020 semesters</li>
<li>If future renewal requirements are not met, the financial aid office will remove the spring 2020 semester and recalculate the renewal requirements</li>
<li>If future renewal requirements are still not met after the recalculation, students may submit a statement explaining their extenuating circumstances to <a href="mailto:financialaid@washburn.edu">financialaid@washburn.edu</a>.</li>

                        <content><p>In response to the expanding global disruption caused by the spread of COVID-19 and the responsibility we owe to our students, faculty, staff and community, we have made the difficult decision to cancel all Washburn University study abroad programs scheduled to depart in May, June &amp; July with immediate effect. The latest updates from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the U.S. and foreign governments have led us to take this action.</p>
<p>We know that, for some, this end to ambiguity will come as a relief, and that for others this will be truly awful news. We, too, are disappointed that programs are canceled in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, we must put the safety and wellbeing of our students, faculty, staff and community above all other concerns, and we believe that this is the best path forward at this time.</p>
<p>The OIP will refund the WU Study Abroad Application fee for participants and work with the Business Office to refund additional fees where possible. We will work with the Endowment &amp; VPAA to apply scholarship awards for students who have incurred non-refundable fees. For students who have not incurred fees we will defer scholarships for future program participation where possible.</p>
<p>We are asking our faculty who are leading programs to contact the travel providers to see what refunds are possible. For credit-bearing courses, we are asking faculty members to design alternative course requirements.</p>
<p>This cancellation decision does not apply to any Washburn University study abroad programs that have already departed, although we strongly encourage those on current programs to return home as soon as feasible. Travelers are urged to keep current on the spread of the virus and the latest travel advisories by visiting the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website at <a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/destinations/list/">https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/destinations/list/</a>.&#160;</p>
<p>During this time the campus community should also stay apprised of the extent of the virus and the most current travel advisories at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website at <a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/destinations/list/">https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/destinations/list/</a>.&#160;</p></content>

                        <content><span>Washburn University sent a notice today to students living on campus that the university is closing its residence halls. However, the university will allow some students with special circumstances to keep living on campus with continued access to a limited food service.</span><br/><br/><span>&#8220;Following spring break, access to residence halls has been limited to those who received special approval to return to campus housing,&#8221; according to Eric Grospitch, vice president of student life. &#8220;As we continue to work to protect the health and safety or our community, we have decided to close our residence halls for the remainder of the semester and restrict living on-campus to a limited number of students who have no other option.&#8221;</span><br/><br/><span>Decisions are being made on an individual basis, but in general, students who will be allowed to remain on campus will have special circumstances, including:</span><br/>
<ul>
<li>Students whose permanent residence is outside of the United States, and the student is unable to travel to their home country.</li>
<li>Students whose academic department has deemed and verified their internship, clinical, or practicum will continue and requires the student&#8217;s on-site presence. In addition, the student must have accepted that arrangement.</li>
<li>The student has personal circumstances such as a student who is part of the foster care system, whose home community is quarantined or where returning home represents a health/safety threat.</li>
</ul>
<span>&#8220;This has been a difficult decision in a period of change and uncertainty,&#8221; Grospitch said, &#8220;but we feel this is the best way to protect the health and safety of all our students.&#8221;</span><br/><br/><span>Students who are moving out of the residence halls are required to make an appointment with the Office of Residence Life to retrieve their belongings. Move out will begin on March 20 and conclude no later than April 1. Students arriving without an appointment will not be given access to the residence halls and they will be limited to no more than two guests to assist in the process.</span><br/><br/><span>Students moving out of residence halls will receive a pro-rated refund for both room fees and their dining plans. Details on that refund are still being finalized.</span></content>

<p>20.2&#160; Definitions.</p>
<p><strong>20.2.1</strong>&#160; <strong>&#8220;Communicable Disease&#8221;</strong> is an infectious disease transmissible (as from person to person) by direct or indirect contact with an affected individual, including by not limited to, hepatitis A, B and C, tuberculosis, rubella, chicken pox, shingles, influenza, measles, meningitis, COVID-19 and others as may be identified by local, state and/or federal agencies.</p>
<p><strong>20.2.2 &#8220;Direct or Indirect Contact&#8221;.&#160; </strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>&#8220;Direct Contact&#8221; </strong>occurs when there is a physical contact between an infected person or a susceptible person.</li>
<li><strong>&#8220;Indirect Contact&#8221; </strong>occurs when there is no direct human-to-human contact. Indirect contact may occur in several ways, including but limited to, when an infected person sneezes or coughs and the infectious droplets are inhaled, when a healthy person touches a contaminated object or surface and then touch their hands, eyes, nose or mouth prior to following universal precautions.</li>

Students who have a Communicable disease and may be at risk for transmitting the illness through direct or indirect contact to other students, faculty and/or staff should notify Student Health promptly.&#160;</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Employees who present a health risk to other students, faculty and/or staff should conduct themselves responsibly for their own protection and the protection of others in the community, follow universal precautions as appropriate, and not knowingly engage in any activity which creates a material risk of transmission to others.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>

                        <content><p><strong>WASHBURN TECH UPDATE (May 1, 2020)</strong><br/>Beginning May 4, Washburn Tech will gradually reopen specific areas of<br/>campus to allow students to complete their programs as well as sit for<br/>certification exams specific to their fields of study.</p>
<p>In preparation, students were notified this past week of their individual<br/>completion requirements. In addition, Washburn Tech instructors and staff are undergoing safety training to provide the best possible environment for<br/>students who return to campus. These protocols include the distribution of<br/>Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) such as masks and gloves, as well as<br/>the constant cleaning of surfaces in classrooms, labs and offices.</p>
<p>The following timeline has been established:</p>
<p><strong>May 4-8:</strong><br/>Small groups of students will return to campus to take the proctored<br/>exams necessary to complete their programs. The Regional Simulation<br/>Center, utilized by health care disciplines, will reopen to small groups of<br/>students who need to finish clinical testing. Washburn Tech&#8217;s Academy<br/>of Cosmetology will reopen on May 4 to students who will be scheduled<br/>on a rotating basis. Salon services are not available to the public.</p>
<p><strong>May 11-15:</strong><br/>Small groups of students who need to complete hands-on lab work will<br/>return to campus. These students will be scheduled on a staggered<br/>basis to allow for social distancing and safety measures. The<br/>completion time, for these students, varies among programs and<br/>students. Some students could finish in May while others may not<br/>complete until sometime in July.</p>
<p><strong>For Your Protection:</strong><br/>Washburn Tech is taking multiple precautions to safeguard the health of our<br/>students, instructors and staff. Each person will be issued two masks and<br/>gloves. You may also provide your own masks, if preferred. The cloth masks, Washburn Tech provides, may be washed and reused. Students, instructors and staff are strongly encouraged to wear these items.<br/>Social distancing practices will be implemented and plexiglass shields will be installed. Washburn Tech&#8217;s maintenance crew will diligently and continually clean surfaces in classroom, lab and office spaces.<br/>Students, who spend the day at Washburn Tech, should bring their own lunch.No food service or vending machines will be available.</p>
<p>Students will not be allowed to go outside during classroom breaks. In<br/>addition, students should not linger outside the classroom or in parking lots<br/>before or after class to eliminate the gathering of groups.</p>
<p>If a student is sick or not feeling well, he or she is required to stay home.</p>
<p><strong>Graduate Recognition:</strong><br/>Celebrating our graduates is very important to the Washburn Tech family. As we monitor the situation surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic, we will make every effort to create a way to highlight your wonderful accomplishments. Stay tuned!</p>
<p><strong>Fall 2020:</strong><br/>Washburn Tech administrators and instructors are preparing several<br/>educational plans to best meet the needs of our students in the fall semester.</p>
<p>As health experts predict a resurgence this fall of COVID-19 cases, Washburn Tech is creating a mixed modality model of learning in which students could learn both in the lab and online. As events, out of our control change, Washburn Tech is working to be prepared while prioritizing the health and safety of our students, instructors and staff.</p>
<p>New Student Orientations (NSOs) will be available virtually this summer,<br/>rather than on-campus. Details will be relayed soon.</p>
<p>If you have questions about NSOs or the fall semester, please call<br/>785.670.2100 and ask for a Washburn Tech admissions counselor or career<br/>advisor.</p>
<p><strong>Testing for Incoming Students:</strong><br/>Entrance testing will resume May 4 on the Washburn Tech campus. Incoming students, who would like to test, must have an application on file with Washburn Tech to be eligible. To schedule a testing appointment, call<br/>785.670.3343. If you are testing, PPE is strongly encouraged on campus and social distancing measures will be taken in the testing center.</p>
<p><strong>Laptop Check-in:</strong><br/>Washburn Tech&#8217;s IT Support is offering a drive-through return for students<br/>who checked-out a laptop during the current semester. To schedule a drop off time, call 785.670.3000 or contact Washburn Tech&#8217;s manager of user and network operations at derek.kucharczyk@washburn.edu</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>3/24/20</p>
<p>Washburn Tech&#8217;s campus is closed with only essential personnel on site. Classes are now online and will continue until further notice. All students should be monitoring their email daily and are required to log in to Washburn Tech&#8217;s online instruction platform, D2L, at https://d2l.washburn.edu/d2l/login. Instructors will provide program information and guidance.<br/><br/>Our main goal is to stay connected to our students and to keep them engaged in the learning process. <br/><br/><strong>Program Completion</strong>:<br/><br/>Working with our instructors, our management team has identified several programs that can be completed this semester using D2L. Students, both high school and post-secondary, will be notified through their instructors.<br/><br/>Several programs, however, cannot be completed online due to a hands-on component of the coursework. Washburn Tech is working on plans that will enable students to complete those competencies once the campus reopens. At this time, we anticipate the possibility of lab instruction sometime during the summer. Setting a timeline, at this point, is not possible.<br/><br/>High school students, unable to complete their program by the end of the semester, will receive &#8220;incomplete&#8221; grades which will be changed once they have completed their program. We are working with high school counselors and state educators to ensure these grades have no effect on a student&#8217;s educational standing in the fall.<br/><br/>A listing of all programs and their completion status will be distributed by the end of the week.<br/><br/><strong>Testing</strong>:<br/><br/>Our admissions team is looking at various testing options and enrollment requirements for students wanting to attend Washburn Tech for the 2020 Fall semester.

<p>Washburn Tech is developing plans to help as many students as possible complete their programs in light of the COVID-19 pandemic. To stay within the parameters set forth by the Kansas Governor&#8217;s Office and CDC guidelines, Washburn Tech is moving all courses online beginning Monday, March 23.<br/> <br/> Washburn Tech offers more than 40 programs but not all lend themselves to web-based learning due to hands-on components of the curriculum. Assessment of program delivery is currently underway with the goal of identifying coursework that can be completed this semester or at a later date and how that applies to students, both high school and post-secondary. Determinations will be announced soon.<br/> <br/> &#8220;Our goal for every student is to complete his or her program,&#8221; said Dr. Gerald Bayens, dean of Washburn Tech. &#8220;Our plan of action might include mixed-mode learning, providing modules for coursework that has a hands-on component. We are truly proceeding in uncharted territory.&#8221;<br/> <br/> In addition, Washburn Tech has temporarily closed the Little Learners at Washburn Tech as well as the Washburn Tech Academy of Cosmetology Salon at 109 SW 29th St. Commencement exercises scheduled for May are being postponed.<br/> <br/> Washburn Tech students are required to log in to Washburn Tech&#8217;s online instructional platform, D2L, on Monday, March 23. Guidance is available at Washburn Tech&#8217;s COVID-19 update site at <a href="https://washburn.edu/techcovid">https://washburn.edu/techcovid</a>.

We have worked together to temporarily adjust several academic policies for the spring 2020 semester to support academic success under these extraordinary circumstances.</p>
<p>These temporary policies apply to part-of-term courses (short-term courses) that began on 2/15/2020 or later and full-term courses in the spring 2020 semester. The policies address grading options, incomplete grades, withdrawals, repeats and academic suspension.&#160;</p>

<p>This has been a stressful time for everyone&#8212;students, faculty, and staff&#8212;and we appreciate everyone coming together to make the best of a difficult situation. We hope that these temporary policies will help relieve some of the anxiety many students may be feeling.</p></content>
