<div class="panel">
<p>ASU is set to resume on-campus, in-person classes on Aug. 20, 2020. </p>
<p>Until then, students are attending classes digitally (with the exception of a small number of summer session B courses that do not lend themselves to remote instruction), and the majority of faculty and staff are telecommuting.</p>
<p>Faculty and staff may access their offices. However, they should first check with their supervisor to establish a time and for information about designated building entry points to ensure appropriate social (physical) distancing and proper health screenings.</p>
<p>If students need access to labs, studios, or performance spaces necessary to complete a summer project, faculty need to contact Facilities Management. Faculty and deans also will need to contact FM to arrange for proper health screenings and essential cleaning. Appropriate social (physical) distancing must be observed and enforced. Reach Facilities Management at 480-965-3633 or facman@asu.edu.</p>
<p>ASU Sandra Day O’Connor College of Law students must make an appointment for building access and may call: 480-965-6188.</p>
<p>For students who were previously using ASU computer labs or who do not have a computer or internet access at this time, the University Technology Office is able to help, based on a limited supply of devices. Laptops and hot spots can be reserved by applicable students through a checkout process at the ASU Library, and the equipment will be available for pickup or shipping at this time. Technical support for setup will be provided by UTO, and students will be able to turn to the <a href="https://uto.asu.edu/ExperienceCenter">ASU Experience Center</a> help desk for additional support as needed. <a href="https://lib.asu.edu/laptops-and-hotspots">Start the checkout process</a>.</p>
<p>If students need to check out books or other materials from the ASU Library, they can find details on how to do so on the <a href="https://lib.asu.edu/librarychannel/ASU-Library-now-open-remote-services-only">ASU Library blog</a>.</p>
<p>Following California Governor Gavin Newsom’s March 19 shelter-in-place order, all ASU offices in California are closed until further notice. ASU offices in Washington, D.C., are closed until further notice; for questions or issues with the Washington location, contact Roxanne Ladd at Roxanne.Ladd@asu.edu or 202-446-0381.</p>

<div class="panel">
<p>ASU works in close coordination with the Arizona Department of Health Services and the Maricopa County Department of Public Health and will continue deferring to public health agencies regarding disclosure of positive test results and related information. Public health officials will advise ASU if additional disclosure measures are necessary. ASU will work with the county and the state on tracing and notifying anyone who may have been in close contact with a positive case.</p>
<p>Any member of the ASU community who shows symptoms of COVID-19 is required to self-isolate upon showing symptoms. Individuals showing symptoms of COVID-19 should not wait until they are tested or receive test results to begin self-isolating. Individuals who have been in close contact with someone who has tested positive for COVID-19 should also self-isolate.</p>
<p>Regardless of where the individual lives, the health care protocol is the same for anyone who has tested positive: self-isolation for the period of time necessary per Maricopa County Health Department guidance (currently 10 days plus no symptoms for three days), regular (remote) health screenings, no-contact food delivery, and (remote) personal and emotional support. Students should contact ASU Health Services at 480-965-3349 for more information and assistance. Employees should contact their supervisor, who will work with Employee Wellness to provide information and assistance.</p>

<div class="panel">
<p><a href="https://asuforyou.asu.edu/">ASU for You</a> is a new website that gathers some of Arizona State University’s most valuable learning tools <strong><a href="https://asuforyou.asu.edu/">in one place</a></strong> to meet learners where they are, both in terms of physical location and educational needs. As COVID-19 precautions are taken to ensure the safety of our communities, we must find new methods to keep learning on track for everyone at every level. </p>
<p>The new site includes many learning tools at no cost such as virtual field trips; library access; video lessons, labs and simulations in K-12 subject areas; badge and certificate programs in areas such as health and well-being, smart cities and environmental science; tutoring, online courses and training videos for teachers or parents teaching from home; and courses for college credit. </p>
<p>ASU for You is part of the university’s ongoing commitment to take fundamental responsibility for the communities it serves and provide access to all learners anywhere in the world. While these resources are valuable at any time, they are particularly relevant today given the circumstances we all face with COVID-19.</p>
<p><a href="https://asuforyou.asu.edu/">ASU For You</a> will be updated regularly with new resources and tools. The university encourages people to share these resources with colleagues, family and friends — anyone who can take advantage of these tools.</p>

<h4 class="accordion-new" style="border-bottom: 3px solid #ffc627;"><a id="g7" name="g7" title="g7"></a><strong>With ASU recently receiving funding from the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act (CARES Act), how does it intend to distribute those resources?</strong></h4>
<div class="panel">
<p><strong>ASU and the CARES Act</strong></p>
<p>Arizona State University applauds the commitment of the federal government to come to the financial aid of students and families, businesses and public institutions across America through congressional enactment of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act. The university is particularly appreciative of the relief the CARES Act provides to institutions of higher learning, including approximately $63.5 million that will be allocated for ASU.</p>
<p>ASU signed and returned the Certification and Agreement forms to the U.S. Department of Education. The federal government stipulates that a minimum of $31.7 million be awarded for emergency financial aid grants to students. Our goal with that funding will be to support students first and foremost in continuing their academic studies. </p>
<p>ASU has a large student population with varying needs. When ASU has finalized the mechanism for the distribution of the funds, the university will report back to the U.S. Department of Education, the CARES Act funds will be released to ASU by the federal government, and the CARES Act funds in turn will be distributed to students.</p>
<p>In the meantime, ASU is continuing to work with all students who have expressed concern about their financial circumstances. In the coming weeks, ASU will consider uses of the remaining funds, particularly in the context of promoting student continuity during COVID-19 and into the next academic year. </p>
<p>Separate from the CARES Act, ASU has distributed nearly $1 million in emergency grants to students from more than 20 different areas of the university who needed immediate help.</p>
<p>About 1,400 students received the emergency grants, which ranged from $100 to $2,400; the average award amount was about $700.</p>
<p>The emergency grants were provided to students to cover expenses related to their education, including housing/rent, meals, flights home and medical expenses. In most cases, students filled out a form or provided information regarding their individual circumstances so their cases could be reviewed.</p>
<p>Numerous ASU departments worked to facilitate the emergency grants. Students may have worked directly with their colleges, through the Dean of Students or through Financial Aid and Scholarship Services.</p>
<p>The university also has helped students in many other ways during the pandemic including:</p>
<ul><li>Loaning more than 2,000 laptops and hundreds of Wi-Fi hot spots to continue instruction uninterrupted.</li>
<li>Providing essential services during the pandemic including telehealth for medical and counseling needs.</li>
<li>Continuing employment through the spring semester for student workers.</li>
<li>Expanding opportunities for internships throughout the summer. </li>

<p>Right now, our intent is to host full-immersion on-campus classes this fall, and we’ve begun planning to do so. We know that COVID-19 will continue to be present in the future and that containment strategies, such as some form of physical distancing or modifications to food service, may need to be implemented in August or later. ASU will implement whatever safety measures and protocols are necessary to provide a safe environment for students and staff. </p>
</div>
<h4 class="accordion-new" style="border-bottom: 3px solid #ffc627;"><a id="fa2" name="fa2" title="fa2"></a><strong>What modifications do you think might be needed to campus life?</strong></h4>
<div class="panel">
<p>Campus life will look different in many ways, and we will all need to make adjustments. With the cooperation and care of every member of the Sun Devil community, we’re confident we can all have a successful fall semester.</p>
<p>All ASU buildings – including residence halls and classrooms — will receive a thorough cleaning with medical-grade products followed by a fogging system cleanse prior to occupancy this fall. During the semester, all buildings will receive a thorough cleaning once per day, and high-touch surfaces will be cleaned twice daily. </p>
<p>Everyone, including faculty, staff, students and visitors, will be required to wear face coverings in classrooms, labs, offices and community spaces. Students and employees should monitor their temperature each day they’re on campus. If their temperature is 100.4 degrees or higher, they should stay home and seek health advice. </p>
<p>All on-campus ASU students and employees will be required to participate in a “Community of Care” training program designed to inform, educate and encourage healthy living and learning on campus and as a member of the ASU community. ASU will also have a community-wide communications campaign to remind students, employees and campus visitors of public health protocols to help prevent the spread of COVID-19.</p>
<p>All on-campus students will receive a “Community of Care” kit containing face coverings, a thermometer, hand sanitizer and other items for use in maintaining their health and wellness on campus. The university will have these items available for restocking. Employees will receive PPE and supplies though planned departmental distribution.</p>
<p>Sneeze guards and Plexiglas barrier installations will be used in high-frequency visitor areas, touchless technology will be used where appropriate, and social distancing will be observed.</p>

<h4 class="accordion-new" style="border-bottom: 3px solid #ffc627;"><a id="fa5" name="fa5" title="fa5"></a><strong>Are you planning to implement COVID-19 testing for all students and employees? </strong></h4>
<div class="panel">
<p>All ASU students and employees will be pre-screened for information related to prior COVID-19 testing and travel. ASU will follow <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/index.html">CDC guidance</a> pertaining to isolation requirements for individuals traveling domestically or internationally. <br /><br /> Testing will be available on all campuses — at the start of the semester and throughout the semester — for any student and employee who needs it. In particular, we encourage anyone who is experiencing COVID-19 symptoms or may have been exposed to someone with COVID-19 to request a test. </p>
<p>The university houses a fully CLIA-certified* and FDA Emergency Use Authorization approved testing lab at the Biodesign Institute to perform a diagnostic qPCR test for those individuals who may have an active coronavirus infection. The ASU clinical testing lab has implemented testing for frontline health care workers, first responders and critical infrastructure employees since April. ASU will now provide a <a href="https://asunow.asu.edu/20200526-discoveries-arizona-state-university-develops-saliva-based-covid-19-test">saliva-based COVID-19 test</a> and will prioritize testing for any student or employee who is exhibiting symptoms or may have been exposed to someone with COVID-19. Turnaround time for test results is 24-48 hours. ASU has staff available to support contact tracing as needed.</p>
</div>
<h4 class="accordion-new" style="border-bottom: 3px solid #ffc627;"><a id="fa51" name="fa51" title="fa51"></a><strong>Will COVID-19 testing be free?</strong></h4>
<div class="panel">
<p>ASU will be making COVID-19 virus testing available to students and employees for the fall 2020 academic semester. Benefits-eligible faculty and staff will be able to be tested,  free of charge and co-pays, by presenting an insurance card and Sun Card at the testing site. <strong>It is important to note that benefits-eligible employees already can obtain a test for themselves or their dependents through their primary care providers, and the cost is covered by their group health insurance, with no copay. </strong>    </p>
<p>ASU employees who get their benefits through other sources, such their parents’, spouse’s or partner’s plans, will be able to obtain a free test by presenting their insurance card and ASU ID card at the testing site. ASU employees with no benefits from any other source can still obtain a free test with their Sun Card.</p>
<p>Students can currently access testing through ASU Health Services for free.</p>

<p>We know athletics and other events are an integral part of the Sun Devil community. While plans will continue to develop, whether the university can host athletic and other events on campus will be determined at a later date and will be contingent on public health circumstances at the time.</p>
<p>In accordance with the NCAA, the Pac-12 Conference, public health officials and university guidance, Sun Devil Athletics is planning to allow student-athletes to return to voluntary workouts in our athletics facilities in a phased-in approach, beginning June 15, 2020. </p>
<p>The Pac-12 Conference assembled a team of medical and infectious disease experts to develop best practices for member institutions to incorporate in the return to voluntary workouts. With this as a guiding principle, along with input from public and campus health officials/physicians, Sun Devil Athletics is establishing protocols that will be closely adhered to as we welcome student-athletes back to campus in phased groups over the next few months.   </p>

<div class="panel">
<p>Consistent with our efforts to always meet learners where they are, ASU will offer courses in a variety of learning environments to accommodate students’ needs. </p>
<p><strong>For the majority of classes,</strong> immersion (on-campus) students will have access to three learning environments: </p>
<ol><li><strong>ASU immersion:</strong> On-campus, in-person, technology-enhanced learning environment.</li>
<li><strong>ASU Sync:</strong> Synchronous, technology-enhanced and fully interactive remote learning using live lectures via Zoom. This approach can be used simultaneously with in-person instruction to accommodate students in different circumstances and enable social distancing in classrooms or as stand-alone technology. It offers the benefits of face-to-face instruction in an interactive, group-learning environment.</li>
<li><strong>iCourses: </strong>Courses delivered entirely online with lectures available on demand. </li>
</ol><p>Our goal is to provide a quality learning environment that adheres to public health and safety guidelines from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. These three learning environments will give students the flexibility they need. <strong>Many classes will include a blend of in-person and ASU Sync experiences.</strong> Some labs, clinical experiences and fine arts courses that do not lend themselves to remote instruction will only be available through on-campus, in-person instruction. </p>

<h4 class="accordion-new" style="border-bottom: 3px solid #ffc627;"><a id="fa16" name="fa16" title="fa16"></a><strong>I’m an employee. What if I have an underlying health condition and am concerned about returning to campus?</strong></h4>
<div class="panel">
<p>The Americans with Disabilities Act prohibits employers from making disability-related inquiries of employees. This includes asking an employee if they have a compromised immune system, chronic health condition or a condition that puts them in a high-risk category. Additionally, supervisors should not exclude an employee from the workplace solely because they have a medical condition that places them at a higher risk for severe illness due to COVID-19.  </p>
<p>If an employee has been asked to return to campus and indicates that they are unwilling to return due to being high risk, refer the employee to an<a href="https://cfo.asu.edu/workplace-accommodations"> ADA consultant</a> to discuss a possible accommodation that may allow them to perform the essential functions of their position. Because the employee’s request may involve information about their health, it is important that you refer the request to an ADA consultant rather than handling it yourself, so that the university can ensure that confidentiality requirements are followed. Approved accommodations may include remote work, changes to the employee’s schedule or work location, or other accommodations. The ADA consultant will work with you to discuss the options that may be feasible for the particular employee.</p>
<p>If an ADA accommodation is not approved, refer the employee to the Office of Human Resources<a href="https://cfo.asu.edu/benefits"> Benefits Department</a> to explore whether they are eligible for leave under university policy.</p>

<p>According to the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/about-face-coverings.html">CDC</a>, cloth face coverings may be made at home from common materials at low cost. The CDC <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/how-to-make-cloth-face-covering.html">states</a> that cloth face coverings should include multiple layers of fabric. </p>
</div>
<h4 class="accordion-new" style="border-bottom: 3px solid #ffc627;"><a id="fc4" name="fc4" title="fc4"></a><strong>Why is a face covering recommended?</strong></h4>
<div class="panel">
<p>The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends face coverings when distancing is difficult to maintain. COVID-19 spreads mainly from person to person through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes and also if someone speaks or sings. These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of those nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs. Studies and evidence on infection control indicate these droplets usually travel around 6 feet or two meters, about two arms’ lengths. Everyone is required to wear a face cover while in ASU buildings and community spaces.</p>
</div>
<h4 class="accordion-new" style="border-bottom: 3px solid #ffc627;"><a id="fc5" name="fc5" title="fc5"></a><strong>Are face coverings recommended even if distancing can be maintained?</strong></h4>
<div class="panel">
<p>The CDC currently recommends wearing face coverings when distancing measures are difficult to maintain. Everyone is required to wear a face cover while in ASU buildings and community spaces, regardless of distance.</p>
<p>Face covers can help prevent pre-symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals from inadvertently spreading the virus to others. They are meant to protect others in case you are sick. Wear a face cover or a face shield in public.</p>
<p>On campus, this could be the situation in many community spaces: classrooms, offices, laboratories, sidewalks, bike racks, elevators, hallways, or when riding in vehicles or when taking public transportation. Because there is not enough data yet to precisely define the duration of time that constitutes a prolonged exposure, the CDC recommendation is currently 15 minutes of close contact to be used as a benchmark. More information is available on the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/php/public-health-recommendations.html">CDC website</a>. </p>

<div class="panel">
<ol><li>Wash hands with soap and water or apply hand sanitizer first.</li>

<div class="panel">
<p>Students coming to campus for the fall semester will receive “Community of Care” kits containing face coverings, a thermometer, hand sanitizer and other items for use in maintaining health and wellness on campus. The university will have these items available throughout campus for restocking. </p>
<p>Faculty and staff will receive similar supplies. There will be a push of face coverings, hand sanitizer and cleaning products to all departments via mail codes in the latter part of July. These supplies will provide enough face coverings for all employees to have two each, as well as hand sanitizer and cleaning products for all work areas. This initial push will be centrally funded, and there is no action required to request them. Following the initial push, replenishment supplies can be ordered from central inventory via FMS Workday and will be available at cost and delivered the next day in most cases.</p>
<p>For on-site employees who require supplies prior to late July, follow the normal procedures of your department’s financial staff to order supplies through FMS Workday.</p>
<p>Individuals who have a medical condition or disability and are unable to wear a cloth face covering may engage in the ADA interactive process to identify a reasonable accommodation.

<div class="panel">
<p>No. Everyone is required to wear a face cover while in ASU buildings and community spaces. The CDC recommends wearing face coverings in public settings where other social distancing measures are difficult to maintain, especially in areas of significant community-based transmission. Data are insufficient to precisely define the duration of time that constitutes a prolonged exposure. According to the CDC, “recommendations vary on the length of time of exposure, but 15 minutes of close exposure can be used as an operational definition.”</p>
<p>Social distancing, also called “physical distancing,” means keeping space between yourself and other people outside of your home. To practice social or physical distancing: stay at least 6 feet — about 2 arms’ length — from other people; do not gather in groups; and stay out of crowded places and avoid mass gatherings.</p>

<div class="panel">
<p>The CDC recommends washing cloth face coverings after each use. Cloth face coverings may be washed at the end of the day as long as the cloth face covering was removed and stored following ASU guidelines.</p>
<p>Cloth face coverings may be washed by hand or in a washing machine. Make sure to completely dry cloth face covering after washing. The CDC provides the instructions listed below.</p>
<p><strong>Washing machine</strong></p>
<ul><li>You can include your face covering with your regular laundry.</li>
<li>Use regular laundry detergent and the warmest appropriate water setting for the cloth used to make the face covering.</li>
</ul><p><strong>Washing by hand</strong></p>
<ul><li>Prepare a bleach solution by mixing:</li>
<ul><li>5 tablespoons (1/3 cup) household bleach per gallon of room-temperature water or</li>
<li>4 teaspoons household bleach per quart of room-temperature water</li>
</ul><li>Check the label to see if your bleach is intended for disinfection. Some bleach products, such as those designed for safe use on colored clothing, may not be suitable for disinfection. Ensure the bleach product is not past its expiration date. Never mix household bleach with ammonia or any other cleanser.</li>
<li>Soak the face covering in the bleach solution for 5 minutes.</li>

<h4 class="accordion-new" style="border-bottom: 3px solid #ffc627;"><a id="fc13" name="fc13" title="fc13"></a><strong>What are the guidelines for cleaning and reusing cloth face coverings used in laboratories?</strong></h4>
<div class="panel">
<p>Cloth face coverings are acceptable to wear in most research and teaching laboratories at ASU. However, wearing a face cover in some laboratories may present an added hazard. Always follow the safety plan for each laboratory. When used correctly, cloth face coverings used in laboratories will not be contaminated with any laboratory materials since they are worn on the face and not in direct contact with lab equipment or materials. If hazardous materials are known to have made contact with the cloth face covering — e.g., an accidental splash on the face — then follow regular accident procedures and discard the face covering as hazardous waste and replace as necessary.</p>
<p>As an additional precaution, it is recommended that cloth face coverings worn in labs are washed separately from other laundry or that a pre-wash step is included. Several options for washing separately or including a pre-wash steps are listed below.</p>
<ul><li>Wash cloth face coverings separately from regular laundry. Wash with hot water and soap, or add bleach.</li>
<li>Remove cloth face coverings in the lab after removing PPE and washing hands. Place them on a Ziploc bag. Pre-wash them by adding 1-2 teaspoons of soap, seal the Ziploc bag and rub the Ziploc bag from the outside to pre-launder the cloth face covering. Rinse with water and keep the cloth face covering in the Ziploc bag. Finish laundering them at home following the CDC instructions listed in the previous answer for hand washing or machine washing.</li>
<li>Remove cloth face coverings in the lab after removing PPE and washing hands. Store them in a plastic bag. Hand wash them at home following the CDC instructions listed in the previous answer.</li>

<h4 class="accordion-new" style="border-bottom: 3px solid #ffc627;"><a id="fc16" name="fc16" title="fc16"></a><strong>Is it recommended to cover one's eyes, such as with safety glasses or face shield?</strong></h4>
<div class="panel">
<p>If eye protection or a face shield is required for the job or task, then always wear the appropriate PPE. As for protecting the eyes and face additionally, the risk of infection by contact with eyes is currently suggested to be low. The CDC states the nose and mouth are the main routes of infection. Goggles protect eyes from splashes, sprays and droplets from all sides. Face shields can also protect the eyes and face, depending on the design.

<p>Individuals who have a medical condition or disability and are unable to wear a cloth face covering may engage in the ADA interactive process to identify a reasonable accommodation. Employees may initiate this process by contacting the <a href="https://cfo.asu.edu/workplace-accommodations">Office of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion</a>; students may contact the <a href="https://eoss.asu.edu/drc">Disability Resource Center</a>. Materials Management has a supply of clear face masks and clear face shields in stock for those with an approved ADA accommodation. Additionally, kits distributed to departments with cleaning supplies will include a limited number of face shields or clear masks for guests and visitors with ADA needs.</p>

<div class="panel">
<p>All buildings on all campuses are closed unless special arrangements are made. Faculty and staff will still have access to their offices. If students need to access particular buildings — such as for lab access or studio or performance spaces needed to complete a project — faculty will need to let Facilities Management know. Faculty and deans will need to work with Facilities Management to arrange for proper cleaning that will need to be done. Appropriate physical distancing must be observed and enforced. Reach Facilities Management at 480-965-3633 or <a href="mailto:facman@asu.edu">facman@asu.edu</a>.</p>
<p>Beginning July 1, certain academic buildings will be returned to an open state including card access and mechanical doors to facilitate in-person summer session B courses.</p>
<p>For students who were previously using ASU computer labs or who do not have a computer or internet access at this time, the University Technology Office is able to help, based on a limited supply of devices. Laptops and hot spots can be reserved by applicable students through a checkout process at the ASU Library, and the equipment will be available for pickup or shipping at this time. Technical support for setup will be provided by UTO, and students will be able to turn to the <a href="https://uto.asu.edu/ExperienceCenter">ASU Experience Center</a> help desk for additional support as needed. <a href="https://lib.asu.edu/laptops-and-hotspots">Start the checkout process</a>.</p>

<div class="panel">
<p>Some buildings have screeners at the entrance, but because of staffing levels not every building will have someone stationed at the door. For those buildings, ASU is asking that visitors ask themselves the following questions, the same used by the screeners according to CDC guidelines. Be honest; if you can say “yes” to any of these, please do not go inside. Go home and contact your health care provider and your supervisor before returning to campus. If we can help to meet your needs without you needing to enter the building, we will do so.</p>

<li>Have you had close contact with anyone who has tested positive for COVID-19, or who has been tested and is waiting for results while they had symptoms or in the two weeks before they began showing symptoms? Note: The CDC defines close contact as: a) being within approximately 6 feet (2 meters) of a COVID-19 case for a prolonged period of time; close contact can occur while caring for, living with, visiting, or sharing a health care waiting area or room with a COVID-19 case; or b) having direct contact with infectious secretions of a COVID-19 case (e.g., being coughed on).</li>

<p>Public drinking-water supplies are safe to drink; however, the surfaces around the fountain including the spout, button, lever and nozzles could pose a risk for the transmission of COVID-19 and other germs. Consider using only a clean cup or bottle before using the dispenser to prevent cross-contamination. In order to reduce risks, ensure neither your mouth nor your container makes contact with the spout of the fountain, and follow the below procedures. </p>
<ol><li>Test the water flow and let the water flow for 10 seconds to allow for fresh, clean water to come through prior to drinking. </li>

<div class="panel">
<p>The temperature of the water does not appear to be a consideration in hand washing, according to the CDC, and the faucet temperatures will remain the same. The key to good hand washing depends on the length of time for each type and amount of soil on the hands. Evidence suggests washing hands for about 15 to 30 seconds removes more germs from hands than washing for shorter periods. If a faucet is malfunctioning, please contact Facilities Management at 480-965-3633 or <a href="mailto:facman@asu.edu">facman@asu.edu</a>. </p>

<p>Signage will be placed on each laboratory listing the maximum occupancy and the required equipment to be worn. Employees and students will be required to wear a face cover while in ASU buildings and community spaces. </p>
<p>The CDC recommends wearing face coverings in public settings where other social distancing measures are difficult to maintain (e.g., grocery stores and pharmacies), especially in areas of significant community-based transmission. Data are insufficient to precisely define the duration of time that constitutes a prolonged exposure. According to the CDC, “recommendations vary on the length of time of exposure, but 15 minutes of close exposure can be used as an operational definition.”</p>

<h4 class="accordion-new" style="border-bottom: 3px solid #ffc627;"><a id="sa1" name="sa1" title="sa1"></a><strong>Will students have a choice in class delivery mode?</strong></h4>
<div class="panel">
<p><br /><strong>For the majority of classes,</strong> immersion (on-campus) students will have access to the following three learning environments: </p>
<ol><li><strong>ASU immersion:</strong> On-campus, in-person, technology-enhanced learning environment.</li>
<li><strong>ASU Sync:</strong> Synchronous, technology-enhanced and fully interactive remote learning using live lectures via Zoom. This approach can be used simultaneously with in-person instruction to accommodate students in different circumstances and enable social distancing in classrooms or as stand-alone technology. It offers the benefits of face-to-face instruction in an interactive, group-learning environment.</li>
<li><strong>iCourses:</strong> Courses delivered entirely online with lectures available on demand. </li>
</ol><p>Our goal is to provide a quality learning environment that adheres to public health and safety guidelines from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. These three learning environments will give students the flexibility they need. <strong>Many classes will include a blend of in-person and ASU Sync experiences.</strong> Some labs, clinical experiences and fine arts courses that do not lend themselves to remote instruction will only be available through on-campus, in-person instruction. </p>
<p><strong>Based on current public health information, face coverings will be required by everyone in buildings and community spaces on all campuses.</strong> The university will also implement increased cleaning protocols including daily cleaning of classrooms with two additional cleanings of high-touch surfaces, providing cleaning and sanitizing supplies in all classrooms for students, and reducing attendance in classrooms by half on alternating days. Those not attending in person on assigned days will participate in class through ASU Sync. <br /><br /><strong>Out-of-state and international students</strong> who wish to attend classes on campus but may not be able to arrive in time for the start of the semester will be given the opportunity to learn through ASU Sync for the first half of the semester, and if necessary, the full semester. Faculty will hold special office hours that accommodate different time zones.<br /><br /><strong>In addition,</strong> we recognize that our new and currently enrolled ASU Online students are also facing life and family challenges due to the pandemic. ASU Online success coaches are ready to assist students to resolve issues that arise, and online students have the opportunity to receive academic, service and personal support remotely. </p>
</div>
<h4 class="accordion-new" style="border-bottom: 3px solid #ffc627;"><a id="sa2" name="sa2" title="sa2"></a><strong>Can I change how I attend class midway through the semester?</strong></h4>
<div class="panel">
<p>Yes. Because of changing circumstances and the need for flexibility, students will be able to use various learning environments. Many classes this fall will be a blend of in-person and ASU Sync classes, where students will be in person on some days and will learn from live lectures in a Zoom setting on other days. </p>
<p>Some students may not be able to begin the semester on campus because of personal preference, travel restrictions, health needs or other reasons. They can move from Sync classes to in-person classes when able. </p>
<p>For example, out-of-state and international students who wish to attend classes on campus but may not be able to arrive in time for the start of the semester will be given the opportunity to learn through ASU Sync for the first half of the semester, and if necessary, the full semester. Faculty will hold special office hours that accommodate different time zones</p>

<p>Satisfactory academic progress measures three things: GPA standard (maintaining a minimum GPA), pace rate (passing 67% of attempted ASU credit hours) and maximum credit hours (maximum attempted credit hour limits for the degree program).</p>
<p>Since the Y grade is not a letter grade, it can only count toward the pace rate and maximum credit hours. If students do not meet the GPA standard, they can submit an appeal for the continuation of financial aid.</p>

<p>At ASU, online exams are proctored. Students take exams with their webcam on and a proctor monitoring them, and any looking at notes, talking to other people or other unauthorized actions are reported to the instructor. All violations of the Academic Integrity Policy are investigated. We expect all students to follow the <a href="https://provost.asu.edu/academic-integrity/honor-code" title="https://provost.asu.edu/academic-integrity/honor-code">ASU Student Honor Code</a>.</p>
<p>ASU’s proctoring solutions (Respondus Montitor/LockDown Browser) are integrated into Canvas, ASU’s learning management system. For any courses that do not use Canvas, ASU has RPNow. ASU may deploy additional tools as well. Faculty may also redesign a test to another form of assessment that discourages cheating.</p>

<p>
            ASU's summer sessions A and C, which began on May 18, will be offered through remote learning techniques including online and Zoom delivery. The university wants to ensure everyone has the opportunity to continue their studies, make up for a course you may have dropped, or get ahead so you might graduate sooner. We also want to ensure you can do this in a safe environment. Students are urged to register for courses so the university can be sure to accommodate all of their learning needs.
        </p>
<p>
            For summer session B, which begins July 1, we will limit almost all instruction to ASU Sync (using Zoom technology), ASU Online and ASU iCourses. A small number of courses in summer B session that do not lend themselves to remote instruction will be offered with in-person instruction on campus. For each of these courses, we will work with faculty and enrolled students on the following safety measures and protocols:
        </p>
<ul><li>
                Appropriate physical distancing measures are followed in the classroom.
            </li>
<li>
                At this point we are strongly recommending face coverings in classrooms and will communicate before July 1 if face coverings will be mandatory.
            </li>
<li>
                Health screenings before students enter the classroom, details of which can be found <a href="https://eoss.asu.edu/health/announcements/coronavirus/faqs#services-faq">here.</a>

<div class="panel">
<p>ASU fees are assessments established by student leadership in support of student activities. Given the unique current public health circumstance, some services are being offered in a slightly different format but they are all available. It is important to note that these fees, while a helpful and important contribution from students, do not cover the full operating expenses of these services. </p>
<p>Specifically with regard to recreation fees and athletics fees,<a href="https://fitness.asu.edu/home"> Sun Devil Fitness Center</a> is preparing to reopen for fall. In the meantime, it offers live classes via social media, fitness on demand, and a complete array of other services, such as nutrition and wellness coaching, in a virtual format. The athletics fee covers more than just athletics, including free exam-preparation courses and increases in research and teaching assistant stipends.</p>
<p>The entire ASU student community contributes to the cost of these programs and services, though personal usage from semester to semester may vary. We share in supporting the programs used by all, just as we share in using the programs — choosing the ones that best serve our personal interests at any particular point in the student journey. </p>

<h4 class="accordion-new" style="border-bottom: 3px solid #ffc627;"><a id="gs1" name="gs1" title="gs1"></a><strong>How should I hold my defense during summer 2020?</strong></h4>
<div class="panel">
<p>Defense committees, including students, should plan to participate remotely for defenses scheduled during the summer semester (through Aug. 11, 2020).</p>
</div>
<h4 class="accordion-new" style="border-bottom: 3px solid #ffc627;"><a id="gs2" name="gs2" title="gs2"></a><strong>Are there best practices to help students and committees as they plan for a remote defense?</strong></h4>
<div class="panel">
<p>Yes! There are many strategies that can be employed to ensure a smooth, virtual defense. The Graduate College has a <a href="https://graduate.asu.edu/current-students/completing-your-degree/about-your-defense">webpage</a> that includes a guide to online defenses to help with planning and conducting a remote defense.</p>
</div>
<h4 class="accordion-new" style="border-bottom: 3px solid #ffc627;"><a id="gs3" name="gs3" title="gs3"></a><strong>What about the Graduate College requirement to hold a public defense?</strong></h4>
<div class="panel">
<p>The requirement to hold public defenses is suspended for the duration of the coronavirus precautionary restriction on in-person instruction (that is, through Aug. 11); however, many programs are using Zoom to replicate the public part of the defense. Holding a virtual public defense can allow for audience members to join who might have otherwise participated in person, such as friends, family and colleagues. While this is certainly not required, it is an available option — and encouraged, if both student and committee agree. </p>
<p>Additionally, if for any reason either a faculty member or a student feels unsafe or prefers to participate in a defense remotely, even after campus returns to in-person instruction in fall 2020, the Graduate College will permit this option for any member of a final exam/defense.</p>
</div>
<h4 class="accordion-new" style="border-bottom: 3px solid #ffc627;"><a id="gs4" name="gs4" title="gs4"></a><strong>Can I still take my comprehensive exam this fall?</strong></h4>
<div class="panel">
<p>Your faculty committee and staff adviser can assist in determining your readiness to take the comprehensive exam for your program. You can discuss with them the topics and testing mode, as well as the requirements to take it. If you need to postpone taking the exam until spring, that may also be an option. Consult with your unit adviser and committee regarding all of your options.</p>
</div>
<h4 class="accordion-new" style="border-bottom: 3px solid #ffc627;"><a id="gs5" name="gs5" title="gs5"></a><strong>Do I have to hold my defense in person this fall?</strong></h4>
<div class="panel">
<p>If you and your faculty committee determine that you are ready to hold your defense in the fall, you may follow the guidelines found on the Graduation College website <a href="https://graduate.asu.edu/current-students/completing-your-degree/about-your-defense">here</a> to schedule it. You should consult with your committee and staff adviser to determine if Zoom will be utilized to hold the defense and if there will be an in-person component. Students conducting their defense in fall should be registered and follow graduation deadlines.</p>
</div>
<h4 class="accordion-new" style="border-bottom: 3px solid #ffc627;"><a id="gs6" name="gs6" title="gs6"></a><strong>What if I don’t feel comfortable coming to campus for my defense?</strong></h4>
<div class="panel">
<p>It is important to discuss with your committee and your graduate staff adviser your options regarding your defense, especially in regards to how Zoom will or will not be utilized for the committee deliberation portion and room scheduling policies. Students should check and follow the ASU campus guidelines regarding the coronavirus whenever on campus found at this <a href="https://www.asu.edu/about/fall-2020">link</a>.</p>

<div class="panel">
<p>Zoom has taken steps to mitigate this issue in the <a href="https://uto.asu.edu/zoom-privacy">Zoom 5.0 update</a>. Please ensure you are logged on to Zoom via your ASU Enterprise Zoom account. If you are logged on via a personal account, you are not getting the benefits of ASU Enterprise Zoom security. </p>
<p>To protect classes and meetings from unwanted disruptions, now only the host of a given Zoom session can share their screen by default. Learn how to pass the screen-sharing permission to one, several or all Zoom session participants by viewing our <a href="https://asu.service-now.com/kb_view.do?sysparm_article=KB0019479">knowledge base article</a>.</p>

<div class="panel">
<ol><li>Go to <a href="http://asu.zoom.us/">http://asu.zoom.us/</a></li>
<li>Click on “log in” and sign in with your ASURITE. (If you get a pop-up box after that, click accept.)</li>
<li>You should now be on a Zoom page with your name, department and other info. On the upper right, click on “Schedule a meeting.”</li>
<li>Fill in the fields as needed. Pro tip: Clicking “both” under audio adds call-in information for those whose computer audio isn’t working. Hit “Save” at the bottom.</li>
<li>On the next screen, click on “Copy meeting invitation” (on the right, midway down the page) and then copy that info over into an Outlook meeting invite. (There are other ways to do this, but this is often the simplest way.)</li>
<li>At your meeting time, just click on the Zoom link in your own Outlook meeting invitation.</li>

<p>Contact your supervisor immediately if you test positive for COVID-19.

<div class="panel">
<p>Please contact Liz Badalamenti, RN from Employee Wellness, at <a href="mailto:elizabeth.badalamenti@asu.edu">elizabeth.badalamenti@asu.edu</a> as soon as possible.  She will work with you to gather information about the employee, including information about when they were last on campus and with whom they may have been in close contact. She will also coordinate the process of tracing and notifying any close contacts who need to be aware of their illness.</p>
<p>Please refer to <strong>ASU’s Families First Coronavirus Response Act time reporting process guide</strong> on the Office of Human Resources <a href="https://cfo.asu.edu/leaves-management">Leaves Management webpage</a> for guidance on how to report time if the employee is unable to work. Any reporting under these FFCRA guidelines will not impact sick leave or vacation leave balances. If employees can work remotely while recovering, they may do so.</p>
<p>Badalamenti also will work with Facilities Management to coordinate the appropriate level of cleaning in the workplace.</p>
<p>Do not share information about the employee’s health with others or keep records regarding the illness in personnel files. That information is confidential by law, and any written records must be stored separately from personnel files.  Employee Wellness will coordinate the process of tracing those who may have been in close contact with the individual and providing them with notice, in cooperation with county health.  By law, this notice must be accomplished without identifying the ill individual.</p>

<div class="panel">
<p>Individuals who have been in close contact with those who have COVID-19 are at increased risk of developing COVID-19 and should remain in self-isolation and self-monitor for symptoms for at least 14 days from the date on which they had close contact with the ill individual. They should also follow up with their private health care provider, who can make a recommendation as to whether a test may be appropriate. </p>
<p>If they can work remotely, they should continue to do so. If they need time to care for themselves or a family member who has COVID-19, they should report time not worked using <strong>ASU’s Families First Coronavirus Response Act time reporting process guide</strong> on the Office of Human Resources <a href="https://cfo.asu.edu/leaves-management">Leaves Management webpage</a>.
