We have instructed students returning from any country with a Level 3 CDC travel advisory to stay home and not come to campus until they have completed 14-days of self-observation, and practice social-distancing, per the recommendations from the Tarrant County Health Department, Texas Department of State Health Services and CDC.

Please note that information and risk assessment guidance changes frequently; countries that may not pose a risk today may become a country of concern within days. TCU will adhere to the guidance of Tarrant County Public Health and require anyone who has traveled to a country considered Level 3 Widespread Sustained Transmission by the CDC to stay home and not return to campus until they have completed 14-days of self-observation and are symptom-free. Self-observation includes remaining alert to symptoms including fever, cough or difficulty breathing. It also requires that you practice social distancing by avoiding places and events where others congregate, public transportation and ride sharing, and by maintaining distance (approximately 6 feet or 2 meters) from others for 14 days. Students needing more information may contact Campus Life at 817-257-7926.

			        "name": "What is “self-observation?” What is \"social distancing?\" What do all these CDC terms mean?",
			        "acceptedAnswer": {
						"@type": "Answer",
						"text": "The CDC has introduced a number of terms we should be familiar with. Here are the most current definitions: Self-observation Be alert for fever (subjective or measured), cough and difficulty breathing. If you notice any of these symptoms: take your temperature, isolate yourself, limit exposure to others, and call your healthcare provider or your local health department to determine if medical evaluation is needed. Self-monitoring Take your temperature twice a day while staying alert for cough and difficulty breathing. If you develop any of these symptoms, isolate yourself, limit exposure to others, and call your healthcare provider or your local health department to determine if medical evaluation is needed. Self-monitoring with delegated supervision Certain occupational groups (like lab workers or airline crews) may conduct self-monitoring with oversight by an appropriate occupational health or infection control program in coordination with the health department of jurisdiction. Self-monitoring with public health supervision When public health authorities assume the responsibility for oversight of self-monitoring for certain groups of people. Active monitoring State or local health authorities establish regular communication with potentially exposed people to assess fever, cough, or difficulty breathing. For high-risk exposures, CDC recommends daily communication. The state or local public health authority determines the mode of communication, which may include phone calls or electronic communication. Close contact a) Being within approximately 6 feet of a COVID-19 case for a prolonged period of time. Close contact can happen while caring for, living with, visiting, or being in a room with a COVID-19 case. b) Having direct contact with infectious secretions of a COVID-19 case (e.g., being coughed on). Public health order A legally enforceable directive issued under the authority of federal, state, or local entities in order to protect public health. Restrictions (such as movement restrictions) may be made on a person or group’s activities. People or groups may be required to be monitored by a public health agency. Federal, state, or local public health orders may be issued to enforce isolation, quarantine or conditional release. A list of quarantinable communicable diseases for which federal public health orders are authorized is defined by Executive Order. COVID-19 meets the definition for “severe acute respiratory syndromes” as set forth in Executive Order 13295, as amended by Executive Order 13375 and 13674, and, therefore, is a federally quarantinable communicable disease. Isolation Separating a person or group known or reasonably believed to be potentially infectious from those who are not infected to prevent spread of the communicable disease. Isolation for public health purposes may be voluntary or compelled by federal, state, or local public health order. Quarantine The separation of a person or group of people reasonably believed to have been exposed to a communicable disease but not yet symptomatic, from others who have not been so exposed, to prevent the possible spread of the communicable disease. Conditional release Legally enforceable conditions under which a person may be released from more stringent public health movement restrictions, such as quarantine in a secure facility. These conditions may include public health supervision through in-person visits by a health official or designee, telephone, or any electronic or internet-based means of communication as determined by the CDC Director or state or local health authority. A conditional release order may also place limits on travel or require restriction of a person’s movement outside their home. Controlled travel Exclusion from long-distance commercial conveyances (e.g., aircraft, ship, train, bus). For people subject to active monitoring, any long-distance travel should be coordinated with public health authorities to ensure uninterrupted monitoring. Air travel is not allowed by commercial flight but may occur via approved noncommercial air transport. CDC may use public health orders or federal public health travel restrictions to enforce controlled travel. CDC also has the authority to issue travel permits to define the conditions of interstate travel within the United States for people under certain public health orders or if other conditions are met. Congregate settings Crowded public places where close contact with others may occur such as concerts, movie theaters or stadiums. Social distancing Avoiding congregate settings and maintaining a distance of approximately 6 feet from others when possible."

                        <p>The CDC has introduced a number of terms we should be familiar with. Here are the
                           most current definitions:
                        </p>
                        
                        <p><strong>Self-observation</strong> Be alert for fever (subjective or measured), cough and difficulty breathing. If you
                           notice any of these symptoms: take your temperature, isolate yourself, limit exposure
                           to others, and call your healthcare provider or your local health department to determine
                           if medical evaluation is needed.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p><strong>Self-monitoring</strong> Take your temperature twice a day while staying alert for cough and difficulty breathing.
                           If you develop any of these symptoms, isolate yourself, limit exposure to others,
                           and call your healthcare provider or your local health department to determine if
                           medical evaluation is needed.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p><strong>Self-monitoring</strong> <strong>with delegated supervision</strong> Certain occupational groups (like lab workers or airline crews) may conduct self-monitoring
                           with oversight by an appropriate occupational health or infection control program
                           in coordination with the health department of jurisdiction.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p><strong>Self-monitoring</strong> <strong>with public health supervision</strong> When public health authorities assume the responsibility for oversight of self-monitoring
                           for certain groups of people.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p><strong>Active monitoring</strong> State or local health authorities establish regular communication with potentially
                           exposed people to assess fever, cough, or difficulty breathing. For high-risk exposures,
                           CDC recommends daily communication. The state or local public health authority determines
                           the mode of communication, which may include phone calls or electronic communication.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p><strong>Close contact </strong>a) Being within approximately 6 feet of a COVID-19 case for a prolonged period of
                           time. Close contact can happen while caring for, living with, visiting, or being in
                           a room with a COVID-19 case. b) Having direct contact with infectious secretions of
                           a COVID-19 case (e.g., being coughed on).
                        </p>
                        
                        <p><strong>Public health order</strong> A legally enforceable directive issued under the authority of federal, state, or
                           local entities in order to protect public health. Restrictions (such as movement restrictions)
                           may be made on a person or group’s activities. People or groups may be required to
                           be monitored by a public health agency. Federal, state, or local public health orders
                           may be issued to enforce isolation, quarantine or conditional release. A list of <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/quarantine/aboutlawsregulationsquarantineisolation.html">quarantinable communicable diseases</a> for which federal public health orders are authorized is defined by Executive Order.
                           COVID-19 meets the definition for “severe acute respiratory syndromes” as set forth
                           in Executive Order 13295, as amended by Executive Order 13375 and 13674, and, therefore,
                           is a federally quarantinable communicable disease.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p><strong>Isolation</strong> Separating a person or group known or reasonably believed to be potentially infectious
                           from those who are not infected to prevent spread of the communicable disease. Isolation
                           for public health purposes may be voluntary or compelled by federal, state, or local
                           public health order.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p><strong>Quarantine</strong> The separation of a person or group of people reasonably believed to have been exposed
                           to a communicable disease but not yet symptomatic, from others who have not been so
                           exposed, to prevent the possible spread of the communicable disease.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p><strong>Conditional release</strong> Legally enforceable conditions under which a person may be released from more stringent
                           public health movement restrictions, such as quarantine in a secure facility. These
                           conditions may include public health supervision through in-person visits by a health
                           official or designee, telephone, or any electronic or internet-based means of communication
                           as determined by the CDC Director or state or local health authority. A conditional
                           release order may also place limits on travel or require restriction of a person’s
                           movement outside their home.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p><strong>Controlled travel</strong> Exclusion from long-distance commercial conveyances (e.g., aircraft, ship, train,
                           bus). For people subject to active monitoring, any long-distance travel should be
                           coordinated with public health authorities to ensure uninterrupted monitoring. Air
                           travel is not allowed by commercial flight but may occur via approved noncommercial
                           air transport. CDC may use public health orders or <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/quarantine/travel-restrictions.html">federal public health travel restrictions</a> to enforce controlled travel. CDC also has the authority to issue travel permits
                           to define the conditions of interstate travel within the United States for people
                           under certain public health orders or if other conditions are met.
