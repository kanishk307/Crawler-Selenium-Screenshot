                        <p>Tarrant County announced today a countywide&nbsp;<a href="https://www.tarrantcounty.com/content/dam/main/global/Covid-19/TarrantCountyJudgeExecutiveOrder6-25-20.pdf">Executive Order</a>&nbsp;requiring face coverings. The order is effective 6 p.m. Friday, June 26, through
                           6 a.m. Monday, Aug. 3. Effective immediately, face coverings are required on campus,
                           unless you are alone in your private office.&nbsp; Required face coverings on the TCU campus
                           will be in effect beyond August 3 and until further notice. Face coverings for students
                           and instructors inside classrooms will be required throughout the fall semester.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>Due to the spike of coronavirus cases in Tarrant County, TCU will postpone Phase 3
                           of the Return to Campus for Employees plan. We anticipate that our new target date
                           for Phase 3 will be July 13. We will continue to follow guidance from state and local
                           officials and recommendations from the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/colleges-universities/considerations.html">CDC</a>, and will be prepared to adjust our operations accordingly. It is critical that we
                           all do our part to stop the spread of COVID-19. We will continue to share information
                           through&nbsp;this COVID-19 microsite.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>As part of our safe return to campus plan, <a href="/news/2020/family-weekend-and-homecoming-activities-will-not-be-hosted-this-fall.php">we will not host Family Weekend or Homecoming activities this&nbsp;fall</a>. This is a proactive move to reduce travel to the campus and&nbsp;limit large indoor&nbsp;gatherings
                           in an effort to decrease&nbsp;risk to campus. Events will be largely limited to mission
                           critical activities. Additional campus events guidance will be issued in the coming
                           days.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>Please continue to take care of yourselves and your loved ones. Wear a face covering,
                           practice physical distancing outside of your home, wash your hands, and please stay
                           home if you are sick.&nbsp;<a href="/news/2020/free-voluntary-covid-19-testing-offered-for-tcu-students-and-employees-june-22-26.php">COVID-19 testing</a>&nbsp;is available on-campus through 5 p.m. Friday, June 26, and walk-ins are now accepted.

                        <p><span>Testing sites are offered in cities and to various organizations to help benchmark
                              coronavirus cases in the community and help stop the spread of the COVID-19. The site
                              is a Texas National Guard mobile coronavirus testing site, managed by the Texas Division

                           Once registered online, participants will receive a call back from testing administrators

                        <p><strong>University announces revised academic calendar for fall, introduces TCU Connected
                              Campus initiative</strong></p>
                        
                        <p>Texas Christian University Chancellor Victor J. Boschini, Jr. announced changes today
                           to the university’s fall 2020 semester calendar to help protect the health and safety
                           of the campus community. The semester will begin Aug. 17, a week earlier than originally
                           planned, and end the on-campus portion of the semester Nov. 24. The final deadline
                           for grade submissions, graduate student defenses and other project work will be Dec.
                           10.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>“As an organization that employs and cares for so many, we must plan responsibly,
                           deliberate with transparency, and make the best decisions for our future,” Chancellor
                           Boschini said. “Our goal in altering the fall 2020 calendar is to reduce non-essential
                           travel over the holidays and minimize time on campus during peak flu and cold season.
                           This also allows students to return home before Thanksgiving and enjoy an extended
                           winter break with their families.”
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>The change is one of several proactive actions TCU is making to respond to the global
                           pandemic while preparing to welcome students back to campus Aug. 17. Further information
                           regarding health and safety measures for students, faculty and staff will be announced
                           later in June, which includes plans for physical distancing, use of larger classrooms
                           and outdoor spaces, enhanced cleaning protocols and residence hall capacity.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>“In the final analysis each member of the TCU community is first and foremost personally
                           responsible for their health and well-being,” Chancellor Boschini said.&nbsp;“As such they
                           should always use good judgment in any and every activity they undertake.&nbsp;This is
                           a personal responsibility which is assumed of everyone in this community.”
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>The university welcomed <a href="/news/2020/tcu-shares-initial-return-to-campus-guidance-for-employees.php">Phase 1 employees back to campus May 26</a>, as part of the Return to Campus plan. In it, the university outlines initial personal
                           health and safety expectations for employees with an emphasis on personal responsibility
                           and using good judgment, as well as enhanced cleaning protocols and physical distancing
                           for workplace scenarios.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>“We are creating a new way forward, and absolutely cannot wait to have our students
                           on campus in August,” Chancellor Boschini said.<span>&nbsp; </span>“As I have said before, they are the heartbeat of TCU, and we are ready to welcome
                           them to their home away from home.”&nbsp;

                        <p>The university introduced today the “<a href="/connected-campus/index.php">TCU Connected Campus</a>” – an initiative to address safety and prepare for and reimagine what the approaching
                           school year may look like for the Horned Frog family as the global pandemic evolves.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>The microsite outlines the university’s commitment to the student experience and is
                           based on four key pillars: Academic Excellence, with added agility; Student Support,
                           to meet the physical, spiritual and mental health needs of our students; Student Experience,
                           helping students forge connective bonds that nurture them on and off campus; and Campus
                           Readiness, which will guide TCU through a safe return and on-campus instruction.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>The key to the Connected Campus is the personalized attention for which TCU is known.
                           This takes place in the classroom led by high-quality expert faculty and in the myriad
                           programs and activities led by Student Affairs. TCU is committed to supporting its
                           students, both virtually and on campus.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>Further, the initiative ensures that TCU will deliver the same high-quality instruction
                           both in person and online. Learn more about <a href="/connected-campus/index.php">TCU Connected Campus</a>.

                        <p>TCU has shared <a href="/coronavirus/files/Phase-1-Return-to-Campus.pdf">Phase I</a>&nbsp;initial guidance for employees returning to campus beginning May 26. The initial
                           information has been prepared under the careful guidance of the Chancellor’s Fall
                           2020 Campus Readiness Task Force. Communication regarding employee return expectations
                           and timing will come through supervisors.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>TCU will continue to adhere to public health authorities and guidelines from the <span><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-nCoV/index.html">Centers for Disease Control</a>&nbsp;</span>as the plan progresses.

                        <p>A limited number of leaders and department heads will return in Phase 1 to prepare
                           the campus for succeeding phases and ultimately the return of students in August.
                           All members of the TCU community should wear face coverings when in public (each employee
                           will receive one machine washable cloth face covering).
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>Gatherings will be limited to avoid community spread. Employees are encouraged to
                           continue using Zoom for meetings with colleagues and others. If in-person meetings
                           are required, physical distancing guidelines should be followed.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p><span><a href="/coronavirus/files/Daily-Health-Self-Assessment-On-Site-Personnel.pdf">Daily health assessments</a>&nbsp;</span>should be conducted to ensure the health and safety of your family and the TCU campus.

                        <p>Texas Christian University Chancellor Victor J. Boschini, Jr. announced to students,
                           parents, faculty and staff today that the university intends for students to safely
                           return to campus for the fall 2020 semester, with a planned start date of Aug. 24.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>Chancellor Boschini stated that TCU will continue to abide by government and public
                           health guidance and that under his direction, the Fall 2020 Campus Readiness Task
                           Force will oversee the safe return of residential life and on-campus instruction.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>“The health and safety of our students, faculty and staff is our responsibility and
                           our highest priority,” Chancellor Boschini said.&nbsp;“As an institution of higher learning,
                           we also must preserve our academic environment, the intellectual advancement of our
                           students, and safely provide all that the TCU experience promises.”<br><br>The Chancellor’s task force is organizing and directing formal processes and policies
                           for reopening campus across key areas, including academic affairs, student affairs,
                           campus life, campus operations, health and safety, workplace, athletics and finance.
                           Based on the guidance of the task force and public health authorities, TCU will phase
                           faculty and staff back to campus, while continuing online classes for the summer.
                           <br><br>Further, Chancellor Boschini said that rigorous academic planning is being led by
                           Provost Teresa Abi-Nader Dahlberg to position TCU for flexibility while honoring the
                           personal needs of our students and strengthening TCU’s connected campus culture.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>“COVID-19 has caused significant disruption to all of our lives, and temporarily required
                           us to change some of the ways we interact,” Boschini said. “This pandemic has reinforced
                           our strong belief that preparation is key, and the TCU experience must be preserved,
                           regardless of how it’s delivered.”
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>The university has also expressed its dedication to working with students and families
                           who require additional financial support due to financial uncertainties caused by
                           COVID-19. TCU is allocating additional institutionally funded aid to immediately assist
                           with summer school costs and plans are being developed to provide additional financial
                           assistance for the fall semester, with more information coming in the weeks ahead.
                        </p>

                        <p>A&nbsp;second construction&nbsp;worker&nbsp;at the TCU Music Center has tested&nbsp;positive&nbsp;for COVID-19.&nbsp;The
                           individual was in a work team and had direct contact with the individual who tested
                           positive for COVID-19 on April 17. The building is new&nbsp;construction&nbsp;and is not open
                           to faculty, staff or students.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>This individual was last at the work site April 16. The area was cleared of personnel
                           and sanitized at that time and construction at the building is paused until May 1
                           (14 days from the time the individuals were last at the work site).
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>The general risk to the TCU community from this case is considered low, given that
                           the&nbsp;construction&nbsp;site is a new building and closed to anyone other than&nbsp;construction&nbsp;personnel.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>This is the second positive COVID-19 case reported on the TCU campus at this time.
                           The previous two positive cases with direct on-campus contact&nbsp;have recovered.

                        <p>With COVID-19 community transmission continuing in the United States and globally,
                           TCU has now suspended all University-sponsored domestic and international&nbsp;travel&nbsp;until
                           August 1, 2020&nbsp;or until further notice.&nbsp; Exceptions to this&nbsp;travel&nbsp;suspension must
                           be approved by the appropriate Vice Chancellor via email. In the event that international
                           travel is approved by a Vice Chancellor, it must be registered using the <a href="https://studyabroad.tcu.edu/faculty-staff-resources/international-travel-registry/">TCU Faculty &amp; Staff Authorizations &amp; Registration</a> system. The University requests that non-essential personal&nbsp;travel&nbsp;to domestic and
                           international regions with community transmission be reconsidered.

                        <p><strong>Construction contractor at TCU Music Center tests&nbsp;positive&nbsp;for COVID-19&nbsp;</strong></p>
                        
                        <p>A construction worker at the TCU Music Center has tested&nbsp;positive&nbsp;for COVID-19. The
                           building is new construction and is not open to any faculty, staff or students.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>The construction worker was last at the work site April 16. The area has been cleared
                           of personnel and sanitized. Out of an abundance of caution, construction will be paused
                           for 14 days. There are no other reported COVID-19 cases within the contractor’s site
                           work team.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>The general risk to the TCU community from this case is considered low, given that
                           the construction site is a new building and closed to anyone other than construction
                           personnel.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>This is the only positive COVID-19 case reported on the TCU campus at this time. The
                           previous two positive cases with direct on-campus contact&nbsp;have recovered.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>COVID-19 updates for the TCU campus will continue to be posted in the Staying Informed

                        <p>Dear Horned Frogs:</p>
                        
                        <p>The end of the spring semester is in sight, and I want to thank all of you for your
                           patience and dedication to your academic goals. Together, we are keeping our campus
                           community safe and quickly adapting to the challenges of a virtual educational environment.&nbsp;&nbsp;
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>We’re now transitioning to the summer term, and are faced with the same uncertainties
                           as the COVID-19 pandemic continues to threaten the health and well-being of our communities.&nbsp;
                           <strong><em>Consequently, the University has decided to continue in an online learning environment
                                 for almost all courses offered from May through August of 2020.</em></strong></p>
                        
                        <p>I’m happy to say that this will be a new and improved remote learning environment.&nbsp;
                           I know that for some, the transition has not always been smooth, given the quick pivot
                           required. We did our best to get through this transition, and I’m proud of all of
                           you. We have now had time to apply our learnings in preparation for a robust summer
                           term.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p><strong><em>Please note that registration appointments for summer and fall will begin on April
                                 20, 2020.</em></strong> Additional information will be coming as we get closer to the beginning of the term,
                           but I want to share some key points with you in order to assist with your planning
                           as soon as possible.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>This summer, you will encounter two types of online course offerings.&nbsp; The difference
                           is primarily in how class participation is structured:
                        </p>
                        
                        <ol>
                           
                           <li><strong>FULLY ONLINE:</strong> Some existing courses are still available in a fully-online format. We describe these
                              courses as being “asynchronous,” meaning students work independently of each other.
                              You can identify those by their section numbers of 400 to 499.
                           </li>
                           
                           <li><strong>HYBRID ONLINE:</strong> All other courses will be “Hybrid Online Courses,” TCU’s new educational format for
                              summer.&nbsp; In this type of course, students will:
                              
                              <ul>
                                 
                                 <li>attend required&nbsp;<u>synchronous</u>&nbsp;sessions, meaning you will have scheduled meetings as a class.
                                 </li>
                                 
                                 <li>engage with other students in content-focused learning activities.</li>
                                 
                                 <li>submit work or create a learning artifact at least every seven days during the course
                                    session.
                                 </li>
                                 
                                 <li>have faculty who have been trained and certified to teach in the Hybrid Online format.</li>
                                 
                              </ul>
                              
                           </li>
                           
                        </ol>
                        
                        <p>Although we don’t have every detail to share with you yet, we are in the process of
                           reviewing and confirming current course offerings, and also exploring the possibility
                           of adding courses to help keep you on-track with your degree plan.&nbsp; Consequently,
                           we encourage you to continue monitoring your anticipated schedule using TCU’s “Class
                           Search” tool at <a href="https://classes.tcu.edu/">https://classes.tcu.edu/</a> and to reach out to your advisors closer to April 20<sup>th</sup>.

                        <p>We can’t wait to gather again on-campus as a TCU community! Until that is possible,
                           you can expect an online learning environment that is engaging, challenging, and reflects
                           the high academic standards of a Texas Christian University education. Our faculty
                           and staff are making every effort to keep you safe, and on path to graduation.

                        <p>Chancellor Boschini and I have heard from many of you over the past few weeks, and
                           I want to personally thank you for your wit, your resilience and for your grace as
                           we navigate these unusual times in the life of our University.

                        <p><span style="font-style: inherit !important; font-weight: inherit !important;">TCU learned late in the day on April 1 that a student living in a TCU apartment has
                              tested positive for COVID-19. The student has been in self-quarantine while awaiting
                              test results for COVID-19, which were submitted March 19. The student is doing well,
                              has been symptom-free for seven days and is beyond the 14-day, self-quarantine period.
                              </span></p>
                        
                        <p>TCU will notify social and residential groups with whom this student has interacted
                           in the last two to three weeks, to the extent possible. Although notification of the
                           case has occurred outside of the 14 days of required quarantine, out of an abundance
                           of caution and in keeping with TCU policy, the student’s apartment and common areas
                           will be thoroughly cleaned and sanitized under public health guidance.
                        </p>

                        <p>Per public health guidance, TCU will announce only positive, confirmed COVID-19 test
                           results.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>On April 1, TCU sent a mass notification to all students, faculty and staff of the
                           first COVID-19 case reported on the TCU campus. Moving forward, additional confirmed
                           cases will be posted on this microsite (tcu.edu/coronavirus) under the tab, “<a href="/coronavirus/campus-communications.php">Staying Informed</a>.” Additionally, information will be shared with social and residential groups who
                           have interacted with the COVID-19 positive individual(s) over the prior two to three
                           weeks, to the extent possible.

                        <p><strong>TCU announces standardized tests are now optional for Fall 2021 applicants</strong></p>
                        
                        <p>Texas Christian University has announced that it is suspending the requirement of
                           standardized tests for students who are currently high school juniors. For students
                           expected to enter college in Fall 2021, the suspension of SAT and ACT testing due
                           to COVID-19 has created additional complications, and the university is making accommodations
                           to address these challenges.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>“We understand the uncertainties high school juniors are currently facing,” Heath
                           Einstein, TCU’s dean of admission, said. “Campus visits are now virtual, the ACT and
                           SAT testing dates are shifting and it has heightened the already high stress these
                           students are facing. TCU wants to do what we can to reduce some of the anxiety, so
                           that students may focus on their safety and successfully shift to a new educational
                           modality.”
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>With the policy shift, prospective students may decide for themselves whether they
                           wish to include standardized test scores with their application. Students should consider
                           their academic record in addition to their co-curricular experiences when making their
                           decision on whether to include test scores. Other factors considered in the admission
                           process are curriculum rigor, essays, and contributions to school and community.&nbsp;
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>“TCU has never relied solely on one factor in admission decisions, and that will be
                           reinforced while we are suspending the testing requirement,” Einstein said. “We have
                           always believed that while standardized tests provide some useful information, there
                           is more to a student’s record that indicates how they would contribute in and out
                           of the classroom at TCU. The qualities that matter most to us – personal character
                           and the ability to meaningfully engage with the community – can’t be found by looking
                           at a test score.”
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>TCU will continue its policy to allow applicants to self-report test scores through
                           the online admission portal. For any of these students who enroll, the university
                           requires official results from the test agency.

                        <p><strong>Construction contractor at Amon G. Carter Stadium tests&nbsp;positive&nbsp;for COVID-19&nbsp;</strong></p>
                        
                        <p>Texas Christian University has learned that a Turner Construction employee working
                           at Amon G. Carter Stadium has tested&nbsp;positive&nbsp;for COVID-19. The individual is currently
                           doing well, receiving care and recovering at home.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>The contractor was last at the work site March 24 and worked primarily outside. The
                           area was cleared of personnel and sanitized per public health guidance. The construction
                           work group was following social distancing protocols and the two team members that
                           were in closest contact with the COVID-19 positive individual are currently in a 14-day
                           quarantine and self-monitoring period. Neither are currently showing symptoms.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>“Our thoughts are with the contractor and their family, and all those affected by
                           COVID-19,” Jane Torgerson, M.D., medical director for Brown-Lupton Health Center,
                           said in an email to campus. “The general risk to the TCU community from this case
                           is considered low, given the limited exposure the individual had on campus and the
                           work team’s adherence to CDC guidelines.”
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>This is the first report of a positive COVID-19 case on the TCU campus. COVID-19 updates
                           for the TCU campus will continue to be posted&nbsp;on this site.

                           made due to the rapid spread and unpredictability of the disease. Faculty will use
                           the week of March 16 in order to prepare for a full online format.<br> <br>“TCU’s highest priority is the health and well-being of our community and these measures

                           Jr. said. “We have a responsibility to each other, our campus and the greater community
                           to help ensure good health, decrease the potential impacts of COVID-19, and to prevent
                           its exposure to vulnerable populations.”<br> <br>Students who have been away from campus for Spring Break are asked to hold on returning
                           to campus until they receive further instruction. <br> <br>All large meetings, conferences and on-campus events are canceled through April 3.
                           TCU business operations will remain open the week of March 16, as well as March 23
                           - April 3.
