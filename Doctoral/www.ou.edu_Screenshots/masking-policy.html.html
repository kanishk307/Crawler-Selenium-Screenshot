Masks must be worn by all passengers in University-provided transportation, such as campus shuttles, buses, police safety escorts, and motor pool/leased vehicles. Drivers must wear a mask when passengers are in the vehicle. Individuals may remove masks only if they are in their own enclosed private workspace with no one else present or in their dorm room, as more fully described below.</p>
