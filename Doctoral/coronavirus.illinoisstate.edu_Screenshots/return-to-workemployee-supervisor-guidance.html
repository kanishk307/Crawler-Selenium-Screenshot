		                <h1>Employee and Supervisor Guidance for Managing COVID-19 in the Workplace</h1>
                  <p class="c-lede__copy">This guidance has been developed to help employees and supervisors follow proper protocol for a variety of scenarios in the workplace regarding COVID-19. This document is not intended to capture every possible scenario but, rather, is a reflection of the most common scenarios that may be presented. This document will be updated with additional information and guidance as it comes available and as the University moves from summer into fall and the State moves through the phases of the Governor's Restore Illinois plan. Questions, comments or concerns about the information presented should be submitted to <a href="mailto:covid19_hrquestions@ilstu.edu">covid19_hrquestions@ilstu.edu</a>.</p>
                  <p>Individuals who seek COVID-19 testing and treatment are often being told to relay information directly to his or her supervisor. In order to protect an employee's personal health information and ensure all necessary procedures are carried out, Human Resources requests that employees provide information directly to the Benefit Counselors in Human Resources. Supervisors will be notified as appropriate.</p>
                  <p>Individuals who need to inform Human Resources of COVID-19 related information outside of normal business hours (Monday–Friday, 7:30 a.m.–4:30 p.m.) should call (309) 438-5507. Please leave a message with relevant details for your call and contact information. A member of the Human Resources team will be in contact with you as soon as possible.</p>
                  <p>Employees who feel ill, whether related to COVID-19 or an unrelated illness, should stay home and seek medical attention if appropriate. Keep in mind that employees requesting time away from work should follow normal call-in procedures and protocols for their department and report time away from work in accordance with University policy.</p>

                  <p>The identification of close contacts is typically done by the local health department by individuals trained in the criteria and factors that are needed to determine if someone is a close contact. The University does not notify employees or determine close contacts. If you have not been contacted, you are not a close contact. This process does not begin until the local health department receives a confirmed positive result.</p>
                  <p>If an individual believes that he or she has may have been exposed to someone who is symptomatic or to someone who has tested positive but has not been deemed a close contact, please follow the guidance for Scenario 2.</p>
                  <p>If an individual has been deemed a close contact of a positive individual, please follow the guidance for Scenario 3.</p>
                  <h2>Directing Employees to Test</h2>
                  <p>Supervisors should be aware that they should not direct an employee to seek or not seek testing for COVID-19. The decision to test should be made between the employee and his or her health care provider.</p>
