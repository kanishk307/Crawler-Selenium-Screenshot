This recommendation is an effort to slow the spread of the virus and help people who may have the virus and do not know it from transmitting it to others. Cloth face coverings fashioned from household items or made at home from common materials at low cost can be used as an additional, voluntary public health measure.</p>
                           <p>The cloth face coverings recommended are not surgical masks or N-95 respirators. Those are critical supplies that must continue to be reserved for healthcare workers and other medical first responders, as recommended by current CDC guidance.</p>

                           <p>Illinois State University has taken extraordinary steps to limit the number of individuals on campus. Individuals should only be on campus if their position has been deemed onsite essential. The cleaning enhancements currently include:</p>
                           <ul>
                              <li>Sanitizing and disinfecting high touch surface areas, such as wiping off desktops and workstations, cleaning flat surfaces in offices, including keyboards, doorknobs, elevators buttons, handrails, counter tops at all front desks, light switches, entry glass, and door push plates. The frequency of cleaning, sanitizing and disinfecting these surfaces was increased to at least daily. Restrooms and public spaces are still being cleaned and disinfected at least daily, often more.</li>
                              <li>Disinfectants that we are utilizing on campus are on the EPA-approved list of cleaners</li>
                              <li>Social distancing is being explained and encouraged for our teams working on campus</li>
                           </ul>
                           <p>If the University learns of a presumptive positive or positive case and determines that the individual was within the workspace during the period of time in which they were contagious, the University will follow all CDC guidelines on cleaning, sanitizing and, if appropriate, limiting access to the area. Any communications with staff will be handled in accordance with directions from the Illinois Department of Public Health or the McLean County Health Department.</p>

                           <p>The University follows CDC and OSHA (Occupational Safety and Health Administration) guidance at all times and particularly during the current pandemic for all U.S. workers and employers as it pertains to the use of personal protective equipment (PPE). The University provides PPE to all employees as required based upon the work that they are performing in the position to which they are assigned.</p>
                           <p>Given this new language, beginning Friday, May 1st, all onsite essential faculty, staff and student employees should be wearing face coverings at all times while on university property when maintaining a six-foot social distance is not possible. Face coverings will be required at all times in university dining facilities and retail establishments. Individually owned face coverings may be worn. For employees with uniforms, dress codes or other employment-specific requirements, face coverings should be plain, without text or pictures, except for ISU branded materials, or patterned (e.g. chevron, paisley, checkered, etc.), provided the pattern itself is not comprised of images or pictures other than those specifically permitted. The coverings must be kept in a clean condition, may not be contrary to other requirements of the work assignment and cannot pose a safety hazard.</p>
                           <p>Currently, the University has a limited supply of face coverings but is working to obtain a number sufficient to provide all faculty, staff and students one reusable cloth face covering. If an onsite essential faculty member, staff member or student employee does not possess a personal face covering that they wish to wear and that is consistent, as applicable, with the University standard outlined above, they should work with their supervisor to obtain a University-provided face covering.</p>
                           <p>All employees should remember that, regardless of the work performed or the area of work, it is always a good practice to:</p>
                           <ul>
                              <li>Frequently wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. When soap and running water are unavailable, use an alcohol-based hand rub with at least 60% alcohol. Always wash hands that are visibly soiled.</li>
                              <li>Avoid touching your eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands.</li>
                              <li>Avoid close contact with people who are sick.</li>
                              <li>Practice social distancing of 6 feet per person to the greatest extent possible.</li>
                           </ul>
                           <p>Employees who believe they have a disability and would like to request a reasonable accommodation should contact the Office of Equal Opportunity and Access (OEOA) at (309) 438-3383 or by email at EqualOpportunity@IllinoisState.edu to discuss your eligibility for an accommodation under the Americans with Disabilities Act.</p>

                           <p>The University has taken several steps to limit the risk of exposure to our faculty, staff and students. Onsite essential employees are generally needed to work onsite when assigned to do so. Onsite essential employees who are not sick but who wish to take time off to stay at home are expected to follow existing departmental policy by requesting time off from their supervisor. Approval will be at the supervisor's discretion in order to meet operational needs.</p>
                           <p>Employees who feel they qualify for an applicable leave during this time, should contact Human Resources at (309) 438-8311 and request to speak to their Benefits Counselor.</p>

We realize final payments are due on April 10 and will make every effort to apply adjustments prior to that date, if possible. Please check your student account closer to that date and prior to making a payment. You will see a reduction on your student account via My.IllinoisState.edu regardless of when you collected your belongings for move out.  If you were approved to stay on campus during the closure, you will not receive a reduction to your account.</p>

For example, if you applied for the Fall 2020 term, you can update your application to Spring 2021 or Summer 2021, and you would not need to reapply. However, you would still need to submit any new documentation for review and evaluation. Contact the Office of Admissions to start this process.</p>

                               <p>For the spring housing and dining credits, you will see a credit for the amount that you were originally charged for and then new charges for the prorated amount that you are now being charged for the semester. Excess Flex dollars for the spring semester will be included in the calculation of the prorated amount of your meal contract. Any excess flex dollars from the fall meal contract will be credited to the student account as a credit called ‘Flex Dollar Credit’ by the end of the spring term. </p>

                           <p>While it is advised you make a payment toward your account, we understand your concern. If a credit is not applied to your account prior to the April 10 due date and you choose not to make a payment, the University will not charge a late fee or place a registration block due to late payments during this period of time.</p>
                           <p>

                              <li>When the spring credits are applied, your payment plan will recalculate with a new amount due for April 10 and May 8. The flex dollar credit amount for your fall rollover flex dollars will be credited toward your May 8 payment amount.</li>
                           </ul>

                              <li>If you cancel by April 7, the University will credit your student account prior to April 24, 2020 for the period of March 15 – May 9. Fall 2019 rollover flex dollars will be credited by the end of the spring term. The credit will be applied directly to your student account. If you have a remaining balance on your student account at the time of the credit, the prorated amount will automatically be applied to that balance. If your credit exceeds your remaining balance, the difference will be refunded to you.</li>
                              <li>If you cancel after April 7, the credit will be applied to your student account at the end of the spring term.</li>
