<div class="row">
<div class="large-9 columns">
<p>Per the University&#8217;s announced plan to reopen in three phases, we are compiling lists of research operations and personnel who will be accessing Clemson space during Phase 2. The University currently has a list of essential research activity being conducted on site each day during Phase 1. If you need to request changes to the Phase 1 list, continue to notify your department chair or associate dean for research.</p>
<p>The Division of Research has collected requests to access Clemson space for research during Phase 2. College requests have been reviewed by the Research Restart Committee and recommendations have been submitted to the University&#8217;s Emergency Operations Center for final approval.</p>
<p>A couple points on Phase 2 research requests:</p>
<ul class="flush">
<li>Researchers should continue to work remotely as much as possible (e.g., writing reports, papers, theses, data analyses, computer simulation, etc.).</li>
<li>Undergraduate students will not be included on these lists for facility access during the summer, apart from the few previously reviewed and approved exceptions.</li>
<li>As a condition of approval for Phase 2, a PI or research group must be registered in <a href="https://www.clemson.edu/research/safety/BioRAFT/"><strong>BioRAFT</strong></a>. BioRAFT is an intuitive online safety platform that will allow you to quickly and easily manage supply inventories, lab personnel, training requirements and inspections. This system will save you time and help the University best promote safety and compliance. <a href="mailto:cweber2@clemson.edu?&amp;cc=jgriege@clemson.edu"><strong>Occupational and Environmental Safety (OES)</strong></a> can assist with BioRAFT registrations, if needed.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Division of Research and office of Occupational and Environmental Safety have put together several guidance documents to provide information during these phases of modified operations:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="../../coronavirus-x/documents/guidance-for-essential-research.pdf#Guidance for Essential Research Activities During Modified Operating Conditions">Guidance for Essential Research Activities During Modified Operating Conditions</a></strong></li>

</ul>
<h2>New Proposals and Grant Management</h2>
<p>Proposal submissions, award acceptance and financial management of grants and contracts continue uninterrupted as Division of Research staff work remotely. Staff is also monitoring federal agency sponsors for impacts on application deadlines, allowability of costs, and guidance on conducting human subjects research. The Council on Governmental Relations (COGR) is hosting a <strong><a href="https://www.cogr.edu/institutional-and-agency-responses-covid-19-and-additional-resources">useful repository of communications </a></strong> to track guidance from federal agencies. <a href="https://www.clemson.edu/research/compliance/contact-us.html">Research Compliance</a> offices are fully operational and are available to assist faculty with human subjects and animal care protocols.</p>
<h2>Industry Engagement</h2>
<p>Both the <strong><a href="http://curf.clemson.edu/">Clemson University Research Foundation</a></strong> and the <strong><a href="https://www.clemson.edu/research/industry-contracts/">Office of Industry Contracts</a></strong> remain fully operational. Investigators with industry-sponsored research projects should contact the Office of Industry Contracts if their project is paused or scaled back due to COVID-19 precautions.</p>

<p class="title" data-section-title=""><a href="#panel21a"><strong>If I must work remotely, can I still be paid from a grant?</strong></a></p>
<div class="content" data-slug="panel21a">
<p>Consistent with Clemson&#8217;s charging practices, employees will continue to be paid regardless of funding source, which should continue at its normal allocation.</p>
<p>The Council on Governmental Relations (COGR) is hosting a <strong><a href="https://www.cogr.edu/institutional-and-agency-responses-covid-19-and-additional-resources">useful repository of communications here</a></strong> to track guidance from federal agencies.</p>
<p><strong>Highlights from federal agencies are below: </strong></p>
<p>The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Memorandum M-20-17 released on March 19, 2020 provides the following directions to Federal Awarding agencies: Awarding agencies may allow recipients to continue to charge salaries and benefits to currently active Federal awards consistent with the recipients' policy of paying salaries (under unexpected or extraordinary circumstances) from all funding sources, Federal and non-Federal. Awarding agencies may allow other costs to be charged to Federal awards necessary to resume activities supported by the award, consistent with applicable Federal cost principles and the benefit to the project. Awarding agencies may also evaluate the grantee's ability to resume the project activity in the future and the appropriateness of future funding, as done under normal circumstances based on subsequent progress reports and other communications with the grantee. Awarding agencies must require recipients to maintain appropriate records and cost documentation as required by 2 CFR &#167; 200.302 - Financial management and 2 CFR &#167; 200.333 - Retention requirement of records to substantiate the charging of any salaries and other project activities costs related to interruption of operations or services. Consistent with OMB&#8217;s Memorandum, the National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Science Foundation (NSF) and Department of Defense (DOD) have provided consistent language with the following additions in their specific guidance:</p>
<p><strong>NSF:</strong> Recipients must not assume that supplemental funding will be available should the charging of such costs or other fees result in a shortage of funds to eventually carry out the project. If a shortfall is anticipated, recipients must contact the cognizant NSF Program Officer to discuss the situation. NSF will evaluate the grantee&#8217;s ability to resume the project activity in the future and the appropriateness of future funding, as done under normal circumstances&#8212;based on subsequent project reports and other communications with the recipient.</p>
<p><strong>NIH: Salaries</strong> - NIH understands that many researchers may be unable to work as a result of or related to the effects of COVID-19. If a recipient organization&#8217;s policy allows for the charging of salaries and benefits during periods when no work is performed due to the effect of COVID-19, regardless of the funding source, including Federal and non-Federal, then such charges to NIH grant awards will be allowable. Reminder: NIH awarding Institutes/Centers (ICs) may request documentation to confirm the requirements of institutional policies. <strong>Stipend</strong> - Institutions affected by COVID-19 may continue to provide stipend payments to fellows and trainees who may be unable to work as a result of or related to COVID-19. Recipients should notify the assigned grants management official, and provide documentation demonstrating the effect of COVID-19, and how long the institution will be affected.</p>
<p><strong>DOD:</strong> DOD components may allow other costs to be charged to federal awards necessary to continue work on a project even if in a period where primary research activities are limited or curtailed. To the maximum extent practicable, recipients will be expected to invoke or institute any and all reasonable mitigation actions and practices to lessen the cost to the government during the crisis period. Such actions may be part of an existing program created by the recipient or may be created to respond to this crisis. Appropriate records and cost documentation must continue to be updated and maintained as required by 2 CFR 200.302 - Financial management and 2 CFR 200.333 - Retention requirement of records.</p>

<p class="title" data-section-title=""><a href="#panel16a"><strong>Can I receive a no-cost extension? </strong></a></p>
<div class="content" data-slug="panel16a">Federal agency sponsors typically allow for no-cost extensions. Consult with your grants manager in the <strong><a href="https://www.clemson.edu/research/grants-contracts/contact-us.html">Grants and Contracts Administration</a></strong> office. Additionally, the Council on Governmental Relations (COGR) is hosting a useful repository of communications from <strong><a href="https://www.cogr.edu/institutional-and-agency-responses-covid-19-and-additional-resources">federal agencies</a></strong> as well.</div>

<p class="title" data-section-title=""><a href="#panel18a"><strong>Are travel cancellation costs due to COVID-19 allowable as direct charges to sponsored projects? </strong></a></p>
<div class="content" data-slug="panel18a">Federal agencies are beginning to provide guidance in this area. NIH has issued NIH Notice, NOT-OD-20-086, and updated the Council on Governmental Relations (COGR) FAQs that address the allowability of non-refundable cancellation fees on sponsored awards. The new updated guidance provides information that support travel cancellation costs on Sponsor, fund 20 projects. Due to the special circumstances and travel restrictions resulting from COVID-19, non-refundable travel costs may remain on sponsored awards incurred during the period impacted by COVID-19. However, as noted in the COGR FAQs, refunds or airline credits must be attempted and documented, and any refunds or credit received must be applied back to the sponsored project (i.e. not to the travelers personal or frequent flyer account). The related COGR FAQ&#8217;s are presented below (please continue to check the active COGR link above for the full list of FAQs, as well as updates as they are made available).</div>

<p class="title" data-section-title=""><a href="#panel19a"><strong>How should credits from cancelled travel costs be handled on sponsored projects? </strong></a></p>
<div class="content" data-slug="panel19a">If a traveler has charged (e.g., through prepayment or a travel advance) an airline ticket or other travel cost to a sponsored project, and then that trip is later cancelled, the credit must accrue to the sponsored project (see 2 CFR 200.406). Some airlines are offering full refunds for trips that need to be cancelled due to COVID-19; in these instances, the refund should accrue to the grant, either directly through the institution&#8217;s travel system or via reimbursement from the traveler. If a traveler cancels a trip and accrues a credit on their personal account, the traveler should follow institutional policy for how to track and manage the credit.</div>

<div class="content" data-slug="panel21a">Statement form the NIH: NIH understands the potential effects of COVID-19 on the progress of NIH supported research. Recipients must contact the funding IC to alert them of any effects on the NIH funded research. NIH is committed to working with its applicants and recipients during this public health emergency. In addition, NIH recognizes that there may be delays in submission of RPPRs and other reports.
