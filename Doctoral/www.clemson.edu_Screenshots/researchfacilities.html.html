<p>Our aim is to minimize all activities performed at AARL with the goal of preventing exposure of the AARL staff to COVID-19, which could result in facility closure. Based on advice from Federal and State agencies and Clemson leadership, we will take the following actions immediately.</p>
<ol class="flush">
<li>PI operated cultures will continue to be cared for by PI and designated essential employees.</li>
<li>All research activity should stop unless a case-by-case approval is given by your ADR and additionally approved by Dr. John Parrish and John Smink</li>
<li>We reserve the right to determine who can enter the facility to do animal husbandry and what time of day they can be present.</li>
<li>AARL staff will be on limited duties. In an emergency, please contact John Smink.</li>
<li>No external visitors, including family members of faculty, students and staff.</li>
<li>All new animal orders are suspended until further notice.</li>
<li>Please sanitize your hands upon entry to the AARL. Don a pair of gloves and wash hands frequently with soap and water.</li>

</ol>
<h3>AARL GENERAL GUIDELINES FOR COVID19</h3>
<ol class="flush">
<li>AARL animal care staff are deemed &#8220;essential personnel&#8221; and will be responsible for the normal 7 day a week daily care of the animals as usual. AARL personnel will support PI operated cultures when asked.</li>
<li>No new research may be initiated without ADR assurance that the study is essential and cannot be delayed. Special arrangement must be made with John Smink if research activities will be performed at the AARL.</li>
<li>AARL personnel will be alternated and staffing will be minimized. If you have culture system maintenance issue or assistance is needed and is not an emergency, please schedule a time by using email correspondence with John Smink.</li>
<li>Only one person should be in any room at any one time. Please maintain social distancing. Only work together when necessary but still maintain distance as much as possible.</li>
<li>AARL personnel will disinfect surfaces commonly touched by personnel at least twice daily, including doorknobs/handles, light switches, work surfaces, water quality lab and instrumentation.</li>

<div class="content" data-section-content="" data-slug="panel2a">
<h3>ACCESS</h3>
<p>As of March 18, users will no longer have electronic key access to the facility. As such, upon arrival, approved users or individuals dropping off pre-approved slides/samples must call CLIF personnel in order to obtain access to the facility. <strong>Personal contact information for the on-duty CLIF personnel will be supplied in the appointment/sample approval email, so be sure to take note of this information before arrival at the CLIF or you will not be able to enter the facility</strong>.</p>
<h3>SCHEDULING</h3>
<p>All regular sign-up services will be discontinued. Instead, all users must email facility director Terri Bruce at <strong><a href="mailto:terri@clemson.edu">terri@clemson.edu</a></strong> to receive approval for:</p>
<ol class="flush">
<li>their arrival time and appointment length</li>
<li>room where they will work and</li>
<li>capability they will use.</li>
</ol>
<p>Upon receipt of the initial request, the Principle Investigator will be emailed a link to a Google Document request form. The Principle Investigator will then be required to fill out a Google Document detailing why the work is deemed ESSENTIAL. This means that the work is needed for August 2020 graduation, or for a grant report/application deadline on or before August 14, 2020. All other work should be considered non-essential and planned on for completion at a later date.</p>
<p>If an imaging request or sample drop-off request is approved, the user and Principle Investigator will be notified via email. In addition to the appointment time or sample drop-off time, contact information for the CLIF personnel in charge on the assigned day will be included in the email. This is important, as all electronic key access to the Life Sciences Facility and the CLIF has been removed for everyone except essential personnel. To access the building and CLIF for appointments and sample drop-offs, the user must contact the CLIF personnel in charge upon arrival.</p>
<p>Thank you for your cooperation during this unprecedented situation. We will be back to our normal operations as soon as we can be!</p>
<h3>SOCIAL DISTANCING</h3>
<ol class="flush">
<li>In each capability room, only one user will be allowed at a time. <strong>This means that all trainings and user assistance will be halted</strong>.</li>
<li>For those capabilities where samples can be dropped-off for facility staff to work on them, sample drop-boxes will be provided outside the facility for users to drop their samples. Only samples pre-arranged and pre-approved via email with specific facility staff will be accepted. Results for these samples will be communicated to users through emails or deposited in a BOX account.</li>
</ol>
<h3>GOOD HYGIENE PRACTICES</h3>
<ol class="flush">
<li>In each capability room, there will be alcohol-based hand sanitizer/soap in place. All users will be required to use hand sanitizer before they touch the keyboard/instruments.</li>
<li>In each capability room, there will be a box of &#8216;disinfecting wet wipes&#8217; or alcohol and lens paper. All users will be required to clean the &#8216;keyboard/mouse&#8217;, eye-pieces, focus knobs and any other areas of the equipment that they have touched after their usage.<br /><strong>NOTE:</strong> It is extremely important to make sure that the eye-pieces of any microscope are disinfected properly as viruses may be spread via the eye and through contact with eye secretions!</li>
<li>If gloves are used, hand sanitizer must still be used, as gloves can cause cross&#8212;contamination. Otherwise, gloves should not be worn.</li>
</ol>
<br /><strong>NOTE</strong> <br />It is the CLIF Director&#8217;s right and responsibility to determine which work is deemed urgent and has priority based on business needs. During such circumstances, it is possible that some work may be delayed/postponed until conditions are normalized.
<p>Thank you for your cooperation during this unprecedented situation. We will be back to our normal operations as soon as possible!</p>

<p>Our aim is to minimize all activities performed at Godley-Snell Research Center (GSRC) with the goal of preventing exposure of the GSRC staff to COVID-19, which could result in building closure. Effective immediately, GSRC will not start any new projects and will work with individual investigators and graduate students to bring ongoing projects to closure as rapidly as possible. With minimal staff, we will continue to support projects currently in house. This plan is based on guidance from Federal and State agencies and Clemson leadership.</p>
<h3>CURRENT OPERATIONS</h3>
<p>GSRC animal care staff are deemed &#8220;essential personnel&#8221; and will be responsible for the normal 7 day a week daily care of the animals as usual. GSRC personnel will support scheduled and approved research procedures as needed with the following guidelines:</p>
<ul class="flush">
<li>No new projects or animal orders will be initiated without ADR assurance that the study is essential and cannot be delayed, and authorization by the Director, GSRC. Animal research procedures will be scheduled and limited to minimize the number of authorized people at GSRC at any time. Procedures may be conducted following submission and approval of a service request. Do not come to GSRC unless you have submitted a service request and received a confirmation email. Please be on time.</li>
<li>We have discontinued sign-up sheets at the front door to minimize potential contamination. Everyone should bring their own pen, do not share with others. If you need a pen, ask GSRC personnel to provide one that you will keep.</li>
<li>GSRC personnel will be alternated and staffing will be minimized. We may have only one or two staff available at any time. This includes front office personnel.</li>
<li>Only one project (preferably one person) will be scheduled in any procedure room at any one time. Only the number of people necessary for the procedure will be allowed to enter the facility. Only work together when necessary but still maintain distance as much as possible.</li>
<li>Disinfectant sprays and/or wipes are placed next to each piece of equipment and work area. Users must disinfect all equipment, keyboards and work areas before and after use.</li>
<li>GSRC personnel will disinfect surfaces commonly touched by personnel at least twice daily, including door knobs/handles, light switches, work surfaces, kitchen table and counter, etc.</li>
<li>The GSRC Farm Animal Veterinarian will be working from home and available by phone.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you have any special concerns regarding your research animals or the conduct of your studies, please let us know.</p>
<p>Throughout these modified operations, we will be available by email at <strong><a href="mailto:GSRC@clemson.edu">GSRC@clemson.edu</a></strong>. If you have research animals at any University animal facility, please ensure that you have provided your emergency contact information.</p>
