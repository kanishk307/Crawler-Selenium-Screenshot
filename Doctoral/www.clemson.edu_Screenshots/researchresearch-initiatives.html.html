MUSC was very pro-active in being prepared for, what was at the time, a possible pandemic. Erik assembled the site with his team on the fly, but asked for help recording their approach to testing in a format that could be shared with other communities. My design studio along with design professionals in Charleston are helping to put together this document. We have completed the first version of this document, which is currently in the hands of MUSC to share with other hospitals and communities as a best-practices model to test for viruses in a drive-thru fashion. We expect this to be a living document with multiple revisions and additions over the next few weeks. We are also working with MUSC to design a safe method to administer tests to walk-up patients, which will also be added to this document once designs are completed and vetted.</li>

We developed a battery of survey items to measure these changes and collected around 2,000 survey responses-primarily from college students at four institutions in mid-March. We are submitting papers on these data to journals but welcome consideration of other collaborators. Also, we are very interested in using these survey items with other populations to examine trends or test for differences in populations (for instance, examine health disparities). Also, my research agenda broadly looks at environmental determinants of health. Thus, I would be very interested in examining using remote sensing data of any geolocated cohorts and looking at differences in the built/natural landscape and COVID-19 prevalence/incidence/outcomes.</li>

The first collaborative team (K. Koehler, D. Albano, D. Ivankovic, S. Saccocio and J. Koehler of Prisma Health; and L. Gonzales of Clemson) is investigating the infection control properties of alternatives of the personal protective equipment (PPE) nose and mouth mask, the N-95 respirator. This initiative promotes evidence-based research in a mindset of creativity and innovation by studying the health impact of PPE alternatives. Dr. Kathleen Valentine leads the second collaborative team of 14 faculty and leaders at the Clemson University School of Nursing. We are investigating how to increase knowledge at the level of undergraduate and graduate nursing education in the field of geriatrics. Elders are experiencing the most devastating effects including death when infected with COVID-19. Health care providers require expert knowledge of the functional and physiologic uniqueness of the cultural, racially and ethnically diverse elder population of Appalachia, Upstate, South Carolina.</li>

The questionnaire items of these studies (which I have in both English and Spanish) contain survey measures of intergenerational relations and family household dynamics that I expect would bear directly on the probability of transmission of COVID-19 among household members, particularly within minority communities. These include multi-item indices of familism, intergenerational relations, English (and country-of-origin) language proficiency. These studies also included questionnaire items on parental socioeconomic status, occupational and sectoral employment and work experience (of parents and working-age children), demographic profiles of households (number people, their ages, sex, racial/ethnic/nationality origins, levels of education), and community networks.</li>

The fibers may be packed into columns to create an efficient isolation platform or extruded as films for a lateral flow immuno-assay (LFIA) for use in rapid diagnostics (&lt;15 min) from blood, saliva, urine, or other bodily fluid samples without the need for laboratory equipment. As members of the current state-wide COVID-19 task force diagnostics group, Dr. Marcus and I will utilize our C-CP fiber technology to assist with antibody purification for development of ELISA-based serological tests for the state. Our technology will be further utilized to increase the overall sensitivity of these tests, which will be a vital part of the return to work policies for health care workers in SC.</li>

These operations planning decisions for relief efforts under COVID-19 pandemic face significant challenges due to the fast-evolving COVID-19 situations on patient needs, medical supply availabilities, as well as their evolving forecasts. These dynamically evolving uncertainties present significant challenges for dynamic resource allocation decision making by federal and state emergency management agents. We would like to apply optimization modeling and algorithmic framework to support life-saving medical resource allocation decision making by state emergency management departments and local health care providers amid the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Epidemiologists have made forecasting tools and data for COVID-19 widely available online, making it amenable for emergency managers and health care administrators to utilize the so-called look-ahead policies for prescribing resource allocation decisions over time. We aim to develop a decision-support tool for dynamic allocation of life-saving medical supplies (such as ventilators and PPEs) under various sources of uncertainty, to provide a timely decision support for state emergency management departments and health care providers in mobilizing and distributing of critical medical resources, utilizing available rolling forecasts on the COVID-19 situation.</li>

Currently used surface disinfectants such as sodium hypochlorite, ethanol or hydrogen peroxide provide high level of activity for a limited period of time (typically, less than 4 h). We developed a novel chitosan-based formulation that forms a protective biocidal film on treated surfaces. This film is resistant to rubbing by hand and shows biocidal activity on frequently touched surfaces for at least 48 h. Such formulation could be used as a surface disinfectant either in the form of a spray or as disinfecting wipes. It is advantageous over currently available disinfectants because of its long-term antimicrobial action. In addition, chitosan is a naturally occurring antimicrobial, and its use will satisfy societal demand for greener alternatives to hazardous chemicals.</li>

Remarkably, this highly sensitive assay can be performed with minimal training and equipment. SARS-CoV-2 proteins in saliva will bind to both buoyant and magnetic (BAM) microspheres, thus linking them together in a "sandwich complex" (a magnetic bead on one end of the protein and a buoyant bead on the other). This "two factor identification" allows the complexes to be completely separated from unreacted magnetic and buoyant beads providing high specificity. The BAM assay is read by eye or using a cell phone video capture. We expect this will meet the World Health Organization's ASSURED criteria for diagnostics in resource limited setting (Affordable, Sensitive and Specific, User-friendly, Rapid (10 minutes), Equipment-free and Deliverable). The test would be especially useful in a variety of screening settings. Our team includes investigators from Prisma Health Department of Emergency Medicine, the Sonoco Packaging Institute, USC School of Medicine Greenville, Akadeum Life Sciences Inc., and Biomagnetic Solutions LLC.</li>
