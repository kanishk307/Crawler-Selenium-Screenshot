<h3>Clemson Outdoor Recreation and Education (CORE)</h3>
<h4>Responsible Recreation in the Outdoors</h4>
<p>For many of us, getting outside is our primary form of recreation. Whether it is hiking, biking, paddling or another activity, we need these things in our lives as part of our routine in order to be well. But how do we balance our need to get outside with the need for us to stay safe, to keep others safe, and to minimize our impact on the environment? CORE has some suggestions and resources for you that we hope can help you answer that question for yourself.</p>
<h5><em>Outdoor Adventure Recommendations</em></h5>
<div class="section-container accordion" data-options="deep_linking: true" data-section="accordion">
<section>
<p class="title" data-section-title=""><a href="#panel1a"><strong>Stay close to home.</strong></a></p>
<div class="content" data-section-content="" data-slug="panel1a">
<p>This is not the time to travel extensively. The further you travel, the more chances of contracting or spreading illness. Additionally, many small-town communities that are known for their outdoor recreation opportunities are not equipped to handle large influxes of people at the moment. They need to focus their resources on their communities, not on tourists and visitors.</p>
</div>
</section>
<section>
<p class="title" data-section-title=""><a href="#panel2a"><strong>Avoid popular areas.</strong></a></p>
<div class="content" data-section-content="" data-slug="panel2a">
<p>What are the classic and easily accessible areas to recreate outside near you? Those are places you should not go right now. Overcrowding at popular areas has been a real problem in this time. Not only does this increase the health risks for you and others around you, it has tangible negative impacts on the environment as well. If you absolutely have to go to a certain area, try and choose the least popular times like weekdays and early mornings to get outside.</p>
</div>
</section>
<section>
<p class="title" data-section-title=""><a href="#panel2a"><strong>Plan for having less resources.</strong></a></p>
<div class="content" data-section-content="" data-slug="panel2a">
<p>While a park or trail system may be open, not all of the resources it normally offers may be. Bathrooms may be closed, water fountains turned off, trash cans absent, etc. Make sure you are prepared to do without these resources and are making plans that will reduce your environmental impact like bringing bags to pack out your trash or knowing how to properly use the bathroom outside.</p>
</div>
</section>
<section>
<p class="title" data-section-title=""><a href="#panel2a"><strong>Choose low-risk adventures and plan well for them.</strong></a></p>
<div class="content" data-section-content="" data-slug="panel2a">
<p>Now is not the time to push your limits. Our first responder and medical communities are already stretched thin. Don&#8217;t add to their burden by getting hurt or lost after taking too many risks.</p>
</div>
</section>
<section>
<p class="title" data-section-title=""><a href="#panel2a"><strong>Pick activities you can do solo or that everyone can maintain appropriate physical distance during.</strong></a></p>
<div class="content" data-section-content="" data-slug="panel2a">
<p>Paddling and biking are good examples of activities that can be done with people where everyone can drive separately and stay relatively far from each other while still being &#8220;together&#8221; during the activity.</p>
</div>
</section>
</div>
<h5><em>Outdoor Adventure Resources</em></h5>
<div class="section-container accordion" data-options="deep_linking: true" data-section="accordion">
<section>
<p class="title" data-section-title=""><a href="#panel1a"><strong>Try out some of our favorite websites.</strong></a></p>
<div class="content" data-section-content="" data-slug="panel1a">
<p>Try out websites like <a href="https://www.alltrails.com">alltrails</a>, <a href="https://www.mtbproject.com/">mtbproject</a>, or <a href="https://www.gopaddlesc.com/">gopaddlesc</a>. Try and look for places that seem like they would be less used and try them out. Feel proud that you&#8217;re exploring somewhere new and doing your part to reduce overcrowding issues and risks.</p>
</div>
</section>
<section>
<p class="title" data-section-title=""><a href="#panel2a"><strong>Use social media to stay up to date on the most recent news in your local outdoor community.</strong></a></p>
<div class="content" data-section-content="" data-slug="panel2a">
<p>Local conservation organizations, outdoor-related businesses like guide services, and city governments in popular outdoor recreation areas are all worth following for this kind of information.</p>
</div>
</section>
<section>
<p class="title" data-section-title=""><a href="#panel2a"><strong>Make use of us as a resource!</strong></a></p>
<div class="content" data-section-content="" data-slug="panel2a">
<p>While the CORE program is not operating in its normal capacity, we still have staff that are here for you as resources. Do you have questions about places to recreate locally, the skills and equipment needed for an outing, or need someone to otherwise help plan an outdoor adventure?
