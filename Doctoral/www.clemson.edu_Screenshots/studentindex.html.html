<p>Absolutely. If you have already been admitted to Clemson, we can defer your entry term to Spring 2021 or Fall 2021. If you do not attend another university during that time, your admissions decision should remain the same. Should you enroll in another university during that time, you will have to reapply as a transfer student. If you are still in the middle of the application process and have not received a decision yet, you will need to submit a new application for a different entry term. We can provide a fee waiver code for you so that you do not have to pay the application fee again.

Choose "Clemson University Graduate School" from the list of school choices or have them sent to <a href="mailto:gstranscripts@clemson.edu">gstranscripts@clemson.edu</a>. International students may use the CertiFile service to request official international transcripts. This service is available through the <a href="https://www.applyweb.com/clemsong/index.ftl">Application Portal</a>, under "Manage Your Account".</p>
