<div class="content" data-section-content="" data-slug="general5a">
<p>Symptoms of COVID-19 have been widely reported, ranging from mild to severe. Symptoms may appear 2-14 days after exposure to the virus. Common symptoms are any combination of cough and shortness of breath, as well as at least two of the following: fever, chills, repeated shaking with chills, muscle pain, headache, sore throat, new loss of taste or smell. This list is not all inclusive. CDC recommends consulting your medical provider for any other symptoms that are severe or concerning.</p>

<div class="content" data-section-content="" data-slug="general5b">
<p>We know that people are most contagious when they have symptoms. Whether the virus can be spread before someone has symptoms is currently being evaluated. <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/how-covid-spreads.html?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fcoronavirus%2F2019-ncov%2Fprepare%2Ftransmission.html">More on how COVID-19 spreads</a> is available from the CDC.</p>

<div class="content" data-section-content="" data-slug="general6b">
<p>There is no reason at this time to think that any animals, including pets, in the United States might be a source of infection with this new coronavirus that causes COVID-19. To date, CDC has not received any reports of pets or other animals becoming sick with COVID-19 in the United States.</p>
<p>Pets have other types of coronaviruses that can make them sick, like canine and feline coronaviruses. These other coronaviruses cannot infect people and are not related to the current COVID-19 outbreak.</p>

<p class="title" data-section-title=""><a href="#general5i"><strong>How does it spread and what can I do to prevent it from spreading?</strong></a></p>
<div class="content" data-section-content="" data-slug="general5i">
<p>Coronaviruses, like COVID-19, are most often spread through the air by coughing or sneezing, through close personal contact (including touching and shaking hands) or through touching your nose, mouth or eyes before washing your hands.</p>
<p>To help prevent the spread, the best thing you can do is stay home as much as possible - especially if:</p>
<ul class="flush">
<li>You are sick with COVID-19</li>
<li>You think you might have COVID-19 and have mild symptoms</li>
<li>You believe you might have COVID-19</li>
</ul>
<p>You should also follow <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/prevention.html?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fcoronavirus%2F2019-ncov%2Fprepare%2Fprevention.html">common-sense measures</a> to help protect yourself and others from spreading COVID-19 and other viruses.</p>
<ul class="flush">
<li>Clean and disinfect surfaces that are frequently touched. To disinfect, most common <a href="https://www.epa.gov/pesticide-registration/list-n-disinfectants-use-against-sars-cov-2">EPA-registered household disinfectants</a> will work. See CDC&#8217;s recommendations for <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/cleaning-disinfection.html">household cleaning and disinfection</a>.</li>
<li>Practice social distancing when you can, staying at least 6 feet away from others.</li>

<p class="title" data-section-title=""><a href="#general7a"><strong> Can I wear my own cloth facial covering to the workplace?</strong></a></p>
<div class="content" data-section-content="" data-slug="general7a">
<p>The highest priority for the University is the health and well-being of students, faculty, staff and guests. The University will provide facial coverings to employees in conjunction with the phased return to the workplace. Employees are allowed to wear personal cloth facial coverings following CDC guidance on personal safety practices.</p>

<p class="title" data-section-title=""><a href="#general8a"><strong> When should I wear my cloth facial covering? </strong></a></p>
<div class="content" data-section-content="" data-slug="general8a">
<p>It is recommended to wear cloth facial coverings in public settings where physical distancing (no fewer than six feet) is difficult to maintain, which may include hallways, open work spaces, common areas and meeting rooms. .</p>

<section>
<p class="title" data-section-title=""><a href="#general9a"><strong> Why are facial coverings recommended? </strong></a></p>
<div class="content" data-section-content="" data-slug="general9a">
<p>The CDC advises the use of simple cloth facial coverings to slow the spread of the virus and help people who may unknowingly be symptomatic and at risk of transmitting it to others. The cloth facial coverings recommended are not surgical masks or N-95 respirators, which are reserved for first responders and healthcare providers.</p>

<ul class="flush">
<li>If this is not an option, for employees who accrue leave, the supervisor should discuss the option of using annual or sick leave to accommodate the absence. Clemson University received permission from State HR to utilize either annual or sick leave during the COVID-19 epidemic. In addition, the provisions of the <a href="https://www.clemson.edu/human-resources/benefits/ffcra.html">Families First Coronavirus Response Act (FFCRA)</a> may provide an alternate or additional option for employees, even employees who are not normally eligible for paid leave.</li>
<li>For the COVID situation, for employees who accrue leave, Kronos will allow up to 15 days of advanced sick leave. This means employee who accrue leave may go into the negative for up to 15 days based on their daily standard hours. Employees should submit sick leave via Kronos, using the typical sick leave code in the Kronos system. Upon returning to work, the employee will have all earned sick leave applied to the leave deficit at the rate of 1&#188; days per month (or if part-time, the monthly earning rate) until the deficit has been eliminated; and if an employee separates from employment before satisfying the leave deficit and returns to state employment, the leave deficit will need to be satisfied upon reemployment.</li>
<li>If the salaried employee does not accrue leave and is not able to telecommute, the employee should submit Leave Without Pay via Kronos for time not worked.
