                     <p><strong>How P/NP works</strong></p>
                     
                     <p>At the <strong>undergraduate level</strong>, letter grades of D or better convert to a P (pass) and F grades convert to a NP
                        (no pass) if pass/no-pass grading is selected. At the <strong>graduate and professional levels</strong>, grades of C or better convert to a P, while grades of D and F convert to an NP.
                        <strong>All spring 2020 courses receiving passing (P) grades will count toward degree requirements,
                           including requirements where a minimum grade of C is required.</strong> This policy exception is in accordance with guidance received from the Oklahoma State
                        Regents for Higher Education and will be documented in the University Catalog.

                              <p>The P/NP grading option converts assigned letter grades to either a P (passing) or
                                 NP (not passing) grade, both of which are GPA-neutral and ignored by GPA calculations.
                                 P grades are considered passing, and courses with P grades will count in earned hours
                                 and toward degree requirements. An NP grade indicates “no pass” and indicates unsatisfactory
                                 work in courses on the pass/no-pass grading system. No credit is earned for courses
                                 with NP grades, and they will not meet degree requirements. Courses with NP grades
                                 are ignored in GPA calculations. At the graduate level, NP grades will be considered
                                 similar to UR grades in determining satisfactory academic progress.

                                 impacted OSU classes, are not eligible for pass/no-pass grading. Similarly, graduate
                                 thesis and dissertation classes graded on a SR/UR basis are already graded on a binary,
                                 GPA-neutral basis and are not eligible for electing P/NP grades. Doctor of Veterinary

                                 of the class dates or grade mode.<br>&nbsp;<br>While the decision to request P/NP grading rests solely with each student, we strongly
                                 encourage students to begin consulting with their academic advisors for guidance.
                                 Graduate students should also seek guidance now from their faculty research mentors,
                                 advisory committee members, and/or graduate program coordinators. Careful consideration
                                 should be given if select classes will be required for application to graduate programs,
                                 professional licensure or certifications, etc. In addition, retaining letter grades
                                 for some classes may be helpful for some students for minimum GPA requirements that
                                 could impact eligibility for scholarships, continuing enrollment, honor rolls, etc.

                              <p>Undergraduate students on academic probation (including those admitted on probation)
                                 must earn a minimum semester GPA to be eligible for continued enrollment at OSU (generally
                                 a minimum 2.00 GPA for undergraduates with 31 or more earned hours, or a minimum 1.70
                                 GPA for undergraduates with 30 or less earned hours). It may be advantageous for undergraduates
                                 on probation to keep assigned letter grades of C or higher to raise their overall
                                 GPA to a minimum 2.00. Please consult with your academic advisor. GPA estimator tools
                                 will be available in the secure P/NP request system to help determine how P or NP
                                 grades can impact your GPA.
                              </p>
                              &nbsp;
                              
                              <p>Graduate students: If a graduate student’s overall GPA drops below a 3.00, if a UR
                                 or NP grade is earned during spring 2020, or if the dean of the Graduate College judges
                                 the student’s overall academic performance so warrants, then the student is subject
                                 to being placed on academic probation. Probation may be removed at the end of the
                                 spring semester only after the student brings their overall graduate GPA above a 3.00.
                                 When probation is only due to a UR grade, a spring 2020 SR grade lifts the probation.
                                 Students on probation who receive NP grades will be given an additional grace term
                                 to improve their academic performance and lift the probationary status.

                              <p>Given that honor roll calculations are based on a minimum semester GPA, students would
                                 need at least one spring class with a standard letter grade of A and meet all other
                                 honor roll requirements to be eligible for the President’s Honor Roll or Dean’s Honor
                                 Roll. Some P grades for spring classes will not necessarily prevent students from
                                 being eligible for honor rolls, as P grades are considered equivalent to a C grade
                                 for these purposes. However, an NP (no pass) grade will prevent honor roll eligibility.
                                 See University Academic Regulation 6.11 for honor roll requirements
