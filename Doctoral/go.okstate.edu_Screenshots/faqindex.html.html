                                 yet. Wearing face coverings has been shown to reduce the spread of COVID-19 to others.

Monitor yourself for <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/symptoms-testing/symptoms.html">COVID-19 symptoms</a> by utilizing the <a href="https://hr.okstate.edu/sites/default/files/docfiles/OSU%20Employee%20Return%20to%20On%20Campus%20Work%2005282020_1.pdf">employee checklist</a> and staying home if you experience any symptoms or otherwise feel ill.

                              <p>Many people with COVID-19 have no symptoms, so the Centers for Disease Control and
                                 Prevention (CDC) advises Americans to wear cloth face coverings as a possible way
                                 to protect one another from infection. It is important to note that face coverings
                                 are not a substitute for other prevention efforts, such as hand-washing and social
                                 distancing. Continue to stay 6 feet from others whenever possible and clean hands
                                 frequently. You should carry at least two face coverings with you daily to ensure
                                 that you have a replacement if one becomes unusable while you are on campus.

                                 a face covering upon entering any campus building.” You will be required to wear one

                                 such as hallways, elevators and stairways.
