                        <div class="more_info" role="region">It is highly recommended that employees wear cloth face coverings in KSU public spaces
                           where social distancing measures are difficult to maintain. Such spaces include but
                           are not limited to campus retail stores, libraries, student centers, classrooms, labs
                           and building circulation spaces (hallways, bathrooms, elevators, stairwells and lobbies).
                           Please note – masks do not replace the need for social distancing. A limited supply
                           of disposable masks will be made available to those who do not have access to cloth
                           masks. Employees do not need to wear face coverings while working alone in their offices.
                           Medical/Surgical Masks and N95 Respirator are to be used only by healthcare workers
                           or other approved areas with job specific hazards as determined by the Environmental
                           Health and Safety Department. For the general public, CDC recommends wearing gloves
                           when you are cleaning or caring for someone who is sick. Gloves may also be necessary
                           for employees handling potentially contaminated objects/materials. In most other situations,
                           wearing gloves is not necessary. Instead, practice everyday preventive actions like
                           social distancing (at least 6 feet), washing your hands with soap and water for 20
                           seconds (or using a hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol), and wearing a mask
                           or face covering.
