<div class="js-accordion-content js-accordion-content-9451511 accordion_content typography" id="js-accordion-item-9451511">
<p>Dear members of the Sacred Heart University community,</p>
<p>This week we want to talk a little bit about the logistics for reopening and bringing students back to campus.</p>
<p>Over the past few weeks, the University successfully reopened the Tandet Center in Stamford that houses our physician assistant program and the Center for Healthcare Education on Park Avenue that houses the Colleges of Health Professions and Nursing. This was done, following state guidelines, to accommodate those graduate students in the College of Health Professions who needed to finish labs and clinicals that were not completed during the spring semester.</p>
<p>Prior to the return of faculty and students, we prepared the buildings with signage and directional indicators to ensure social distancing. Everyone involved is wearing masks and are adding shields when the lessons necessitate closer quarters. Everyone is taking their temperature before entering classrooms and will stay home if they have a temperature or other symptoms.</p>
<p>We are beginning to narrow down dates for the return of the rest of the student body, and we wanted to share them with you.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Early dropoff</strong>—Students who want to drop off their belongings into their rooms prior to move-in days will be able to do so by appointment from August 8-18. Information will be coming from residential life about how to make an appointment. This will be for drop-off only. No unpacking should take place until the official move-in days.</li>
<li><strong>Freshman Move-in</strong>&nbsp;will take place August 25-27. Day and time will be determined by room assignments and will be sent out to freshmen in late July.</li>
<li><strong>Upperclass Move-In&nbsp;</strong>will be August 28-30 and also based on room assignment. Look for information in late July.</li>
<li><strong>Travel Planning</strong>—Students who need to make reservations on public transportation, such as planes or trains should choose a date in the correct time frame above and then should notify residential life of the date of arrival on campus. You can make that notification by emailing&nbsp;<a href="mailto:reslife@sacredheart.edu">reslife@sacredheart.edu</a>. Be sure to educate yourself on any quarantining regulations that may be in place here at the time of your arrival.</li>
</ul>
<p>In all cases, we ask that no more than two family members or friends accompany students for move-in.</p>
<p>Connecticut state guidelines for the opening of universities change according to the rate of infection, so the dates above are subject to change. For example, Connecticut recently announced that visitors from states experiencing a high level of increase in the virus will have to quarantine for 14 days upon arrival. If that is still in effect during move-in, it may impact some of you.</p>
<p>That said, we know that many of you are anxious to make your plans for move-in, so we are sharing our current thoughts on it. You will continue to receive updates on the processes and procedures for move-in through various University communications.</p>
<p>We are not planning to send out a coronavirus communication next week, so we hope that you all have a great holiday week. As you enjoy the holiday and make plans with family and friends, we want to remind you to be careful, wear masks, practice social distancing and wash your hands. The virus is still very much out there, so it is not time to relax our guard. We want all of you to stay safe and healthy.</p>
<p>Thank you,&nbsp;<br><br>The Coronavirus Planning Team</p>

<span class="accordion_trigger_label_prefix">June 19: SHU-Flex Learning - Technology Needs</span>
</span>

<div class="js-accordion-content js-accordion-content-9450076 accordion_content typography" id="js-accordion-item-9450076">
<p>Dear members of the Sacred Heart University community,</p>
<p>This week’s update focuses on the technology needs of SHU-Flex learning, recommendations for your personal equipment and what SHU is doing to ensure the University is prepared as we continue to navigate our way through this epidemic.</p>
<h2>Recommended Equipment</h2>
<p>We recommend that all freshman and transfer students bring a laptop computer to allow for participation in and outside of the classroom environment. The University incorporates the Blackboard Learning management system and Echo 360 lecture capture recording, along with a myriad of video collaboration tools and Microsoft Office. For maximum success, your device should be capable of supporting these tools. The laptop you use should have a baseline technical requirement of:</p>
<ul>
<li>Windows 10 or MacOS 10.15</li>
<li>256 SSD GB hard drive,</li>
<li>8gb of ram</li>
<li>i5 core processor</li>
<li>13-inch display</li>
<li>wireless network connectivity</li>
<li>microphone and camera</li>
</ul>
<p>We also recommended that you have headphones to improve your online web conferencing interactions.</p>
<p>Course work may also utilize Google and Adobe tools, so a scanner app (e.g. Genius Scan) is also recommended. In addition, you should also have multiple internet browsers installed on your computer (Firefox, Chrome for PC users or Safari/Chrome for Mac users). Additional technology resources may be added at the discretion of the course instructor.</p>
<p>Upper-class students who selected a computer from the recommended laptop options during freshman year already have a device capable of meeting the expected technology demands.</p>
<p>Students who use MACs are responsible for ensuring that they are using a newer operating system and that the course instructor can view all submitted assignment files on a PC computer. We do not recommend that you use phones, iPads, Chromebooks, readers or similar tablets as a primary device for completing course assignments.</p>
<p>In addition to a robust and reliable network that allows for anytime, anywhere learning, we also have numerous computer labs for general student use at the Park Avenue Campus, Martire and West Campus as well as a dozen specialized computer labs for specific classes. If you need access to a computer, you may use any of the following spaces when classes are not in session as long as you follow our risk-mitigation measures (mask, social distancing, etc.): HC111, W122, W239, RH-art lab, E1006, E1039, E1129, cyberlab, W109, W114, W118, W133, W141, W146, W208, W213, W217 and W213.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you have additional questions related to computer options, please refer to the laptop acquisition information on the website for a detailed description of laptop options supported by our Factory team.</p>
<p>You can also contact our support team at&nbsp;<a href="mailto:TechSupport@sacredheart.edu">TechSupport@sacredheart.edu</a>. For any questions or general information, contact&nbsp;<a href="mailto:InfoTech@sacredheart.edu">InfoTech@sacredheart.edu</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Internet Connections</h2>
<p>Internet connections vary across the U.S. and can affect video calls and conferencing. Per FCC regulations, a high-speed broadband connection is determined to have download speeds of 25 Mbps. The higher the number, the better. You can check your speed by visiting <a href="https://fast.com/" target="_blank">https://fast.com/</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Printing</h2>
<p>When you are on campus, you can print documents in room HC113. This room is available to students 24/7. You can also print/scan and copy at any of the existing 25 multifunction printers around campus. Here are&nbsp;<a href="/offices--departments-directory/information-technology/shupad-print-and-delivery/duplicating-center/how-to-connect-a-printer-to-your-computer/">instructions</a>&nbsp;on how to print.</p>
<h2>Student Success Center</h2>
<p>We realize the online components of SHU-Flex will be new for many of you. We want you to know that the staff at the student success center is always available to support your academic success. Be sure to reach out to them any time for assistance with online classes and coursework or for any academic support you may need.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>They are in the process of creating a resource library to help you navigate in the event you find yourself in need of some guidance, clarity or motivation. The resource library will be completed by August and will include information on things like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9EV5tvhxQd8&amp;feature=youtu.be" target="_blank">visual retrieval</a>, organizational skills,&nbsp;<a href="/media/shu-media/jandrisevits-learning-center/Graphic_Organizer_Online.pdf">graphic organizer</a>&nbsp;and <a href="https://sway.office.com/PWtPXV4DR0I8np3O?ref=Link" target="_blank">much more</a>. The center can be contacted at&nbsp;<a href="mailto:studentsuccess@sacredheart.edu.&nbsp;">studentsuccess@sacredheart.edu.&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We hope this information is helpful as you prepare for the coming academic year. The University is hard at work getting the campus ready for your return, and we look forward to seeing you soon.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Have a great weekend,</p>
<p>The Coronavirus Planning Team&nbsp;</p>

<span class="accordion_trigger_label_prefix">June 5: CARES Act</span>
</span>
<span class="accordion_trigger_icon"></span>

<div class="js-accordion-content js-accordion-content-9450072 accordion_content typography" id="js-accordion-item-9450072">
<p>Dear members of the Sacred Heart University community,</p>
<p>In this week’s message, we will attempt to answer the many questions we have received regarding financial matters. This will include refunds and information about the CARES Act funds and other resources for help for those who need it.</p>
<p>Throughout the COVID-19 period, the University has striven to act fiscally responsibly and fair to our students’ families during this challenging period, while stewarding the University’s resources to ensure we can continue to provide a quality educational experience.</p>
<h2>Meal Plans</h2>
<p>The University is adjusting meal plans to reflect the reduction in the number of days students will be able to use their fall plan.&nbsp;The adjustment, which varies by plan, will be reflected in your June billing statement. The eliminated Columbus Day four-day weekend and an earlier move-in date will in part offset reduced meals after Thanksgiving, and we have made a prorated reduction for freshman and sophomore plans to reflect the net number of days that students will not be on campus in preparation for any possible virus resurgence.&nbsp;The Red &amp; White meal plans for upper-class students, which are smaller declining balance plans, will have increased fall-to-spring carryover allowances.</p>
<h2>Room Charges</h2>
<p>Traditionally room charges have covered the length of the semester rather than a daily charge. We will continue our policy of charging a per-semester residence hall rate vs. charging additional fees or refunding payments for one- to two-week differences in access to the halls. Therefore, housing costs will remain as reflected on students’ current bills.</p>
<p>With the health and safety of students as our primary concern, the University is providing additional cleaning and sanitizing of the residence halls, campus classrooms, common spaces, restrooms and shuttles. The University will lease additional beds to allow us to spread students out and for quarantining if needed, and we will considerably expand our health services.</p>
<p>Some of you have commented on what other schools are doing, which is understandable. It’s important to note that the circumstances may differ for each institution. For example, in the spring, we credited/refunded room and meal plan charges to our families and suspended all late fee charges, while other institutions that did not do that then are doing so now.</p>
<h2>Tuition</h2>
<p>We will not offer a tuition refund as we are continuing to teach for the standard number of hours. Hybrid classes are necessary if we are going to meet the social distancing demanded by the state for us to bring our students back to campus. Our faculty is attending workshops and classes and brainstorming among themselves to ensure the learning experience will be vibrant, challenging, rewarding and fun—both in the classroom and online.</p>
<h2>CARES Act</h2>
<p>Sacred Heart University is in receipt of its funds from the federal CARES Act: Higher Education Emergency Relief Fund, which provides grants for students who were enrolled last spring for expenses related to the disruption of campus operations due to the COVID-19 crisis. Eligible undergraduate students will receive a $400 emergency grant from this fund. You do not need to take any action at this time. Your relief funding will be sent to your direct deposit refund preference, as defined with Bank Mobile, on Monday, June 8. You can review your preference online at&nbsp;<a href="http://www.refundselection.com/" target="_blank">www.refundselection.com</a>. Please allow up to 72 business hours from June 8 for the funding to become available in your bank account.</p>
<p>Please note, this relief funding is not taxable; however, it will be included in box 5 of your 2020 1098T tax form.</p>
<p>Eligible students who are experiencing greater financial distress can apply for additional emergency funds for COVID-19-related expenses. The application and instructions on student eligibility and qualified expenses are now available below.</p>
<h2>Sacred Heart Student Emergency Fund</h2>
<p>The University has allocated funds to support financial assistance in the form of financial aid and incremental emergency grants to families challenged by this environment. In addition, the Student Emergency Fund, which has been funded by donations from alumni, trustees, faculty and staff, is also available to those who need additional help—especially students who are not eligible for CARES ACT funding. To apply for these funds, use the application on the coronavirus page.</p>
<p>We hope this has answered your questions. We appreciate your patience as we make these decisions and create the processes to best get these relief funds into your hands.</p>
<p>Have a great weekend,</p>
<p>The Coronavirus Planning Team</p>

</span>
<span class="accordion_trigger_icon"></span>

<div class="js-accordion-content js-accordion-content-9448961 accordion_content typography" id="js-accordion-item-9448961">
<p>Dear members of the Sacred Heart University community,</p>
<p>The primary focus of this week’s message will be the measures the University is implementing to ensure the health and safety of students, faculty and staff as we prepare to repopulate the campus in preparation for fall classes. We have received a variety of questions about this, and we want to take the opportunity to respond.</p>
<p>Some College of Health Professions graduate students will return to the Center for Healthcare Education in Fairfield and the Tandet Building in Stamford in the next couple weeks to complete clinical labs and other requirements that were delayed by coronavirus restrictions. Those students have been notified of processes and procedures in a separate communication. The University is hard at work securing the necessary supplies and making the adjustments needed to ensure that everyone is as protected as possible when the bulk of our students return in late August.</p>
<p><strong>Initial Return to Campus</strong></p>
<p>All students, faculty and staff will be asked to take their temperature before leaving for campus. Anyone with a temperature of 100.4 or higher will need to remain at home. This will continue to be a daily process before leaving home or a residence hall for campus. Currently state guidelines for reopening require that everyone take a test for COVID-19 upon their return to campus and that residents be tested again 10 to 14 days later. We are working out the details of how that will take place. If someone tests positive, they will be placed in quarantine and contact tracing will take place.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When arriving on campus, all vehicles will be asked to stop at the welcome booth. Move-in will be spaced over the course of a week, and we are asking that no more than two additional people accompany each student for move-in. We will also be providing an opportunity for students to drop their belongings off in their rooms prior to move-in week. More details about how you can make an appointment for early drop-off will be forthcoming.</p>
<p><strong>Protocol for Residence Halls</strong></p>
<p>Per the state’s reopening guidance, students sharing a room or suite will be considered a “family unit” and will not be required to wear a mask while together within the room. Masks will be required in all common areas such as hallways, lobbies, bathrooms and study/lounge areas. Common areas will be cleaned frequently and thoroughly, and there may be plastic partitions in between sinks in bathrooms. There also may be some restrictions regarding guests in the residence halls.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Protocol for Campus Common Areas</strong></p>
<p>For the health and safety of everyone, all students, faculty and staff will be required to wear masks whenever they are outside their dorm rooms or offices. Social distancing will be in play with everyone keeping six feet apart in all common areas. Some pedestrian areas may be one-way only. All areas will be clearly marked. There will be more opportunities to use outdoor spaces with additional tables outside of dining halls, such as 63’s and JP’s. In addition, many student activities, club meetings, etc. will take place outdoors. Recent guidance from health officials suggests that we are much safer outside in terms of viral spread.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Classrooms and Offices</strong></p>
<p>Because of the need to practice social distancing, fewer people will be allowed in classrooms and offices than previously. This means that classes will be hybrid with lessons both in classrooms and online.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Study Abroad</strong></p>
<p>The University has made the decision to cancel study abroad programs for the fall. We are disappointed that this is necessary because we recognize the importance and breadth of this kind of experience. We hope to accommodate the students who planned to go abroad during an upcoming semester, and we will work to find on-campus living accommodations for students who planned to be abroad and now want to live on campus.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Pioneer Promise</strong></p>
<p>There will be an ongoing educational campaign to ensure that everyone understands the new protocols and their role in keeping the community healthy. Our slogan will be “Our Wellness at SHU is up to You.” We will ask all students, faculty and staff to sign a document that we are calling the Pioneer Promise. It is a commitment to the new policies to protect us all, but that promise will begin with you.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>CARES Act Funds</strong></p>
<p>Updated information about the distribution of CARES Act funds can be found on the University’s coronavirus page.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We are sharing what we know as we know it. The policies described above are based on conditions from the state of Connecticut for reopening, along with guidance from local and national health officials and the recommendations from our four task forces. The situation with the coronavirus remains fluid, and it’s possible that some of this will change by the time we start classes. The University task forces are meeting regularly and keeping abreast of any changes and updates from state and health agencies. Still, there is no doubt that things will be different than we have been used to. There will be challenges, but we are a community that rises to the occasion when challenges confront us. We are also a community where closeness and caring are baked into our culture. If we continue to care for and help one another as we always have, we will not only adjust, but we will thrive.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you—and have a great weekend.</p>

<span class="accordion_trigger_label_prefix">May 22: SHU Answers Questions About the SHU-Flex Model to Reopen Campus</span>
</span>
<span class="accordion_trigger_icon"></span>
</button>
<div class="js-accordion-content js-accordion-content-9448962 accordion_content typography" id="js-accordion-item-9448962">
<p>Dear members of the Sacred Heart University community,</p>
<p>Last weekend, we gave you a broad overview of the SHU-Flex model and the University’s plans and protocols for on-campus, face-to-face learning in the fall. Since then, several other universities, such as Notre Dame, Creighton and Rice, have announced similar plans to finish on-ground classes before Thanksgiving. Our plans must be consistent with the guidelines set forth by the State of CT and the CDC, which continue to evolve. Since last week’s message, we have received several questions from you that we will address below. We thank you for your continued patience. In an ideal world, we would not be making any changes at all, but we must adapt our usual way of functioning to maximize the health and safety of the entire SHU community.</p>
<p>As a reminder, the University is planning to begin fall semester classes for undergraduate students as planned on Monday, August 31. However, as part of a plan that we are calling SHU-Flex, we are finishing face-to-face classes for undergraduates early for health and safety reasons. We are eliminating the Columbus Day weekend break and plan to conclude on-campus activities before Thanksgiving break. We are also encouraging graduate courses to complete on-ground activities before Thanksgiving when possible.&nbsp;This plan is designed to mitigate the risk that comes when the majority of the University population travels away from campus and then comes back. We believe this is especially critical since the regular flu season also begins around that time.</p>
<p><strong>Q. Won’t we miss out on some of our education with two fewer weeks in the semester?</strong></p>
<p>A. No.&nbsp;<strong>We had stated that we’d planned to conclude the undergraduate semester by the Thanksgiving break, but we are clarifying that</strong>.&nbsp;On-ground, face-to-face instruction for undergraduate courses will conclude by Thanksgiving, but the academic calendar will not change. There is now greater flexibility on the part of the instructor to determine exactly how and when each specific course will end, but regardless there will be no face-to-face instruction for undergraduate courses after Thanksgiving, with very rare exceptions.</p>
<p>In cases where the instructor ends the class by 11/24, students would&nbsp;not&nbsp;have fewer instructional hours than they would during a regular 15-week semester. The number of instructional hours will be—and must be—the same as always. This will be achieved by blending in the 4-5 hours (on average) of missed instruction over the course of the 13 weeks of the semester (e.g., extra 20-30 minutes a week of online discussion).</p>
<p>It is also possible that an instructor may choose to hold classes, albeit virtually, following the Thanksgiving holiday. This time may also be used for projects, papers, and/or online final exams. Instructors will make clear to students at the start of the fall term exactly what to expect in the course for the fall so that students may plan accordingly.</p>
<p><strong>Q. I’m concerned that it will be a much more difficult semester when we combine so much into two fewer weeks.</strong></p>
<p>A. Your deans and professors are committed to maximizing your chances of academic success. The student success center will continue to provide various academic resources to support students in their studies. Tutors will be available in all subjects; the Online Writing Lab will run for the entire semester; and the center will provide supplemental instruction in a variety of ways to students—both through group workshops and individual delivery. Supplemental instruction will be available both in person and online.</p>
<p>It’s worth noting that an option for many of you to lighten your course load in the fall is to take a summer or a winter course. The student success center has tripled the number of tutors available to support those taking summer courses. Tutors are available to help students with both course content and general academic success strategies, including how to perform well in an online context.&nbsp;</p>
<p>At Sacred Heart, we take pride in meeting students where they are and supporting them as they challenge themselves. Whether you decide to study online, take summer courses or follow this year’s fall semester schedule, we have employees throughout the University who are expressly dedicated to student success.</p>
<p><strong>Q. If you want to be done by Thanksgiving, why don’t you just open earlier as other schools are doing?</strong></p>
<p>A. The short answer is that we are unable to do that because it is prohibited by the current CT regulations and guidelines. Regulations vary from state to state depending on the severity and timing of the epidemic, and we must follow the guidelines of our state and local officials. Here in Connecticut, we cannot move students into residence halls before August 24, and we will need the bulk of that week for proper testing and to ensure social distancing during move-in.</p>
<p><strong>Q. If I am nervous about coming back to campus, will I have the option of taking classes online from home?</strong></p>
<p>A. Yes. You should check with your College dean or academic adviser, but most students will have the option to remain at home while taking classes online. The exception might be students who need to be present for clinical courses or labs. If you are planning to stay home, please notify your adviser and also Larry Wielk, dean of students, as soon as possible. His email address is&nbsp;<a href="mailto:wielkl@sacredheart.edu">wielkl@sacredheart.edu</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<h2>CARES Act Funds</h2>
<p>We have also received quite a few questions about the CARES Act funds. Information can be found further down on the this page.&nbsp;We will update the information there as things change.</p>
<p>The plan that we have laid out for the fall allows the University to adapt to the prevailing health conditions and evolving guidelines of our state and local officials. We hope that this message provides further clarity. We will continue to update you as the various task forces make more decisions and provide more details. We are looking forward to an exciting and engaging semester beginning in just 12 weeks! In the meantime, practice social distancing and wash your hands!</p>
<p>Have a great holiday weekend!</p>

<div class="js-accordion-content js-accordion-content-9448963 accordion_content typography" id="js-accordion-item-9448963">
<p>Dear members of the Sacred Heart University community,</p>
<p>This week we want to provide some more information about the University’s planning for the coming semester. There are many details still to be finalized, but we want to give you as much information as we can to help you with your planning. As you might expect, Sacred Heart is following the guidelines recently provided by the governor for the reopening of universities as well as guidance from health experts.</p>
<p>The health and safety of the SHU community has always been our top priority in concert with ensuring the academic continuity that allows our students to complete the requirements needed for their chosen degrees. We recognize that providing an opportunity for students to interact, build friendships, participate in clubs and activities and develop bonds with faculty members is a critical part of the college experience and woven into the fabric of life at Sacred Heart. While there will need to be procedural changes for everyone’s safety, we are determined to provide those experiences to students.</p>
<p><strong>The Fall Semester – Introducing SHU-Flex</strong><br>Sacred Heart is planning to begin fall semester classes as planned on Monday, August 31. However, as part of a plan that we are calling SHU-Flex, we are condensing the undergraduate academic calendar for safety reasons. We are eliminating the Columbus Day weekend break, but plan to conclude the semester before Thanksgiving break. The plan ensures that students receive the same number of instructional hours as always, with no changes to their already assigned course schedules, but will mitigate risk by limiting trips back and forth to campus that may require additional testing and possible self-isolation. Since most of our graduate students are nonresidents and would present less risk,&nbsp;the graduate calendars will not change,&nbsp;although graduate programs are encouraged to complete on-ground activities before Thanksgiving when possible.&nbsp;This plan is based on the University’s goal to achieve the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Maintain a safe campus environment through social distancing requirements and other risk-mitigating procedures</li>
<li>Maintain teaching excellence whatever the circumstances</li>
<li>Comply with all accreditation standards and guidelines</li>
<li>Mitigate health risk and minimize travel to home during the semester for residential undergraduate students</li>
</ul>
<p>To plan for all contingencies, SHU-Flex ensures that the University’s faculty will be prepared to deliver course material both face-to-face and virtually to allow for flexibility for students in various circumstances as well as social distancing requirements. It also enables them to seamlessly switch to alternative modes of teaching at a moment’s notice should a spike in the virus require a change in plans.</p>
<p>In preparation, faculty will participate in development courses and workshops beginning immediately and continuing throughout the summer. We had to pivot quickly this past spring with very little warning, and students and faculty alike did an exceptional job of adapting to the necessary changes. With the time we now have to plan and prepare, we are confident that our hybrid classes will allow for the same close connections with your professors and fellow classmates that we know you value. Our faculty members are excited about the creativity that a hybrid format allows for classes to be more engaging and challenging than the traditional format. And should we need again to move fully online, you will find the experience robust and interactive.</p>
<p><strong>Health and Safety</strong><br>The wellness task force is also preparing for reopening with the purchase of more than 50,000 masks, along with 30,000 gallons of hand sanitizer, face shields and thermometers, the installation of 80 hand sanitizer pumps at building entrances, signage for social distancing and acquisition of tests. They have also made plans for contact tracing and containment should someone test positive.</p>
<p>In addition, the University is working with its cleaning company, SSC, and carefully planning and implementing comprehensive and frequent cleaning and disinfecting protocols as recommended by the CDC and the American College Health Association for reopening institutions of higher education in the COVID-19 era.</p>
<p>Some additional protocols from the wellness task force that you may see in place include, but are not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mandatory wearing of masks outside of dorm rooms and offices</li>
<li>Extended move-in period</li>
<li>Limited guests on campus and between residence halls</li>
<li>More takeout and mobile ordering options from dining halls</li>
<li>Specified working areas for study groups that are easily sanitized</li>
<li>More creative use of indoor and outdoor spaces, such as outdoor liturgies as weather permits</li>
<li>Use of video for class guest speakers and colloquia</li>
</ul>
<p>We realize that some of this information is very broad. The task forces are working hard to develop these plans, and we will continue to share their decisions in these weekly updates.</p>
<p><strong>University Staff</strong><br>Although the governor has indicated that university business offices can start to reopen beginning Wednesday, May 20, Sacred Heart will not immediately transition staff back to campus. It will be done in a thoughtful, careful way while keeping the safety of everyone in mind. More information about staff transitioning will come from HR by the beginning of June.</p>
<p><strong>Housing and Meal Credits</strong><br>The student accounts team has completed the process regarding housing and meal credits. Billing statements have been published for the applicable students. Please review your&nbsp;<a href="/offices--departments-directory/student-accounts/">student account information by logging online</a>.&nbsp;Requests for refunds of the meal plan credit may be submitted online at the student accounts website.</p>
<p>Congratulations again to all who received their degrees through the conferral ceremony last weekend. We continue to look forward to the on-ground ceremony that the commencement committee is planning with class of 2020 student leaders.</p>
<p>As we continue to evolve in response to the world we now live in, we are determined to preserve all that makes us the close, caring community we have always been. We are Pioneers, so we will be bold, innovative, creative and resilient. Some things may be different, but we are still the same—immersed in our mission, our traditions, our inclusiveness and our love for one another. See you in the fall.</p>

<p>Dear members of the Sacred Heart University community,</p>
<p>Wednesday, Connecticut Governor Ned Lamont came out with guidance for reopening colleges and universities. The good news is that the recommendations are in line with the discussions and planning that are already taking place among Sacred Heart’s task forces that are preparing for the fall semester and beyond in the wake of the coronavirus. These recommendations include:</p>
<p>A gradual reopening of the campus over the summer hopefully leading to a full reopening for the fall semester</p>
<ul>
<li>Begin May 20 with research programs and some administrative functions<br>Reopen in early summer for workforce development programs that require onsite work, such as labs and clinicals. This particularly applies to students who were unable to complete requirements for the spring semesters</li>
<li>Allow undergraduate residential institutions to reopen at the end of summer for the fall semester—if prevailing health conditions allow</li>
</ul>
<p>The governor’s guidance was clear that certain health conditions must be met before these openings can take place. These are:</p>
<ul>
<li>The prevalence of the disease must be low enough to allow the safe resumption of campus operations</li>
<li>Institutions that will be housing students 24/7 must have access to enough COVID-19 tests so that entering students, faculty and staff—even if asymptomatic—can be tested upon arrival and periodically throughout the semester<br>
<ul>
<li>Anyone testing positive must be immediately isolated</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>An adequate capacity for contact tracing must be provided to the higher education institutions</li>
</ul>
<p>Colleges and universities will be required to file a reopening plan with the Connecticut Department of Health that will detail plans for repopulating campus, likely in phases; monitoring for infection; containing spread if infection is detected; and shutting down campus should it become necessary. As we stated above, Sacred Heart is already well prepared to begin a phased reopening in preparation for on-ground classes in the fall.</p>
<p>As we gear up for a full reopening, we have been procuring the necessary PPE supplies, including thousands of wipes, masks and gallons of hand sanitizer. The University is also working with its health partner—Orthopaedic Specialty Group—to procure its own tests and contact tracing capabilities. We are developing safety and cleaning protocols to limit the chance for an outbreak on campus, and finalizing plans to contain infection when and if that becomes necessary.</p>
<p>In the coming weeks, we will provide more information on our reopening plans.</p>
<p>We have made the decision not to hold summer camps on campus this year, and we expect that some—if not all—of our pre-fall programs will not take place. This is being done to allow the University to fully sanitize and prepare the campus for the start of the new academic year in the fall.</p>
<p>Some of you have asked about the timing of the refunds for rooms and meal plans. The team in the Office of Student Accounts appreciates your patience as the details regarding the previously announced housing and meal credit were finalized.&nbsp;Specific details will be shared under a separate email to all applicable students.&nbsp;If you do not receive the detailed update by Tuesday, May 12, you may contact the Office of Student Accounts at&nbsp;<a href="mailto:StudentAccountsOffice@sacredheart.edu">StudentAccountsOffice@sacredheart.edu</a>&nbsp;for additional information.</p>
<p>We learned yesterday that Sacred Heart has been named a Tier 1 school by Educate to Career in its new ranking about college planning in the time of COVID-19. The ranking has four tiers. Sixteen Connecticut colleges were ranked, and SHU is one of three in Tier 1. Colleges in Tier 1 have these characteristics:</p>
<ul>
<li>A physical campus for in-classroom instruction should the health authorities allow colleges to open in September</li>
<li>Robust software and systems to support distance learning programs</li>
<li>Faculty experience in teaching online</li>
<li>Reasonable tuitions &amp; fees on a relative basis</li>
</ul>
<p>We knew Sacred Heart was a leader in responding to the pandemic, but it’s nice to have some outside validation.</p>
<p>Congratulations and good luck to all students who will have&nbsp;<a href="/commencement/virtual-conferral-of-degrees/">degrees conferred</a>&nbsp;on them Saturday and Sunday. The ceremonies are at 10 a.m. Saturday for graduate students and 10 a.m. Sunday for undergraduates. There is also a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhY6OtQx56I&amp;feature=youtu.be" target="_blank">pinning and awards ceremony&nbsp;</a>for nursing graduates at 2 p.m. tomorrow. As we have said many times, we are working with the Class of 2020 leaders to plan an in-person graduation where we can all celebrate together as soon as it is legal to do so.</p>
<p>In closing, we want to wish a happy Mother’s Day to all the moms among our students, faculty and staff as well as moms of our students. We hope you will enjoy our special&nbsp;Mother’s Day concert&nbsp;on Sunday at 11 a.m. featuring the Timmy Maia Experience.</p>
<p>Have a great weekend!</p>

<p>Dear members of the Sacred Heart University community,</p>
<p>Last week, we shared our hope that the University community will be on campus for the beginning of the fall semester barring any restrictions from health officials and/or the governor. University leadership is proceeding on the assumption that classes will be on-ground and are considering the actions we will need to take to ensure everyone’s health and safety once we are back together.</p>
<p>Our plan to offer a full on-campus program for both residential and commuter students will not come without temporary changes to our typical way of campus life. There will be new procedures and practices that will ensure the wellbeing of our community. There are still many decisions to be made and scenarios to be considered by the task forces we told you about, but some of the things they are considering include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Requirements for testing/lab results for students, faculty, staff and university business partners</li>
<li>The use of masks during classes and in public gathering spaces</li>
<li>Institution of capacity limits to allow for social distancing in spaces such as workout/exercise facilities and dining halls</li>
<li>Modification of programs and events for compliance with limits on crowd sizes and social distancing measures</li>
<li>Enhanced sanitizing and cleaning processes</li>
<li>Continued use of online and virtual platforms in conjunction with in-person services (a “hybrid” approach) to keep in-person contact at safer levels in the areas of academic instruction, counseling, student life programming, spiritual programming and more</li>
<li>Changes to campus access for visitors</li>
<li>Enhanced wellness resources to fully support the unique emotional, spiritual and physical wellness needs of our students, faculty and staff</li>
</ul>
<p>We will continue to update you as decisions are finalized.</p>
<p>We have received some queries about the construction projects on campus. Since the state did not ever shut down construction, the work on our new residence and dining halls and on the parking garage has continued, and those projects are expected to finish on time. The garage should be completed before the end of August, and the residence halls will be ready for move-in for the spring semester. Everyone on campus has been following the health and safety precautions and guidelines as they went about their work.</p>
<p>SHU’s own John Ratzenberger, who you know from Cheers, Empire Strikes Back and every Pixar movie ever made, is spearheading our participation in Tuesday’s Giving Tuesday Now, an extension of Giving Tuesday, in response to the great need resulting from the pandemic. In the case of SHU, funds raised will go to the Student Emergency Fund to help our students who have been financially impacted by the virus-related shutdown. To hear John talk about his career and time at SHU (live at noon and then available for viewing) or to make a gift,&nbsp;<a href="/offices--departments-directory/university-advancement/giving-tuesday-now/">visit our website</a>&nbsp;on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Since we are not on campus because of the virus, students will need to ship any rental books back to the bookstore. The books are due Wednesday, May 6. You should have received emails that include a free label. Print the label, package up your book(s) and drop the package at a FedEx store. Please include your name, phone number and email address with the book for check-in purposes. You can also generate your free shipping return label in My Account at <a href="https://www.bkstr.com/sacredheartstore" target="_blank">www.sacredheartshop.com</a>. To accommodate shipping, we have extended our non-return window by 15 days.</p>
<p>The weather is supposed to be nice Saturday and Sunday, so please enjoy the upcoming weekend!</p>

<p>Dear members of the Sacred Heart University community,</p>
<p>This week, we are sharing with you some work the University is doing to respond to these unprecedented times—both internally and out in public.</p>
<p>The focus right now is on getting students back on campus for on-ground classes and experiences as soon as we are able to do so safely. We realize that the reopening of campuses (like the rest of the economy) will be gradual and will mean modifications to ensure everyone’s safety. To that end, we are looking at a variety of scenarios and contingencies. That said, Sacred Heart is planning to resume our on-campus, residential program in the fall of 2020, following the recommended best health practices of the CDC and guidance from the Governor. After the health and safety of our community, getting students, faculty and staff back on campus is the University’s top priority.</p>
<p>Working behind the scenes on our responses to this pandemic and our plans to get back to campus are a group of task forces appointed by President Petillo. Each task force is appropriately populated with the University staff and faculty with the knowledge and experience to tackle the issues before them, and these leaders are bringing in others throughout campus as needed. We have already shared some of the decisions that have been made, including decommissioning some buildings, opening up others to first responders and much more. These task forces cover the full range of University operations that have been affected by this crisis.</p>
<p>As its name suggests, there is a fall semester task force planning for several scenarios for learning as we head to the beginning of the next academic year and look at the various contingencies under which we can return to campus. The community wellness team is working to ensure the physical, mental and spiritual health of the SHU community and putting in place whatever is needed to maintain it. This can range from informational programs and sharing sessions to providing face masks and hand sanitizer and implementing robust cleaning protocols. They are also examining the lessons learned from this experience that can help us under similar circumstances in the future. The business continuity task force is ensuring that the University continues to run efficiently, maintains its financial stability and is able to pivot quickly to respond to rapidly changing business environments. The campus operations &amp; emergency housing team has been making decisions about decommissioning buildings, offering housing to first responders and what both areas will need to maintain safe, clean and healthy environments. There is a reimagining the University task force that is considering what the University of the future might look like given the times in which we live and how education, business and the marketplace has changed so dramatically. Finally, the communications task force has been (and will continue) keeping you informed as information becomes available and decisions are made. That group is also looking at ways to constantly improve communications, University-wide, going forward.</p>
<p>Throughout this crisis, University faculty, staff, students and alumni have been coming up with some creative ideas to help others during this crisis. <a href="/news-room/news-listing/sacred-heart-uses-its-resources-to-help-during-pandemic/">You can&nbsp;read about some of them on our website.</a></p>
<p>In addition, for the past few weeks, the SHU food truck has been providing breakfast free of charge for frontline workers at Bridgeport and St. Vincent’s Hospitals, and we are making plans to expand to lunch and dinner offerings.<a href="https://mms.tveyes.com/PlaybackPortal.aspx?SavedEditID=e33c3ecc-94f7-4939-98c6-cf6d00f6d5be" target="_blank">&nbsp;View the coverage from News 12.</a></p>
<p>Launched with a generous gift from a trustee, the University has started a&nbsp;<a href="https://weareshu.sacredheart.edu/project/20483/wall" target="_blank">relief fund</a> for students who are experiencing financial distress because of the pandemic. Students will be able to apply for grants from the fund.</p>
<p>Yesterday was the University’s annual Academic Festival where students present projects that they have been working on for most of the year—including during the past six weeks of distance learning. The festival was virtual this year with students posting their research on&nbsp;<a href="https://digitalcommons.sacredheart.edu/acadfest/2020/" target="_blank">Digital Commons</a>g&nbsp;&nbsp;and uploading video presentations of their work. Many students participated in the live stream, which included the awards ceremony. Click the link above to see their incredible work.</p>
<p>Let’s continue to pray for the sick and their loved ones and look forward to the time when we will all be together again.</p>
<p>Have a good weekend!<br>The Coronavirus Planning Team</p>

<p>Dear members of the Sacred Heart community,</p>
<p>We have a few updates for you as we head into the weekend.</p>
<p>First, in response to an executive order from the City of Bridgeport and strong guidance from Governor Lamont, we are now requiring everyone to wear a mask while on campus whenever they are near or interacting with others. This includes students staying in Bergoglio except when they are alone in their rooms. Resident hall directors have already been through the hall distributing masks to those staying there. An additional distribution will take place tonight for those who were missed.</p>
<p>Second, the University’s Commencement Committee is continuing to plan on-ground commencement services for graduate and undergraduate students in the class of 2020. Members of the committee are meeting regularly with senior class leaders and are committed to having a memorable event to celebrate your accomplishments. In the meantime, we will hold a virtual conferral ceremony on May 9 and 10 to acknowledge the earning of degrees. This will in no way replace walking across the stage when your name is called, but it will allow you to claim your degree for job hunting or licensing purposes. More information about how to connect to this will be sent out in the coming days.</p>
<p>Regarding caps and gowns, those who preordered caps and gowns will receive an email from Herff Jones to provide information so they can be mailed to you at no cost.&nbsp;The email will also include information for those who did not preorder cap and gowns and now wish to do so.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Third, WSHU is launching a podcast to update listeners on the latest with the coronavirus outbreak in our region. It officially launches on Monday and will drop every evening, Monday through Friday. It will give people a convenient source for updates on the pandemic in Connecticut and New York and will explore dimensions of the story ranging from science to economics and politics as well as society and culture. Listeners can find the podcast on the <a href="https://www.npr.org/podcasts/834133004/c19" target="_blank">WSHU website</a>, Apple Podcasts and Google Play.</p>
<p>In closing, we want to remind everyone to please fill out the <a href="https://forms.microsoft.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=xFmCf5HE9Uel5amfUya5dmbvACxOprVOrZJpX_GNNvRUNE1HQ1RaTzYxNUlOWk9MM0k4MFdJV0dORCQlQCN0PWcu" target="_blank">technology survey</a>, so that IT can provide us all with the tools we need to be successful while social distancing.</p>
<p>Have a great weekend, everyone!</p>

<p><strong>Reminder: Friday and Monday are University Holidays</strong></p>
<p>Dear Members of the Sacred Heart University community,</p>
<p>Once again, we come to you with an update on the University and information that you might find helpful. We want to start by reminding you that you can contact us with your questions or comments at&nbsp;<a href="mailto:coronavirusplanning@mail.sacredheart.edu">coronavirusplanning@mail.sacredheart.edu</a>. We will respond as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>We also want to remind staff that the University has added Easter Monday as a holiday this year. We hope you will take the extra time to focus on your personal health and wellness. For example, faculty have been invited to join the special Spring Faculty Institute on resilience and self-care with tips for staying healthy and positive as you support our students.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We want to remind everyone that we are restricting access to campus to those essential workers who need to report there for work. Everyone else needs permission from their division vice president—even for a quick visit to pick up something. This includes walking around the grounds outside. We have made this decision to protect the health of all our employees.</p>
<p>The latest guidance from the CDC and federal government is that everyone should wear face masks in public places. In addition, we want to remind everyone that social distancing remains critical. Experts believe that our diligent efforts are starting to flatten the curve just as we are nearing the predicted peak for this area. Relaxing our social distancing protocols will lead to a new wave of the virus.</p>
<p>The University is starting a student emergency&nbsp;<a href="https://weareshu.sacredheart.edu/project/20483" target="_blank">fund</a> to raise money for those students who are confronting unexpected personal expenses as a result of the virus. We have received many queries from within and outside the community asking how to help. We will provide more details about the fund next week, but a gift to this fund will have an immediate impact for those students who are struggling to meet expenses for basic needs while continuing their education.</p>
<p>President Petillo was with Representative Jim Himes on&nbsp;<a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1JZTrlnH-AxbJj67k2mMh-5O2JJ8phmWV/view" target="_blank">Instagram Live</a> yesterday. The two discussed the ways the pandemic is impacting higher education.</p>
<p>Effective Monday, shuttle service will be temporarily discontinued because of low ridership. Public safety staff will provide transportation to students living in Bergoglio Hall who need a ride to Target and/or Stop &amp; Shop. Students in need of this service should call 203-371-7995 by 10 a.m. on the day they need to shop, and a time for transportation will be arranged.</p>
<p>As you know, we will be planning commencement exercises for graduate and undergraduate students once it is safe to do so. Cap and gown pickup originally scheduled for&nbsp;April 23-24 will be rescheduled for a later date. You can check the&nbsp;<a href="/commencement/">commencement page </a>on our website&nbsp;for updated information about commencement.</p>
<p>In closing, we want to remind you that Holy Week Masses will be available virtually beginning with The Holy Thursday liturgy at 3 today. The Good Friday service of the “Seven Last Words” will go live tomorrow, at 3; and the Easter Sunday liturgy will go live Saturday at 3 p.m. You will find links to them on&nbsp;our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/SacredHeartUVideo/videos" target="_blank">YouTube page</a>. Please continue to pray for the sick, for our frontline workers and for our leaders.</p>
<p>We wish you a restful four-day holy weekend. Stay well and healthy.</p>

<p>Dear faculty and staff,</p>
<p>We want to make you aware that a staff member has tested positive for coronavirus and was on campus during the time he or she could have been contagious. The individual has notified everyone he or she had contact with while on campus and those staff people are self-quarantining for 14 days.</p>
<p>Because the next few weeks are expected to be the peak for the virus locally, only employees with prior approval of their divisional vice president will now be allowed on campus. This will be the case until further notice. We have made this decision for your safety and the safety of everyone on campus, and we appreciate your cooperation.</p>
<p>Please continue to stay safe, and please pray for all inflicted with this virus—especially those in our community.</p>

<p>Dear members of the Sacred Heart University community,</p>
<p>Once again, we come to you with an update on the University and how we are meeting the challenges of this unprecedented time. We have been receiving questions and comments from you through a number of avenues, and we are doing our best to respond to all of them as quickly as possible. If you want to reach the Coronavirus Planning Team, you may do so by responding to any of these emails we have sent or by emailing us at&nbsp;<a href="mailto:coronavirusplanning@mail.sacredheart.edu">coronavirusplanning@mail.sacredheart.edu</a>.</p>
<p>This week’s message includes reminders, new information and answers to some of the questions we have received, but before we get into that, we want to say how much we are hoping and praying for the good health of everyone in our community. Please be safe out there.</p>
<p>That said, we want to share some information for all employees in case you should become ill. Please notify your supervisor and Sally Schettino, manager for human resources, at&nbsp;<a href="mailto:schettinos@sacredheart.edu.&nbsp;">schettinos@sacredheart.edu.&nbsp;</a>She will assist you with the sick leave policy during the period of your illness.</p>
<p>If you are still reporting to work and get sick, stay home.&nbsp;<strong>DO NOT</strong>&nbsp;come to campus. If you are concerned that you may have contracted the coronavirus, call your health-care provider to help you to determine whether self-isolation or self-quarantine is needed.</p>
<ul>
<li>If you are told to self-quarantine, even if you are not symptomatic, stay home and notify your supervisor.</li>
<li>If you are not symptomatic during the period of self-isolation or self-quarantine, and working from home is feasible, you may coordinate with your supervisor to telecommute during that period.</li>
</ul>
<p>We want to remind faculty and staff that all international and domestic business travel remains on hold until further notice. When we eventually return to campus, it’s possible we will ask you to fill out a domestic travel form—similar to what we did with international travel after spring break. Stay tuned.</p>
<p>We want to thank all the students who have completed registration for fall. Fall 2020 advising and registration will continue through the add/drop period, and our registrar staff is available to assist students virtually. Undergraduate students may send any inquiries and registration issues to&nbsp;<a href="mailto:registrar@sacredheart.edu">registrar@sacredheart.edu</a>. For assistance with summer 2020 registration, graduate and undergraduate students are asked to please email&nbsp;<a href="mailto:pitchera@sacredheart.edu">pitchera@sacredheart.edu</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Students can also request one-on-one sessions with someone from the student success center who can walk them through how to find open sections of courses and how to look for required courses or assist anyone who still needs to register. Email&nbsp;<a href="mailto:sorrentinoc3@sacredheart.edu,&nbsp;">sorrentinoc3@sacredheart.edu,&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;<a href="mailto:yuranc@sacredheart.edu">yuranc@sacredheart.edu</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href="mailto:heffrons@sacredheart.edu">heffrons@sacredheart.edu</a>&nbsp;to set up an appointment.</p>
<p>Students who paid for and lived in the residence halls or had a meal plan this spring will receive a communication early next week with information on how the partial credit will be applied to student accounts.&nbsp;Please note that for students who are not graduating this spring, this credit will be available for use against tuition, room, board or fees for the summer 2020 term through the spring 2021 term only.</p>
<p>We have received some questions about internships. The WCBT career services team is available to help students in the Welch College of Business &amp; Technology who are having trouble setting up a summer internship this year. Anyone who needs help should get in touch with them as soon as possible. In addition, career services is available to help all students—graduate and undergraduate—to find virtual internships. On April 22, they will host the University’s inaugural Virtual Career and Internship Fair.&nbsp;All students and alumni can participate.&nbsp;Career services has also been hosting weekly “Virtual Career Days,” including a series of virtual resume referrals and ‘on-campus’ virtual interviews. Students interested in learning additional details can visit <a href="https://sacredheart.joinhandshake.com/login" target="_blank">Handshake</a>.</p>
<p>We remain committed to rescheduling our commencement ceremonies for both undergraduate and graduate students, but we are unable to set a date because there are too many unknowns connected with the spread of the virus.</p>
<p>The University, students, faculty and staff continue to do all they can to help those in need during this crisis. We shared many examples last week, and you have probably seen some news reports about our opening up residence halls to first responders and medical personnel. In addition, the College of Nursing made a gift to Bridgeport Hospital of the equipment from its simulated hospital rooms for the hospital’s emergency patient tent.</p>
<p>Sacred Heart is also donating unused computer bandwidth to help research potential cures for the coronavirus. The University’s IT department downloaded software, provided by the organization Folding@Home, on computers in the WCBT’s IDEA Lab and Artificial Intelligence Lab. Our computers are currently contributing to the top 3% of Folding@Home’s calculations.</p>
<p>We want to remind you that Holy Week Masses will be available virtually beginning with tomorrow’s Palm Sunday service. The Palm Sunday liturgy went&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ilNNd-LxXrs&amp;feature=youtu.be" target="_blank">live</a> today at 3 p.m. The Holy Thursday liturgy will go live on Thursday, April 9, at 3; the Good Friday service of the “Seven Last Words” will go live on Friday, April 10, at 3; and the Easter Sunday liturgy will go live Saturday, April 11, at 3 p.m.</p>
<p>Again, we want to remind you that counseling services are available to the community. We are in unprecedented times, and there is much change and uncertainty. Let’s share our thoughts with one another and our loved ones. Counselors are available to students by calling 203-371-7955. All members of the community can reach out to campus ministry at 646-748-6808. Employees have access to the University’s Employee Assistance Program.</p>
<p>Stay well and healthy.</p>

<p>Dear members of the Sacred Heart University community,</p>
<p>We want to take a moment to update you on the decisions that have been made and the many things happening in response to the coronavirus and the forced isolation we are experiencing.</p>
<p>First, we need to share that we have a second confirmed case of coronavirus where the individual may have been on campus during the 14-day contagious period. Those who may have had contact with the infected individual have been notified. Again, we will not report all cases within our community—only those where the individual was on campus at a time he or she may have been contagious. This seems a good time to remind you that we all need to be diligent about social distancing and hygiene. All classes, workshops, study groups, etc. need to be taking place virtually. Let’s also keep all the sick in our prayers, especially those in our own community.</p>
<p>As of this afternoon, all SHU students who were studying abroad have arrived back in the U.S. Thanks to the global affairs team for everything they did to help these students arrive home safely. In the same vein, all summer study abroad programs—in Dingle and elsewhere—have been cancelled. Students who had registered for these programs have been informed of their options.</p>
<p>Registration is under way for online summer classes. Students may use their room and board credits to pay for summer online classes. In addition, there is a 10% discount on tuition, and the $115 registration fee has been waived.</p>
<p>We currently have 37 students remaining on campus. They are all living in Bergolio Hall, and dining services are available to them at Linda’s. In the meantime, we have decommissioned the following buildings for savings on utilities, cleaning, etc.: Pitt Center, Bobby Valentine Recreation Center, chapel, Martire Center, library, student success center, wellness center, West Campus, Center for Healthcare Education, JP’s Diner, Wiesel, Frassati and Toussaint. We are in talks to possibly use some of our facilities to house medical personnel and first responders.</p>
<p>Even though we are apart geographically, everyone is doing a tremendous job staying in touch virtually and electronically. In addition to our online classes, there are many great instances of our virtual connections. There are too many to list, but here are some examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>Virtual tours for prospective and admitted students and a daily livestreamed information session for prospective students</li>
<li>Virtual office hours for students with the faculty</li>
<li>Virtual counseling from the wellness center, student success center and career counseling center</li>
<li>Virtual meetings for clubs and activities</li>
<li>Now We Are All Homeschooling weekly series. The first installment took place Thursday with Dean Michael Alfano and two of our alumnae offering tips and advice. More than 1,300 people have clicked on the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/119331371443492/videos/220634622380689/" target="_blank">link to the video</a>.</li>
<li>Virtual lunch hours, virtual Masses and even virtual yoga</li>
<li>Alumni are sharing words of encouragement for our current students –&nbsp;<a href="/offices--departments-directory/alumni-engagement/stay-connected/words-of-encouragement/">view some of their comments</a></li>
<li>A virtual blessing of the hands is planned for nursing alumni tomorrow</li>
</ul>
<p>In true Pioneer fashion, members of our community have been doing what they can to help those in need. As you would expect, there are—again—too many to mention, but here are some:</p>
<ul>
<li>The College of Nursing has donated all its PPE supplies to St. Vincent’s Medical Center, Nuvance Health (Danbury, New Milford, Norwalk and Stamford Hospital), Bridgeport Hospital and CT Hospice</li>
<li>Faculty in the School of Computer Science &amp; Engineering are working toward manufacturing masks using the University’s 3-D printers</li>
<li>Monday Night Social—an inter-professional clinic that aims to increase social participation and community integration among young adults with neurodevelopmental conditions and intellectual disabilities will continue virtually. It was pioneered by the Sacred Heart University graduate occupational therapy faculty and students in 2014 and is now run by both the OT and SLP programs</li>
<li>Occupational therapy students and their professors are working toward delivering online telehealth-type programs to CCAR, a recovery community center based in Bridgeport. They have also offered to design a similar service for Bridge House and Merton House</li>
<li>Occupational therapy students had planned to go to Sarasota, NY, in June with the American Veterans Archeological Recovery service learning program. They and their faculty are currently planning a virtual service learning experience that will include online mental health supports, psychoeducational activities and virtual chronic pain interventions</li>
</ul>
<p>So thank you to all of you for your efforts to safeguard your own health and that of those around you, for your creative solutions for keeping in touch with each other, with our admitted and prospective students, with our alumni and friends of the University and the greater community. And thank you for your generosity and ingenuity as you seek to help those in need during this crisis.</p>
<p>Have a good weekend,</p>
<p>The Coronavirus Planning Team</p>

<p>Dear students, parents, faculty and staff,</p>
<p>We have the first confirmed diagnosis of coronavirus in the SHU community. The student&nbsp;lived off campus and visited the University campus only twice since spring break. The student has already been in touch with everyone&nbsp;this person had contact with in the past two weeks. The symptoms in this case are very mild.&nbsp;For privacy reasons, we cannot give out any additional information specific to this case.</p>
<p>The number of cases in Connecticut continues to grow. Therefore, going forward, we will only issue updates on cases where a person was on campus within two weeks of diagnosis. With the number of people in the SHU community, it is likely that more of us will be diagnosed before this is over. Please continue to follow the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prepare/prevention.html?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fcoronavirus%2F2019-ncov%2Fabout%2Fprevention.html" target="_blank">CDC guidelines</a> for hygiene, and stay well. If you have specific questions about coronavirus, you can call the State of CT hotline at 2-1-1.</p>
<p>Our prayers go out to everyone who is ill with coronavirus, especially those in our own community.</p>

<p>Dear students and parents,</p>
<p>I want to follow up on the email that I sent on Saturday with updates on the decisions we have made since then regarding commencement and rebates. First, though, I want to thank you for all the supportive messages you sent over the weekend. They were greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>I have been having ongoing conversations with student government and senior class leaders about commencement. Unlike the announcements that have come from other schools, we remain committed to holding commencement exercises for the class of 2020. The current information we are receiving on the pandemic has led to the decision that commencement will not take place in May. We will continue to communicate with you as plans are firmed up. Seniors, I promise you that it will be a memorable celebration of all your hard work for the past four years.</p>
<p>We also made the decision to offer prorated credits for unused board and food plans. You may have already seen the information on our&nbsp;<a href="/offices--departments-directory/health-services/coronavirus/">SHU coronavirus page</a>. Students who have left campus will receive a partial credit for room charges that can be credited to their accounts for next fall. The same will apply to meal plans. For graduating seniors, the credit will be refunded upon student request or left on account for graduate studies in the fall. There will be no tuition credit as we are continuing to teach. We are still working on the logistics for how these credits will work, and I will update you once we have the process ironed out.</p>
<p>The whole world is in unprecedented territory here, and I am proud—but not surprised—of the way you are handling the upheaval this has caused in your lives. I miss you all and can’t wait until we can be together again on campus.</p>
<p>Thank you,</p>

<p>Dear students,</p>
<p>In a typical year, the counseling center at Sacred Heart University is here to assist students with a variety of concerns. This can be, but not limited to, adjusting to being away from home, relationship issues, depression and other emotional or psychological needs. This year has been quite different as you all know. Classes are now online, activities are canceled, all sports seasons have ended and everyone is encouraged to maintain social distance. The above-mentioned issues have not gone away for some students and added concerns about the coronavirus have upended our lives and increased our anxiety.</p>
<p>While our service delivery is changing, we will continue to deliver to you the same quality counseling as in the past. Beginning Wednesday, March 18, we will provide counseling sessions to any student who requests an appointment. The session will be conducted virtually using a HIPAA-compliant platform. To schedule an appointment, please call 203-371-7955 and leave a message or email Mary Jo Mason at&nbsp;<a href="mailto:masonm@sacredheart.edu">masonm@sacredheart.edu</a>.</p>
<p>In addition, there will be a counselor on-call 24/7. To access this counselor, please contact Public Safety at 203-371-7995 and identify yourself as a SHU student. The counselor will be contacted and will reach out to you. However, if you or someone you know is feeling suicidal, you can call the National Suicide Prevention Hotline at 1-800-273-TALK (8255) or call 911.</p>

<p>Dear faculty and staff,</p>
<p>As we continue to follow the fluid and rapidly evolving coronavirus crisis, and in light of our move to online learning for the rest of the semester, we are now making the decision to move eligible employees to telecommuting.</p>
<h2>Working Remotely</h2>
<p>While the university remains open, we are now identifying employees who can work remotely. We need to ensure that the University continues to function, while also taking every precaution to reduce the chance of bringing the virus to campus. Telecommuting will begin tomorrow—Tuesday, March 17—and will continue until further notice.</p>
<ul>
<li>Eligible employees should work from home when possible, provided it does not interfere with university operations (see&nbsp;<a href="/offices--departments-directory/human-resources/employee-information/policies--communication/telecommuting-policy/">telecommuting policy</a>).</li>
<li>Eligible employees are those whose functions can be performed remotely as determined by their supervisor and approved by their divisional vice president.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Eligible employees should take with them tonight whatever they need to successfully work from home. They should also forward their work phones to their home or cell phones. We expect all phones to continue to be answered in a timely way as we continue to serve our students, parents, alumni and other stakeholders.</li>
<li>Eligible employees should determine that they have&nbsp;remote access&nbsp;before planning to telecommute.</li>
<li>Supervisors will also assess whether certain employees have extra capacity or time given the reduction in on-campus activity, and whether those employees can perform additional or other duties in support of business continuity.&nbsp;</li>
<li>With the best interests of the University in mind, Sacred Heart may, at any time, ask a telecommuting employee to return to campus to work.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>We are taking these measures not only to protect those employees who will be telecommuting, but also those who will need to remain on campus in jobs that cannot be performed from home. Reducing the population of folks on campus will allow the remaining employees to better practice social distancing and other safety measures.</p>
<h2>Staff Who Cannot Work Remotely</h2>
<p>While we are encouraging employees to telecommute, some positions (by nature of their responsibilities) cannot work remotely. We are asking those employees to follow the guidelines below to ensure safety and minimize risk associated with the further spread of infection:</p>
<ul>
<li>Absolutely do not come to work if you are feeling sick (see sick leave section below for more information).</li>
<li>Implement social distancing practices to reduce close contact in the workplace (e.g. maintain a distance of 6 feet from coworkers).</li>
<li>Conduct all meetings by conference call/WebEx.</li>
<li>Limit any group discussions or gatherings to no more than four employees.</li>
</ul>
<h2>This Section Only Applies to Essential Employees Who Are Reporting To Work</h2>
<p><strong>If you get sick, stay home. Do NOT come to campus.</strong></p>
<p>Your health and the health of our community is our primary concern. Please follow the University's sick policy, and notify your manager if you are sick.</p>
<ul>
<li>If you are concerned that you may have contracted the coronavirus, call your health-care provider to help you to determine whether self-isolation or self-quarantine is needed.</li>
<li>If you are told to self-quarantine, even if you are not symptomatic, stay home and notify your supervisor.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Sick Leave</strong></p>
<p>We will ensure that all employees are able to stay at home during the required 14-day period of self-isolation or quarantine.</p>
<ul>
<li>If you have been directed by your health-care provider to self-isolate or self-quarantine because of a coronavirus diagnosis, symptoms or your exposure to a known coronavirus case, you should stay home. You will be provided leave for the mandated self-isolation/self-quarantine period up to 14 calendar days. This means that you will be given up to 10 business days of coronavirus leave, and the time will not impact your accrued sick days or short-term disability.</li>
<li>If you use up the 10 business days of coronavirus leave, refer to the sick leave policy.</li>
<li>If you are not symptomatic during the period of self-isolation or self-quarantine, and working from home is feasible, you may coordinate with your supervisor to telecommute during that period.</li>
</ul>
<p>Please reach out to your supervisor, or human resources for guidance about any additional issues or concerns that you have. Please also remember that the University’s EAP program is available to you if you need to talk to someone. The toll-free number (1-800-854-1446) and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.unum.com/employees/services/life-balance" target="_blank">website</a> are available to you 24 hours a day, 365 days a year.</p>
<p>There is financial stress on us as a result of this crisis, as you can imagine, and we are reviewing options to solidify the long-term position of the University. We will continue to keep you informed about all our plans moving forward. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>We appreciate your understanding and flexibility. Please continue to refer to the University’s&nbsp;<a href="/offices--departments-directory/health-services/coronavirus/">coronavirus page</a>&nbsp;for updates and information.</p>
<p>Thank you for all you have done and will continue to do as we navigate this uncharted territory. Sacred Heart has a reputation as a close and caring community, and that is because of what all of you do every day for our students. It will take each and every one of us, but we are confident that working together, we will come through this challenge stronger than ever.</p>
<p>Thank you,</p>
<p>The Coronavirus Planning Team</p>

<p>Dear students and parents,</p>
<p>I want to thank you for your continued patience as we work through the best way to respond to the ongoing coronavirus health crisis. Please know that we are committed to doing what is best for the health and safety of our students.</p>
<p>We have received many questions from you about commencement. I met with a group of senior student leaders yesterday, and we had a great conversation. While we do not know yet if we will be able to hold commencement in May, we are committed to ensuring that there will be commencement exercises for the class of 2020 at some point.</p>
<p>We have also received questions regarding potential refunds for unused room and board. We are working on answers to those questions now and will let you know as soon as we reach a decision. Certainly, financial matters are important, but I trust that you will understand that our top priorities now are the decisions that directly affect the health, safety and future of our students, faculty and staff. These include feeding and housing those students unable to get home, ensuring that seniors in all disciplines are able to complete the necessary requirements for graduation and more. We will address the less time-sensitive issues as soon as we can, and we will continue to keep you informed on all fronts.</p>
<p>We appreciate your patience.</p>

<p>Dear students,</p>
<p>Yesterday there were several external announcements that impact individuals, groups and institutions differently. Sacred Heart University has made the decision to interpret or expand them in the following ways. These decisions have been made for the health and safety of the SHU community. They are in keeping with the advice of many health officials and reflect what other universities, community groups and organizations are doing.</p>
<ul>
<li>ALL D1 team activities, regardless of the season, will cease immediately. That includes tournaments, games and practices.</li>
<li>ALL club sports activities will cease immediately.</li>
<li>As a result of both the Governor’s directive and guidelines issued by the town of Fairfield, all performing arts activities will cease immediately.</li>
<li>In keeping with the previous decisions, all student activities, projects and gatherings will cease immediately.</li>
<li>We know that there are students for whom Sacred Heart is their only home. Effective Saturday, if a student intends to remain in University housing, the Office of Residential Life needs to be notified; if we do not hear that students are remaining, the room will be secured centrally, and students will not be able to enter.</li>
<li>Residential Life will provide a schedule for an orderly exit from the residence halls for those who choose to leave.</li>
<li>If you choose to leave, we are asking that you remove all your belongings as on-ground courses most likely will not take place for the remainder of the semester.</li>
<li>All students in graduate and undergraduate courses that require labs and clinicals will receive a separate email from their respective dean with specific information and instructions.</li>
</ul>
<p>Again, these difficult decisions have been made with the best interests of our community members in mind. Our faculty remains committed to providing high-quality classes on line and ensuring that all students are able to complete their semester requirements through distance learning. Any students with questions and concerns should contact their professors, advisers, deans or the student success center.</p>

<p>Dear students, faculty and staff,</p>
<p>We are aware that there is a rumor that we have had two nursing students test positive for the coronavirus. That is&nbsp;NOT&nbsp;the case. Two clinical nursing students were in the presence of a patient who is being tested for potential coronavirus. As a precaution, the students did not return to campus and are self-isolating at least until the test results on the patient come in. Should the test be positive, they will remain in isolation for the full 14 days.</p>
<p>Given the decisions of the U.S. government regarding international travel, we have made the decision to have all study abroad students return to their homes where they will continue their studies online. The Office of Global Affairs is providing logistical guidance and support.</p>
<p>Given that the World Health Organization declared the coronavirus a pandemic yesterday, you should be prepared for the continuation of classes that are currently online for the foreseeable future. We will maintain a high-quality learning experience and see that students successfully continue their studies. In particular, we are committed to ensuring that seniors complete the necessary requirements for graduation. We are fully equipped for this.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The NCAA announced this afternoon that all winter and spring sports are cancelled. The Northeast Conference (NEC) has announced that the remainder of the 2020 NEC Women’s Basketball Tournament and the upcoming NEC Women’s Bowling Tournament are canceled, and all spring sports conference play is suspended. Atlantic Hockey has canceled the remainder of the 2020 tournament, including SHU’s quarterfinal game that was slated for tonight.</p>
<p>In the interest of further facilitating social distancing on campus, Sacred Heart University has made the additional decision to suspend all intercollegiate team and individual competitions until further notice.</p>
<p>The plays scheduled for the next two weekends in the Little Theatre have been cancelled.</p>
<p>Students can choose to return home and pursue their studies online from there, but the campus remains fully operational, and services continue to be available to students. This includes residence halls and dining services for those who choose to stay. Anyone with questions or concerns should not hesitate to contact professors, academic advisers or deans. The counseling center is also available to help with any uncertainty, unease, anxiety or stress. You can contact them at 203-371-7955.</p>
<p>We will continue to update you as things evolve. For additional information and answers to frequently asked questions (FAQs), please visit&nbsp;our&nbsp;<a href="/offices--departments-directory/health-services/coronavirus/">coronavirus page</a>&nbsp;on the website.</p>
<p>Thank you for your patience and adaptability as we continue to take proactive measures to prevent and mitigate the risk of a coronavirus spread on campus. You continue to exemplify the very best of SHU, and we appreciate it.</p>

<p>I want to take a moment to clarify the University’s recent decisions in its effort to mitigate the risk of coronavirus.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While we still think the risk to our campus is low, we are seeing community spread in neighboring states and across the country. There are currently no known or suspected cases of coronavirus on our campus. We know that we cannot eliminate all risk, but we want to take any steps we can to minimize it. With that in mind and based on the recommendations of many, we decided to be proactive and exercise an abundance of caution now.</p>
<p>To help mitigate the growing risk of transmission, we moved most classes online, postponed or cancelled major events and suspended nonessential travel. For students who choose to stay, we are maintaining all academic support services, residence and dining halls and recreational services.&nbsp;<strong>Additionally,&nbsp;all admitted student days, tours and athletic events will continue as planned.</strong></p>
<p>The CDC and local health officials are recommending that we all practice social distancing. Social distancing means avoiding situations where large groups of people are gathered in close proximity for extended lengths of time. This includes classrooms, meeting rooms, event spaces and more. The health and safety of our community members are always our top priority, so to minimize the risk of large gatherings and close quarters, we are using online tools for classes and meetings wherever possible. Where possible and appropriate, we will continue to support educational, student life and athletics activities that require physical presence. That includes some clinical labs and other select courses. While we are doing our best to limit our clinical labs, we also want to ensure that students are able to effectively finish their programs of study in a timely manner.&nbsp;In-person clinicals are necessary for graduation and licensing, and we don’t want to put those in jeopardy if we can avoid it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For more information, we have a frequently asked questions (FAQs) document on our&nbsp;<a href="/offices--departments-directory/health-services/coronavirus/">coronavirus webpage</a>&nbsp;that we are continually updating. Students with academic concerns can continue to work with our student success center by calling 203-371-7820. If you are experiencing anxiety or excessive stress, you can reach out to the counseling center at 203-371-7995.</p>
<p>These decisions were not made lightly. A signature strength of Sacred Heart is our close, caring community, our day-to-day and face-to-face interactions, our small classes and strong relationships between professors and students. We understand that these measures are inconvenient and disruptive, but we believe they will help minimize the risk to the well-being of our community members and the larger community. We are constantly monitoring the situation and are committed to returning to normalcy as soon as we are able.</p>
<p>As we have said all along, this situation is extremely fluid. We will continue to respond accordingly and update you as new changes are made. The coronavirus planning team has been working hard to make the best decisions based on the information at hand. I ask all of you to support their work and policies, which have been made with the best interests of the SHU community in mind. Again, our strength has always been the way we care for one another. We need that caring and understanding now more than ever.</p>
<p>Thank you,<br>John J. Petillo</p>

<p><em>This message was sent on behalf of Rupendra Paliwal and Donna Bowers</em></p>
<p>Dear students, faculty, and staff,&nbsp;</p>
<p>We wanted to follow up on the announcement on moving instruction online beginning on Wednesday and until further notice.</p>
<p>You should know that the decision was not taken lightly, but it was the most responsible decision, given the recommendations from public health officials to avoid when possible bringing together groups of people for events and gatherings in spaces that do not allow for social distancing. We want to emphasize that there are no known or suspected cases of coronavirus on campus, but we want to provide faculty, students, and staff with as much guidance as possible.</p>
<p>In order for students to meet the required hours needed for course progression and graduation, lab experiences and clinical and public school placements may need to continue on ground. The final determination will be made by the deans in consultation with program directors. Should students wish to leave their placements or not attend on site labs, the decision may impact their graduation or progression. We will continue to monitor agency regulations and will adjust them if possible.</p>
<p>We have asked that faculty provide their students with maximum flexibility to accommodate this change and that decisions be based upon fairness and what is most supportive of students. We should seek to minimize anxieties for our students as much as possible, especially related to how this might impact student progress toward their degree and future career prospects.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We deeply appreciate all that faculty are doing to ensure that our educational, research, and service missions continue, as we lead our students and the community through this unprecedented public health challenge.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The University’s leadership is continuing to work closely with public health officials to keep up to date on the situation and to implement appropriate policies. For more information about the coronavirus and the University’s response,&nbsp;<a href="/offices--departments-directory/health-services/coronavirus/">visit&nbsp;our dedicated website.</a></p>
<p>A great many decisions will need to be made in short order, and we will continue to update you as soon as possible. With patience, compassion, and cooperation on everybody’s part, we’ll get through this together.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sincerely,&nbsp;</p>
<p>Rupendra Paliwal<br>Provost and Vice President for Academic Affairs</p>

<p>Welcome back from break. In today’s update, we want to tell you about the precautions we have taken—and will continue to take—to protect the University community from the coronavirus. These are precautions recommended by the CDC and local health agencies:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bathrooms in all University housing have been disinfected in anticipation of students’ return</li>
<li>Touchpoints (doorknobs, faucets, flushers, etc.) will be disinfected daily with more frequent cleaning and sanitizing of public/common restrooms</li>
<li>Extra attention is also being paid to athletic areas because of the high traffic flow<br>
<ul>
<li>Gym equipment is disinfected daily and wiped down with Clorox wipes</li>
<li>Hand soap is available in all rest rooms and hand sanitizer can be found throughout the gym area</li>
<li>Clorox disinfecting wipes are also available throughout the gym area. These kill 99.9% of all bacteria in 10 seconds</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>In addition, extra protocols will be in place in dining halls<br>
<ul>
<li>Food services personnel will go above and beyond in following CDC hygiene guidelines Hand sanitizers will be available to workers at all food preparation sites</li>
<li>Touchpoints (doorknobs, horizontal services, tables &amp; chairs, condiment dispensers, drink dispensers, etc.) will be cleaned often</li>
<li>In addition to other locations on campus, portable sanitizer stations will available for students, faculty and staff in the dining halls</li>
<li>We ask that you practice good food hygiene—don’t touch food with your hands (a piece of fruit, for example) and then put it back</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Cleaning staff is available 24/7 to respond to any emergencies anywhere. Monday through Friday from 7 a.m. to 4 p.m., call&nbsp;203-371-7870. Nights and weekend, students should report issues to their RHD to submit an off-hours MOP request</li>
</ul>
<p>We are also asking that all students and employees do their part by following the hygiene guidelines set forth by the CDC:</p>
<ul>
<li>Avoid close contact with people who are sick</li>
<li>Avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth</li>
<li>Stay home when you are sick</li>
<li>Cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue, then throw the tissue in the trash</li>
<li>Clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces using a regular household cleaning spray or wipes.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>We are in regular contact with our cleaning contractors and food services staff to ensure that CDC guidelines are being followed in all areas of the University.&nbsp;</p>
<p>More information can be found on this&nbsp;coronavirus website. In particular, you may want to check out the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) on this page.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We want you all to have a great finish to the spring semester, while at the same time taking the necessary precautions to keep us all healthy and safe.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The coronavirus planning team is continuing to meet and plan for any and all eventualities and—as promised—is sharing its decisions with you as we make them. Today, we want to share procedures and processes if you find yourself feeling sick. We will continue to make decisions as this situation evolves, so it’s possible these procedures may change at a later date. We will continue to update you, and you can also check the&nbsp;<a href="/offices--departments-directory/health-services/coronavirus/">coronavirus page&nbsp;on the SHU website.</a></p>
<p>In the meantime, all of us should continue to practice the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/prevention.html?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fcoronavirus%2F2019-ncov%2Fprepare%2Fprevention.html" target="_blank">CDC hygiene guidelines.</a></p>
<h2>Students</h2>
<p>First and foremost, any students who are currently feeling sick should not come back to campus tomorrow. At a minimum, students with fever and respiratory symptom should not come back until they have been fever-free for at least 24 hours without the use of fever-reducing medications.</p>
<p>Students who start to have symptoms of the virus after their return to campus<strong>&nbsp;should not walk into Student Health Services.</strong>&nbsp;This is because we don’t want to expose others who may be there and is in keeping with <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/if-you-are-sick/steps-when-sick.html?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fcoronavirus%2F2019-ncov%2Fabout%2Fsteps-when-sick.html" target="_blank">CDC guidelines</a>.&nbsp;Instead, please call 203-371-7838 for instructions or to schedule an appointment. A phone history will be taken, and guidance will be given. It is unclear right now if Health Services will be able to test for the virus because of a shortage of available tests.</p>
<p><strong>The flu is still a bigger concern at this time</strong>.&nbsp;There was a lot of flu activity on campus just before spring break. It is not too late to get a flu shot, and there are a limited number of flu shots available at Student Health Services for $20.</p>
<h2>Faculty &amp; Staff</h2>
<p>Faculty and staff members should not be on campus if they are feeling sick.</p>
<p>Faculty members should already be developing an instructional contingency plan just in case on-ground instruction is interrupted. Any faculty member who has symptoms, but is feeling well enough to teach remotely can do so using his or her preferred method of connecting with students.</p>
<p>Staff members who feel sick should stay home and report to their supervisor. It may be possible for some staff who feel up to it to work from home. If you have any questions or concerns about the need to stay home, you should discuss them with your supervisor.</p>
<p>The<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/if-you-are-sick/steps-when-sick.html?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fcoronavirus%2F2019-ncov%2Fabout%2Fsteps-when-sick.html" target="_blank">&nbsp;CDC</a> is advising that you do not walk into a doctor’s office if you think you may have coronavirus so that you do not infect others who are there. Rather, you should call your doctor’s office for guidance. As a reminder, Aetna is providing coronavirus diagnostic testing and telemedicine visits with no out-of-pocket costs or cost sharing for Aetna members.</p>

<p>We are looking forward to seeing everyone as you arrive back on campus. We hope your break was relaxing and fun, however and wherever you spent it.</p>
<p>We are requiring all students, faculty and staff who have traveled out of the country or plan to do so to fill out our&nbsp;<a href="https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=xFmCf5HE9Uel5amfUya5dodUo2nTp_5OqhHxSi6bavdUMk1NOUdQODJPSjM3RFNWRlZRVjdQRUsxSC4u" target="_blank">international travel form</a> before returning to campus.

Going forward, as you make international travel plans, please fill out the form.</p>
<p>We are asking for this information in case the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) updates it recommendations for prevention. We will continue to monitor the recommendations of the CDC and of local health and wellness agencies.</p>
<p>All of us should continue to practice the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/prevention.html?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fcoronavirus%2F2019-ncov%2Fprepare%2Fprevention.html" target="_blank">CDC hygiene guidelines</a>.</p>
<p>Regrettably, in the wake of the coronavirus and its origins in China, there has been an increasing number of news reports regarding stereotyping, harassment and bullying directed at persons perceived to be of Chinese American or, more generally, Asian descent, including students. We know that we don’t have to worry about that at Sacred Heart, but we would be remiss if we did not remind you all that we do not tolerate any kind of ethnic harassment or bullying here.</p>
<p>We appreciate your patience and cooperation as we make day-to-day decisions based on the latest information from the CDC and local agencies. As always, the health and safety of our students, faculty and staff are our top priority. We will monitor this situation with that uppermost in our minds, and we will keep you informed as decisions are made.</p>

<p>We hope those of you who are on spring break are enjoying your time off. That said, we want to update you on what those of us on campus are doing to prepare the University to fight the coronavirus.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We have established a group of key personnel who are meeting regularly to review the situation and determine University policy and protocols. (See list below). Subgroups of the larger group are meeting daily. We already have a pandemic preparation plan in place that we will refer to and revise as appropriate. We will continue to update you as decisions are made and will also post information and guidelines on our&nbsp;<a href="/offices--departments-directory/health-services/coronavirus/">coronavirus&nbsp;webpage.</a></p>
<p>We will be consulting the advice of the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and local and state health officials as we create our own policies and procedures. Unless otherwise stated, we will follow the guidelines of the CDC. This is where we are right now:</p>
<ul>
<li>First and foremost, if you are feeling sick, we want you to stay home and see a doctor as soon as possible. If you are diagnosed with the virus, you should remain at home until the risk of transmission is gone.</li>
<li>Everyone should wash hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. Avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth with unwashed hands.</li>
<li>Clean all high-touch surfaces, such as counters, tabletops, doorknobs, phones, keyboards and toilets, at least once a day. Use a household cleaning spray or wipe according to the label instructions. The University will be asking its cleaning team to clean high-touch surfaces often.</li>
<li>If you have recently traveled to or from or been in contact with someone who has traveled to or from a CDC Level 3 or 2 country (these can be found on the CDC&nbsp;<a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/notices" target="_blank">website</a>), the CDC is recommending self-isolation for 14 days. Faculty and staff in these circumstances should discuss with their supervisor. Students should self-report to the health center. We are recommending no nonessential travel out of the country.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here are the members of the coronavirus working group:</p>
<ul>
<li>Co-chair Michael Iannazzi, chief of staff</li>
<li>Co-chair Gary MacNamara, executive director of public safety and governmental affairs</li>
<li>Jeff Barrett, risk manager</li>
<li>Jim Barquinero, senior vice president, enrollment, student affairs &amp; athletics</li>
<li>Shirley Canaan, vice president, information technology</li>
<li>David Coppola, senior vice president, administration &amp; planning</li>
<li>Rob Hardy, vice president of human resources</li>
<li>Maura Iversen, dean, College of Health Professions</li>
<li>Michael Larobina, general counsel</li>
<li>Phil McCabe, vice president for finance</li>
<li>Deb Noack, executive director of communications</li>
<li>Julie Nofri, executive director for human resources</li>
<li>Rupendra Paliwal, provost and vice president for academic affairs</li>
<li>Bill Watson, director of campus operations &amp; facilities</li>
<li>Larry Wielk, dean of students</li>
<li>Voytek Wloch, executive director, global affairs &amp; English language institute</li>
<li>Henry Yoon, medical director, clinical associate professor, Stamford</li>
</ul>
<p>I also want to caution everyone not to assume that someone who has been to or is from an affected country is more or less likely to be infected. We are all in this together, and the best way we can assure continued good health on campus is by being fastidious about following the hygiene and precautionary guidelines described above.</p>
<p>Stay tuned. As the situation evolves, we will continue to provide information protocol and policy on academic and business continuity. As always, the health and safety of our community is the top priority.</p>

<p>Over the past few weeks, we have been monitoring the news on the Coronavirus, and I want to update you on some precautions we have taken and talk about what we all should be doing to prepare for a possible outbreak here. As always, the health and safety of our students, faculty, staff and visitors is our top priority.</p>
<p>This week, we made the difficult decisions to cancel the choir’s planned trip to Rome over spring break and also to bring home the 17 students who have been studying at John Cabot University in Rome as part of our study abroad program. We have asked those students to return to the U.S. by Saturday. They have been asked to self-isolate for 14 days. They will have the choice to continue their studies with John Cabot through distance learning options either from home or here at the Fairfield campus. We have been working with those students and their families to iron out all the details surrounding their need to depart from Rome mid-semester.</p>
<p>We are also monitoring the potential impact on our students who are studying abroad in other locations, such as Luxembourg and Dingle. We are encouraging those students to limit their travel and use extreme hygiene precautions. As information becomes available, we will make the necessary decisions to keep all members of our community healthy. For now, we are asking anyone returning from an impacted area to self-isolate for 14 days before returning to campus. Anyone who has flu-like symptoms should see a doctor immediately.</p>
<p>As is usually the case with these viruses, the most vulnerable are the elderly. Communities like ours—where people live closely together—are also at risk for the rapid spread of any illness. We already have emergency plans in place and are reviewing and updating them as information becomes available. I am asking all of you to be proactive in preventing an outbreak here. Please follow the hygiene guidelines, especially frequently and thoroughly washing your hands and using sanitizer gel. If you have cold or flu symptoms, please stay home. You should also see a doctor as early as possible.</p>
<p>I want to emphasize that there is no need to panic. We are simply exercising common sense with precautionary measures to keep us all healthy. We will continue to monitor the progress of the virus and will make future decisions based on the guidelines of the CDC and other health agencies. We have created a page on our website that we will update with news about the virus and our response to it, and I am including some links to additional useful information below. We will continue to update you as this situation evolves.</p>
<p>In closing, I wish you all a wonderful spring break with your family and friends—whether you are participating in a service learning trip, traveling or heading for home. Have fun, relax and come back on March 9 rested and ready to wrap up a successful spring semester.</p>

<p>Sacred Heart University has made the difficult decision to bring home its students currently studying abroad at John Cabot University in Rome. When we considered the health and safety risks along with the possibility for quarantines and travel bans, we decided this was the most prudent course. We have asked the students to make arrangements to be back in the United States by Saturday, February 29. They will resume online classes through John Cabot—either from home or from the Fairfield campus—when spring break ends on Monday, March 9.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The University has also cancelled a planned spring break trip to Rome by the choir.</p>
