As we have prepared to share this plan with you, we have been heartened by the requests from many in our campus community to reconvene this fall in person. We have heard your hopes and aspirations to have options to return to campus or study remotely and we are confident that this plan allows us to partner with you to work toward these goals.&#160;</p><p>Over the past several months, we have convened leadership across the university, engaged with our leading medical and science experts and consulted federal, state and local health directives to develop a science- and data-based plan that works for Emory. We have made decisions on which we are confident we can deliver, including contingency plans for various scenarios, and that allow us to best serve the academic needs of our students.&#160;</p><p>Our topline decisions are as follows:</p><ul class="list-unordered"><li>We will offer both online and in-person classes this fall, allowing us to provide the excellence of an Emory education to all students.</li><li>The academic calendar will shift to start on August 19, with classes ending by Thanksgiving and exams conducted remotely.</li><li>Residence halls will be open with a standard of no more than two students per room.&#160;</li></ul><p>We want to stress that faculty, staff and students will have options for returning to campus or interacting remotely. Our goal is for everyone to feel comfortable participating in the community and to have options that reflect your preferences for continuing your education, conducting research and teaching, or serving our students. We want to provide options for you to make the best decisions and to have confidence in our planning should you decide to return in person.</p><p>While much will be different this fall, there are core elements of the Emory experience that will remain the same: We will deliver courses that meet Emory&#8217;s rigorous standards and that are taught by our world-renowned faculty, members of the academic campus community will have access to the tremendous resources of our research university, and students will be part of a community known for its support while our students are pursuing degrees with us and throughout their careers. We will deliver an equivalent Emory experience, knowing the necessity of health and safety protocols will prevent us from providing an identical experience to past years.</p><p>One lesson from the current pandemic is that plans must stay flexible to adapt to global, national and regional changes. For this reason, we ask that as you review how we envision the fall experience at this time, you also understand there may be a need for us to pivot our plan to maintain community health and preserve academic continuity. Know we have contingency plans in place should we need them.</p><h2>Fall Classes</h2><p>With faculty, student and staff health and safety as necessary considerations, the academic calendar was modified so that undergraduate classes will begin no later than August 19 and conclude by Thanksgiving, with the final evaluation period conducted remotely. The traditional schedule will be further modified by holding classes on Labor Day and eliminating fall break. Graduate and professional schools may amend this schedule slightly to meet curricular needs. (Note: The calendars for graduate, professional and select undergraduate programs may start a bit earlier or later and include different milestone dates. Please refer to your school&#8217;s website for further details.)</p><p>To maintain choices for our students, Emory will offer expanded online class options that are designed for a comprehensive remote learning experience. For our classroom environments, we will cap most in-person, large lectures to minimize class sizes and to follow physical distancing guidelines. Any rare but essential large lecture classes will be held in facilities that can accommodate appropriate physical distancing measures. It is important to note that we expect students will need to adjust their schedules to accommodate changes in course offerings and formats. Further, we expect that students&#8217; schedules will have either online courses <em>or</em> a mix of in-person and online courses, based on their preference. It may be rare for students to have entirely in-person schedules. Students will receive forthcoming emails explaining the new process and options in detail. Tuition will be applied uniformly regardless of the mix of online and in-person courses as we will provide equivalent experiences regardless of type of delivery.</p><p>We are committed to working with faculty to accommodate their preferred course format and with students to offer courses that meet their preferences and continue their progress toward graduation. Again, our efforts are focused on providing choice while maintaining our community&#8217;s health.</p><p>Please note that strict cleaning protocols for classroom spaces will be implemented. Students will be appropriately spaced in classrooms and will be required to follow protocols for entering/exiting classrooms to avoid overlap with other students.&#160; We will implement multiple measures to ensure cleanliness and safety and will communicate those to the campus community in advance of resumption of courses.</p><h2>Residence Halls</h2><p>Emory and Oxford Colleges are designed to offer residential learning opportunities that are valued by students. Therefore, we will offer on-campus housing options for the fall but will limit dorm room occupancy to two students per room. We will work with students to accommodate single room requests for those who are immunocompromised or have other health considerations. We are also expanding housing options beyond the residence halls to include Emory Conference Center Hotel for Atlanta students, and hotel options for Oxford students. Housing decisions were made after consultation with national housing experts and our own medical and health-based faculty and in accordance with multi-level health directives. As importantly, we know we have the ability, resources and expertise to implement this plan.</p><p>Similar to our planning for classroom and common spaces, we will implement enhanced cleaning protocols, and all residence hall students will be made aware of our shared responsibilities to maintain cleanliness.</p><p>For our students in our residence halls, know that this fall&#8217;s experience will be different. Students may be taking online courses from their rooms, community spaces will have new distancing and restricted occupancy expectations, and we will limit the size of gatherings&#8212;including those held in residence halls&#8212;to maintain a healthy environment.&#160;</p><p>If you are planning to reside in the residence halls this fall, please watch for an email from our housing staff that outlines move-in dates and procedures, fee schedules and policies, additional checklists and considerations, and tools to help with the transition back to campus.</p><h2>Testing, Social Norming and Expectations for Students</h2><p><strong>COVID-19 testing will be mandatory for all students living in residence halls, along with those taking in-person classes, upon or shortly before returning to campus, and will be available at any time during the semester for those who are symptomatic and for their close contacts. Faculty and staff will have access to testing on demand. </strong></p><p>Testing of symptomatic people, as well as those in close contact with people diagnosed with COVID-19, is currently underway on campus and will continue in the fall. Testing, contact tracing, isolation, quarantine, and other measures will be implemented to limit transmission of COVID-19 in our community. We cannot guarantee you will not get sick, but together we can support each other in our academic pursuits, in community and in health.</p><p>All members of the Emory community who come to campus will be required to self-monitor on a daily basis for signs of COVID-19. Trained university staff will conduct random temperature checks across campus each day. Those with fevers will be required to have a clinical evaluation and to be tested, as appropriate.</p><p>We are developing health education programs and materials to ensure community awareness and understanding of indications of illness as well as risks that lead to the spread of the disease. We will also clearly delineate what we expect from members of our community to maintain health and cleanliness standards, including face covering, distancing, cleaning protocols and general health guidance. <strong>Students <em>may not</em> opt out of community expectations for health and safety</strong>&#8212;everyone must participate for our campus community to stay healthy. Further information on testing and community awareness efforts will be sent to you in the coming weeks.</p><h2>Details Still Forthcoming</h2><p>While this letter outlines the broad strokes of what we know, decisions that have been made and health-based protocols, there are still elements we are working through based on a changing virus and world. In addition to adjusting our plan as the external environment may necessitate, we are still working through specific details that are dependent upon how many members of our campus come back in person versus online and how we can safely allow community experiences. These decisions will be based on a scientific review of information and its application to our campus needs so that we can continue to make sound decisions on behalf of our Emory community.</p><p>Additional information will be sent with specifics on social distancing and norming to best reflect growing knowledge of COVID-19 and how it is transmitted. This information will also influence policies regarding campus visitors and decisions about traditions like Family Weekend and Homecoming. Our protocols for cleaning, testing and contact tracing may need to be updated and any changes will be clearly articulated. We have heard requests to retain as much of the college experience as possible and we ask for your understanding as we implement equivalent, but not identical, experiences.</p><h2>Next Steps</h2><p>We know you will have a number of questions about your return online or in person this fall. You will receive communications from additional leaders across campus over the coming days that will provide additional specificity and resources. We apologize for any repetition, but we want all members of the community to make decisions about returning to campus that are in their best interest.</p><p>Ongoing resources will be available on the Emory website. Please bookmark the <span><a href="http://www.emory.edu/forward/index.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Emory Forward page</a></span> for questions or concerns. And please mark your calendar for a campus presentation <span><a href="https://emory.zoom.us/j/95827389617" rel="noopener" target="_blank">today at 4:30 PM</a></span> with President-elect Fenves, Interim Provost Love and Executive Vice Presidents Lewin and Augostini. They will provide further depth on the fall planning details and rationale behind the decisions. In the coming days, deans and additional campus leaders will hold town hall discussions to delineate what the fall decisions mean for their communities. We encourage you to attend and participate. These presentations will be archived on the Emory Forward site, where you can also view a <span><a href="https://vimeo.com/427734407/bea7082b3c" rel="noopener" target="_blank">video message</a></span> from President Sterk.</p><p>In addition, you will receive a survey. <strong>It is critically important that you participate in the survey </strong>as it will help us to make final decisions that need community input and to plan for your return to campus. We want your experience this fall to reflect your preferences, and this will be a critical step in our planning process.&#160;&#160;</p><p>We know that our community wants to be back together on campus and we look forward to welcoming you or introducing ourselves upon your return, too. It will be a different kind of semester, one filled with changes and choices, with new ways to connect and build relationships. But it will still be a uniquely Emory experience. Please look for additional information in the weeks to come and we welcome your feedback and questions.&#160;</p><br/><p>Sincerely,</p><p>Claire E. Sterk, President</p><p>Gregory L.

In recognition of those concerns, we are pleased to offer two voluntary programs for staff who may desire extra flexibility this summer. Please keep in mind that the needs of your work area, as Emory&#8217;s plans for the fall semester become clear, may affect your ability to participate.</p><p>The <strong>Voluntary Summer Leave Program</strong> and <strong>Voluntary Summer Reduced Hours Program</strong> allow staff members, in consultation with and subject to approval by their supervisor, to reduce their work time through the end of August. Additional details are available <a href="https://hr.emory.edu/eu/rewards/time-away/voluntary-summer-leave/index.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">here</a>, but in short, the Voluntary Summer Leave Program will allow staff to request longer periods of leave (between two and 10 weeks) while using a combination of accrued vacation days and unpaid leave. The Voluntary Summer Reduced Hours Program will allow staff to reduce either their hours worked per day or their days worked per week while accepting a commensurate &#8211; and temporary &#8211; reduction in pay.</p><p>We encourage you to review the details of these programs on the <a href="https://hr.emory.edu/eu/rewards/time-away/voluntary-summer-leave/index.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">HR website</a> and speak with your supervisor to determine if either of the volunteer programs are of interest and available to you. Regardless of whether you participate in these programs, Emory remains committed to providing a flexible work environment to support your life and family needs, to the extent we can do so, while still meeting the needs of our mission.</p><p>Thank you again for your commitment to Emory.</p><div class="clearfix"></div></div></div></td></tr><tr id="message-laney-may-29"><td class="small">

The plan begins with a return to research at lower density. Over the past month, the various schools and colleges, as well as research, academic, and administrative support units have worked very hard to prepare for the first wave of researchers to return to campus. We want to provide you with an overview of where we are.</p><p>The target date for metered, small-scale research activity to resume is&#160;<strong>May 28, 2020. Only those faculty and staff who are identified as part of the selected research efforts, as well as those who had previously been identified as essential to work on campus, will be approved to return to campus. All others should continue to work remotely. </strong>It is critical to maintain a low density of people on campus at this time to protect the health and safety of those whose work requires them to be on campus. Do not come to campus unless you have received prior approval to do so and have completed the required clearance process described below.&#160;</p><p>Over the next month, other functions and services may also be approved to return. As these plans are completed and if you are needed to return to campus, you will be notified by your supervisor and HR.&#160;</p><p>During the initial ramp up phase, visitors to campus will be prohibited, and our buildings will remain card-access only. Suspension of all university-sponsored travel will remain in effect, except as approved by the Office of the Provost for research purposes.</p><p>Emory is implementing health and safety measures to protect faculty, staff and students who will be returning to work on campus. Each of the individuals who will be working on campus has a critical role to play in keeping the campus safe.&#160;</p><h3>Health and Safety Measures</h3><p>Working with the Office of Critical Event Preparedness and Response (CEPAR), the Environmental Health and Safety Office (EHSO), the Office of Injury Management (OIM), Student Health Services (SHS), Emory Healthcare colleagues, and Emory medical and public health experts, and in compliance with state and local public health and regulatory guidance, Emory has taken a number of actions to protect the health of our community. These actions include:&#160;</p><ul class="list-unordered"><li><span></span>Development of a mandatory confidential screening questionnaire to assess the health of faculty and staff prior to their return to campus.</li><li><span></span>Implementation of mandatory physical distancing, hygiene, and face covering protocols.</li><li><span></span>Implementation of a testing and contact-tracing process with clear guidance for anyone working on campus who develops symptoms of COVID-19.</li><li><span></span>Implementation of random temperature checks.</li><li><span></span>Installation of signage to support physical distancing requirements.</li><li><span></span>Rearrangement of physical spaces, where possible, to support physical distancing.</li><li><span></span>Escalation of frequent cleaning and disinfection of all public spaces, including Emory shuttles.</li><li><span></span>Provision of supplies for cleaning, face coverings, and other necessary PPE.</li></ul><p>It is important to note that maintaining the health and safety of those working on campus is highly dependent on each of us rigorously observing the required individual behaviors. These behaviors are outlined in the <a href="https://hr.emory.edu/eu/_includes/documents/sections/covid19/return-to-campus-guidelines-faculty-staff.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><strong>Return to Campus Guidelines</strong></a>. This guide also contains helpful information about working on campus.</p><p>It is critical that those of us who are returning, and those of us who have already been working regularly on campus, follow certain steps as part of the return process. This requirement applies even if you are only working occasionally on campus. You will receive a separate communication that gives you specific instructions about this, but the required steps include:</p><ul class="list-unordered"><li><span></span>Review and acknowledge an understanding of the expectations and guidelines as you return to campus.</li><li><span></span>Complete necessary training that gives guidance about physical distancing, face covering and other PPE, hygiene, self-monitoring for symptoms, and other important health and safety aspects.</li><li><span></span>Complete a confidential health screening questionnaire online that asks about your exposure to COVID-19, contact with persons who have tested positive, travel, and symptoms.</li><li><span></span>Ensure your mobile phone number is up to date in the Emergency Notification System in PeopleSoft Self Service. If you have not enrolled in the Emergency Notification System, you will be required to do so. <strong>This is a key part of the contact tracing process.</strong></li><li><span></span>Provide a list of &#8220;close contacts&#8221; through a PeopleSoft Self Service module. <strong>This is a key part of the contact tracing process.</strong></li></ul><p>Clearly, we have a shared responsibility for implementing the practices that will support our community&#8217;s safety during the return to research at a lower density. Whether you are returning to campus or continuing to work remotely, we thank you for your commitment to Emory during these challenging times.</p><p><a href="http://www.emory.edu/coronavirus/_includes/documents/sections/messages/return-to-research-all-staff-faculty.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Attachment: Return to Research at Lower Density</a>&#160;</p><div class="clearfix"></div></div></div></td></tr><tr id="message-laney-may-22"><td class="small">

We are writing to provide updates for you on two important matters.</p><p>We know that everyone&#8217;s first question is the status of the fall semester. Answering that question is the focus of our daily work, as we plan for what we hope will be in-person instruction, albeit with many important adaptations and protections in place to prevent the spread of COVID-19 within our community. This work is guided by the <a href="https://www.emory.edu/coronavirus/emory/messages/index.html?m=message-all-principles-decision-making-april-30" rel="noopener" target="_blank">principles for decision making</a> that we discussed during last month&#8217;s town hall. While we would like to share with you a definitive decision about our status for the fall, we are simply not yet prepared to do so and likely cannot for some weeks. However, we commit to providing an update on our progress by June 15.&#160;</p><p>As was shared during last month&#8217;s town hall, we continue to assess the financial impact COVID-19 will have on the university. While we anticipate an approximately $10 million shortfall for our current fiscal year due to lost revenue related to the suspension of mission-related activities, costs related to supporting students&#8217; financial needs, faculty and staff salary continuation, and new incurred COVID-19 related costs, we do not know the full scope of loss for the upcoming fiscal year. As we approach the traditional beginning of the fall semester, we expect a clearer financial picture, but we should not wait any longer to implement additional financial measures that will help mitigate additional losses.&#160;</p><p>In keeping with our decision-making principles, noted above, we are writing today to share the first of what will be several actions in the coming months. <strong>Effective July 1, President Sterk, the President&#8217;s Leadership Team and the deans will reduce their compensation by 15 percent.</strong> This reduction, which will be subject to review at the end of calendar year 2020, is not just a cost-savings step, but also a representation of the commitment the leadership team has to preserving Emory&#8217;s academic and research missions in the face of financial challenges.&#160;</p><p>Thank you for your continued resilience during these uncertain times and for your patience as we thoughtfully and systematically work through many decisions for our Emory community to continue to move forward this Fall.</p><br/><p>Sincerely,&#160;</p><p>Claire E.

This communication is to let you know that <strong>beginning immediately</strong>, Emory University will commence a multi-phased plan to gradually return to campus for research. As described below, the first phase involves planning at the levels of schools and colleges as well as research support units. Safely resuming additional on-campus and community-based research activities is crucial to our mission to create, preserve, teach, and apply knowledge in the service of humanity. What we learn will inform our decisions about how and when to return to campus for other activities, including teaching and learning.</p><p>Our priority is to protect the health and safety of all members of our community and campus visitors. Our overarching and long-range goals include a return to on-campus, clinical and community-based research, teaching, and learning as soon as it is safe to do so.</p><p>To be clear, <u>our campus is presently a safe place</u>, but higher levels of activity will require implementation of a variety of public health measures that necessitate careful planning and monitoring. We will use all available public health data and guidance as well as data relating specifically to the health and safety of the Emory community to inform decisions and make any necessary updates or adjustments to this plan. <strong>This means that our plans may change. </strong>Circumstances may require us to adjust timelines, change venues, and shift the format of our planned activities, but our priorities, commitments, and values will be unwavering: we <u>will</u> deliver extraordinary educational and research outcomes while implementing the highest standards of care for the well-being of our community.</p><p>The following plan outlines how we will do this <em>together</em>. In making this announcement, we want to underscore what this togetherness entails&#8212;we have a shared responsibility for implementing the practices that will support our collective success.</p><h2>Activities to be supported</h2><p>The return to campus to support research in all its forms&#8212;physical laboratory and non-laboratory (clinical and epidemiological), funded and non-funded, humanistic, creative, and social scientific, as well as libraries and core facilities, and offices both local and global&#8212;must be done gradually and pragmatically based on the best medical, scientific, and public health evidence. It should also be informed by our institutional commitments to support and maintain progress for students and trainees, and to diversity, equity, and inclusion as we make decisions that necessitate prioritization and the exercise of authority and oversight. Re-engagement of research and scholarly activities must also comply with all federal, state, and local laws and regulations and requirements of our accrediting bodies. The larger principles for decision-making that are informing the university return to campus research activity will also guide this effort.&#160;</p><p>Importantly, the COVID-19 pandemic remains dynamic. <strong>All steps in this process are subject to legal and public health contingencies</strong>, such as new governmental restrictions or other public health measures that emerge in response to a resurgence. To support effective communication, necessary collaboration, and clear designation of responsibilities, a return to campus calendar is detailed in the <a href="http://www.emory.edu/coronavirus/emory/research-return/index.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Return to Campus for Research Framework documents</a>, and will be updated and maintained on the university website. Implementation dates and procedures may need to be adapted to fit community- and public health-circumstances. Thus, activities should be resumed with <strong>resilience strategies</strong> in mind to minimize set-backs in the event of revisions to the calendar or process.&#160;</p><p>Resumption of campus- and community-based research activity will be linked with a systematic approach to detecting and controlling the spread of infection in the Emory community. Human Resources (HR) will provide a process to support those with underlying conditions or living situations that put them at greater risk for infection or severe complications from the disease. Those working in clinical partner sites should follow the instructions and requirements for the specific facilities:</p><ul class="list-unordered"><li><a href="http://www.ourehc.org/departments/communicable-diseases/coronavirus.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Emory Healthcare (Login Required)</a></li><li><a href="https://inside.med.emory.edu/administration/grady/about/covid-19.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Grady Health System (Login Required)</a></li><li><a href="https://dvagov.sharepoint.com/sites/atlanta/program/em/SitePages/Home.aspx" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Atlanta VA Health System</a></li><li><a href="https://www.choa.org/covid19forphysicians" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Children&#8217;s Healthcare of Atlanta</a></li></ul><h2>Key strategies</h2><p>A robust practice of health monitoring and testing will be combined with public health guidance for mitigating risk. Data will inform real-time assessment of whether and when to advance in the staged recovery efforts.</p><h2>Phases</h2><p>Progress through phases will be determined by the Office of the Provost in consultation with the Executive Vice President for Health Affairs. Decisions about changes in phases will take into account guidance and data from the CDC and from local public health authorities.</p><p><strong>Phase 1: Preliminary Planning &amp; Assessment of Readiness </strong>(Immediately-May 27)</p><p>Phase 1 involves a review of guidance by the Office of the Provost in the <a href="http://www.emory.edu/coronavirus/emory/research-return/index.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Return to Campus for Research Framework</a>. The various schools and colleges as well as research and academic support units on campus are tasked with preparing unit-specific planning documents to <u>identify faculty, staff and postdoctoral fellows and trainees</u> who will participate in increased activity necessary for the support of research on campus. Among the plans to be developed are those providing for the limited reopening of critical research facilities such as research cores, libraries, the museum, and laboratories.</p><p>While we implement Phase 1, <strong>all faculty and staff who are able to work remotely should continue to do so unless otherwise instructed by their dean, department or program director, or supervisor</strong>. Visitors to campus are prohibited, and our buildings will remain card-access only. Additionally, the suspension of all university-sponsored travel remains in effect.</p><p><strong>Phase 2: </strong><strong>Metered Small-Scale Restart </strong>(May 28-June 21)</p><p>Based on what we learn from Phase 1 and our assessments of operational readiness, we will work to carefully bring back additional personnel to increase capacity and functionality as needed to support core academic operations and related student services. The target date for commencement of this phase is <strong>May 28, 2020</strong>. During this phase, we expect to include, once approved, postdoctoral fellows and trainees as well as graduate students in return to research-related campus activities. <strong>Once again, it will be important for all faculty and staff who are able to work remotely to continue to do so unless otherwise instructed by their dean, department or program director, or supervisor.</strong> It is expected that during this phase, visitors to campus will continue to be prohibited, and our buildings will remain card-access only. Suspension of all university-sponsored travel is expected to remain in effect. The data we collect as part of Phases 1 and 2 will inform our assessments of both the health and safety of the community and our institutional operational capacity to support greater numbers of students, faculty, and staff on campus. What we learn from these two phases will make us more resilient and capable in the months ahead.</p><p><strong>Phase 3: Expansion of Activity </strong>(June 22-date to be determined)</p><p>On or about <strong>June 22, 2020</strong>, we are planning for a <u>metered and monitored</u> re-opening of broader on-campus research activities aligned with university guidelines to maintain a sustainable total population density on campus. Local population densities monitored by local unit leaders, in collaboration as required for shared-use facilities, including:</p><ul class="list-unordered"><li>Faculty (per guidelines from dean/director/chair);</li><li>Staff <u>required</u> on campus to perform their duties;</li><li>Postdocs and related trainees; and</li><li>Graduate and professional students (per guidelines from the Laney Graduate School and relevant dean).</li></ul><p>Once again, <strong>it will be important for all faculty and staff who are able to work remotely to continue to do so unless otherwise instructed by their dean, department or program director, or supervisor. </strong>It is expected that during this phase, visitors to campus will continue to be restricted, and our buildings will remain card-access only. <strong>At this time, we will revisit suspension of university-sponsored travel.</strong></p><p>The Return to Campus for Research Framework was developed through a collaborative and highly consultative process arising from the activities of the Faculty and Research Academic Continuity Group led by Vice Provost for Faculty Affairs Tim Holbrook, and Vice Provost for Strategic Research Initiatives Lanny Liebeskind. We are deeply grateful for their leadership and for the contributions of many others who participated in the planning activities.&#160;</p><p>We will continue to communicate decisions, updates and next steps once available, and thank you for your help in bringing Emory together again.</p><p>Sincerely,</p><p>Jan Love, Interim Provost and Executive Vice President for Academic Affairs&#160;</p><p>Jon Lewin, Executive Vice President for Health Affairs</p><div class="clearfix"></div></div></div></td></tr><tr id="message-all-celebrating-staff-may-13"><td class="small">

For demonstrating the resolve and perseverance needed to make this happen, we thank you.</p><p>Beyond recognizing the considerable achievements of our students, Emory&#8217;s Commencement exercises have also traditionally offered a public forum to honor faculty and staff members with the presentation of university awards for exceptional teaching, leadership, citizenship and distinguished service.</p><p>In the coming days, you will learn more about these <strong>major university awards</strong> and about the inspirational individuals who will be receiving them this year.&#160;</p><p>These awards represent some of the most prestigious honors bestowed by the university. For students, they include the Marion Luther Brittain Award, Emory&#8217;s highest student honor, and the Lucius Lamar McMullan Award. For faculty and staff, university honors include the Thomas Jefferson Award, the Exemplary Teacher Award, the Emory Williams Teaching Award, the Provost&#8217;s Distinguished Teaching Award and the George P.

They affirm our commitments to compassion, honesty, respect and concern for the greater good, which are rooted within Emory&#8217;s long-standing values.</p><p>The principles include:&#160;</p><ul class="list-unordered"><li>Emory will continue to vigorously pursue our mission to create, preserve, teach and apply knowledge in the service of humanity.</li><li>The health and safety of Emory&#8217;s students, faculty and staff is paramount in moving forward into recovery. We will make decisions based on the best medical, scientific and public health evidence and will be compliant with all federal, state and local laws and regulations and requirements of our accrediting bodies.</li><li>Emory will continue to provide excellent academic offerings, ensure student progress and protect our students&#8217; ability to afford to attend Emory.</li><li>The ability of faculty, staff and students to conduct research and engage in scholarship will be fully supported. Interrupted and suspended activities will resume as soon as it is safe to do so.</li><li>Decisions will be reached in the context of shared governance and through processes that are transparent and collaborative. They will be supported by the best available data and draw upon the considerable expertise and intellectual capital of the university.</li><li>Decisions will allow for flexibility to respond to rapid and perhaps unanticipated changes in circumstances.</li><li>Financial well-being will be assessed with respect to the short-, medium- and long-term impacts on our community <em>and </em>Emory&#8217;s financial health.</li><li>Cost reductions through efficiencies and discretionary spending will be prioritized so as to minimize the impact on employment or compensation of our employees. If reductions affecting employment or compensation become necessary, they will be done in a fair and equitable manner that protects the most vulnerable (lowest paid) populations to the greatest extent possible.</li><li>We will communicate the basis and rationale for decisions to our community.</li></ul><p>While we have been called to make many decisions during this pandemic, one pending decision is the plan for reopening campus this fall. To that end, we assembled a Recovery Implementation Team that is using the principles above to outline solutions for a safe return to campus.</p><p>This process includes a thoughtful review of important elements, including availability for COVID-19 testing, contact tracing procedures, isolation of COVID-19 positive individuals, plans to maximize social distancing and protection for the most vulnerable or for those who could be disproportionately impacted on campus. We will need to have procedures in place to continue physical distancing, oversee cleaning processes, establish universal face covering protocols and adhere to infection prevention strategies to maintain the health and safety of the Emory community.&#160;&#160;</p><p>Our planning scenarios outline options for both in-person and remote learning modules as well as a combination of the two and are designed to dynamically adapt to public health guidelines and safety recommendations. However, there are still many variables to be considered for a fall reopening and many questions that need to be answered before we can release a definitive plan. We will communicate a decision and share what this means for the Emory community once important information is collected and analyzed, and a plan is developed for our community.&#160;</p><p>While we thank you for your patience and understanding during this time, we also charge the entire Emory community &#8212; faculty, staff and students &#8212; to be imaginative and innovative as we work on creative and flexible solutions to meet our collective needs. It is certainly in Emory&#8217;s nature to be optimistic, and it is through interdisciplinary thought and courageous action that we can keep our community safe and healthy.&#160;</p><br/><p>Sincerely,</p><p>Jan Love, Interim Provost and Executive Vice President for Academic Affairs</p><p>Christopher L.

But for everyone, this year has posed challenges unlike anything we&#8217;ve ever before experienced, as our spring semester was disrupted by a global pandemic.</p><p>We want to acknowledge the remarkable resilience demonstrated by students, faculty and staff in adapting to significant changes, including an abrupt transition to online education.&#160;</p><p>Our students had to adjust to a new way of learning in a very different environment.

Students may be feeling anxious about online tests or studying under stressful conditions at home without the convenience and reassurances of in-person study groups. They may be missing friends or finding it hard to concentrate and stay motivated. Meanwhile, faculty and staff are balancing their Emory-related responsibilities with additional demands at home as they care for family members and, in many cases, invest considerable time in their own children&#8217;s remote learning. We&#8217;re all juggling a lot and experiencing increased stress and anxiety.</p><p>There are people and services here to help you make it through what has, for everyone, been an incredibly difficult time.&#160;</p><p>If you are a student feeling stressed and unmotivated, please don&#8217;t hesitate to reach out to faculty members or academic advisors to answer questions, to better understand your academic support options.

Many of us have become newly acquainted with public health terminology, and extraordinary measures such as quarantine, stay-at-home orders, and physical distancing have clarified just how interconnected our lives &#8212; and our health &#8212; really are. Many of us have also experienced uncertainty the likes of which we might never have imagined. We all want to know<span>&#160;</span><em>how</em><span>&#160;</span>and<span>&#160;</span><em>when</em><span>&#160;</span>it will end, and we all want to bring a semblance of order, predictability and regularity to our lives.<span>&#160;</span></p><p>Since early February, the Office of the Provost, working with colleagues throughout the university, has been laser-focused on the spread of COVID-19, its impacts on our community, and the forms of support our students, faculty, and staff need as we do our part to respond and seek to flatten the curve.</p><p>This required many decisions and rapid actions, including:</p><ul class="list-unordered"><li>Implementing remote learning for 4,239 classes taught by 1,662 professors;</li><li>Supporting thousands of employees in transitioning to remote working;</li><li>Developing a pandemic mitigation plan that resulted in ramping down and redirecting all but critical activities in our nearly $690 million research operation;</li><li>Recalling more than 150 undergraduate students from study abroad;</li><li>Helping 4,100 students move out of the residence halls;</li><li>Accommodating and relocating more than 300 students, including 49 from our Oxford campus, who were unable to return home before the end of the semester to the Clairmont campus;</li><li>Issuing student credits for housing, dining, and fees totaling nearly $14 million;</li><li>Providing students with lump sum payments of nearly $400,000 for federal work study, and paying non-federal work-study student employees $1,075,197 for anticipated on campus work contributions;</li><li>Providing $1.55 million in cash stipends to undergraduate students with the greatest financial need;</li><li>Disbursing $2.2 million to graduate and undergraduate students through the<span>&#160;</span><span>EmoryTogether</span><span>&#160;</span>fund, processing more than 6,000 requests for aid; and we expect to process another 1,000 applications for assistance;</li><li>Creating a<span>&#160;</span><a href="https://emory.sharepoint.com/sites/DUC" rel="noopener" target="_blank">virtual community hub</a><span>&#160;</span>to pull together ways that students can connect online with old friends, make new friends and take care of themselves and others;</li><li>Treating more than 700 student patients in student health services, and preparing a secondary facility in the event of a surge in illness;</li><li>Adapting grading policies for students, and extending the tenure clocks for faculty;</li><li>Combatting health stigmatization and racism by reaffirming and communicating our core values;</li><li>Aligning academic affairs, health sciences, and business administration to effectively manage our resources with the greatest of care so that we can be in the strongest possible position for the fall.&#160; &#160;&#160;&#160;</li></ul><p>Alongside all this activity, we have been planning for the future by drawing on the expertise of our world-renown and pioneering faculty in public health. We are assessing the capacities of our extraordinary health care system, learning from our peers, and consulting our partners at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the CDC.<span>&#160;</span></p><p>The outstanding question on the minds of all of us at Emory<span>&#160;</span><em>is what will happen in the fall?</em><span>&#160;</span>We don&#8217;t have a decision for you just yet. However, we do want you to know that we are working on a plan for the coming academic year, and we thought you might appreciate more insight into the process and framework we&#8217;re using to reach decisions.<span>&#160;</span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</p><p>The health and safety of our students, faculty, and staff is paramount. And we&#8217;ll settle for nothing less than excellence in the arenas of teaching and learning. Colleagues from across the university have been meeting in teams with leaders from each and every school and college, including Campus Life, Campus Services, Occupational Safety, Research Administration, Student Health, General Counsel, Communications and Public Affairs, Business Affairs, Enrollment Services, Admissions, Financial Aid, the Registrar&#8217;s Office, and Procurement to tackle problems and rapidly identify possible solutions.<span>&#160;</span>&#160;</p><p>Together with<span>&#160;</span><a href="https://emergency.emory.edu/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">CEPAR</a>, we are drawing on all of these insights and operational expertise to develop a plan that will allow us to deliver on our academic mission, maintain standards, support path-breaking research, and advance the priorities of the university.<span>&#160;</span>&#160;</p><p>All of us want to be together again to study and learn, explore and share just as soon as it safe for us to do so. We all want a return to life on campus, to classrooms and residence halls, libraries and labs, and clinical placements.<span>&#160;</span><em>When</em><span>&#160;</span>might we do so?<span>&#160;</span><em>How</em><span>&#160;</span>can we best support a healthy campus? These are among the many factors we are integrating in our planning.<span>&#160;</span>&#160;</p><p>As we do this work, we&#8217;re inspired by the creativity, commitment, and resolve of our community. We<span>&#160;</span><strong><em>will</em></strong><span>&#160;</span>get through this together. Moreover, we are confident that &#8212; because of the efforts of so many &#8212; we are building an Emory that is even more capable and adaptive to change. That resilience will serve us well in both the short- and the long-term.<span>&#160;</span>&#160;</p><p>Thank you for your patience as we explore what&#8217;s possible. Our resolve remains to &#8220;create, preserve, teach, and apply knowledge in the service of humanity.&#8221; And that mission matters now more than ever.&#160;&#160;<span>&#160;</span></p><p>Sincerely,<span>&#160;</span></p><p>Christa<span>&#160;</span><span>Acampora</span>, Deputy Provost for Academic Affairs</p><p><span>Enku</span><span>&#160;</span><span>Gelaye</span>, Vice President and Dean of Campus Life</p><p class=" inline-styles text-center">Please visit the<span>&#160;</span><a href="http://www.emory.edu/coronavirus/emory/faq/academic-continuity.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Academic Continuity page</a><span>&#160;</span>on<span>&#160;</span><a href="https://www.emory.edu/coronavirus/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Emory&#8217;s Coronavirus website</a><span>&#160;</span>for additional information.</p><div class="clearfix"></div></div></div></td></tr><tr id="message-laney-student-updates"><td class="small">

I appreciate your patience as we adjust to the new reality and continue to comply with public health guidance.</p><p>We recognize that the changes have been disruptive, and we understand there are concerns about how this crisis will impact your plans. We are working closely with your program faculty to address immediate needs and emerging challenges. Together, we are committed to providing flexibilities and resources to best support you during this time. Please be assured that we are working on ways to move forward as we navigate these uncertain times with you.&#160;</p><h2>Town Halls &amp; Virtual Forums</h2><p>In addition to the ongoing LGS virtual sessions, many programs have organized virtual forums to learn more about your questions and concerns. The feedback you have provided has been instrumental during this transition. In addition to the upcoming university-wide town hall, LGS will host virtual conversations with students after the spring term ends.<strong>&#160;</strong></p><h2>Academic Progress</h2><p>We have asked programs to be as flexible as possible regarding degree requirements, such as qualifying exams and defenses. LGS will also offer flexibilities for policies and deadlines related to leave of absence, candidacy, and degree completion.</p><p>We understand that restricted access to laboratories, libraries, museums, fieldwork sites, and other research resources will delay progress for many students. We also recognize that these issues are complex and that it may take time both to assess obstacles and to adapt plans. We are working with Directors of Graduate Studies and Program Directors to address these needs.</p><h2>Financial Support</h2><p>We know that you are concerned about funding support. We remain steadfast in fulfilling our commitments in the form of stipends, admissions fellowships, tuition scholarships, health insurance subsidies, back-up care, PDS funds, awards, and advanced fellowships. If you have immediate needs related to your individual funding situation, please let your advisor and Director of Graduate Studies/Program Director know as soon as possible.</p><p>For the summer 2020 term, LGS students will not be responsible for paying student fees (Enrollment, Computing, Mental Health, Athletics, and Activity Fees).

We understand and share in your sense of loss not only for the formal Commencement festivities, but also for the very personal farewell and &#8220;thank you&#8221; moments with friends, faculty, mentors, and staff. While these in-person moments will have to wait for another day, we are eager to join your family and friends in celebrating the extraordinary accomplishments of your class in May.</span></p><p><span>Over the past few weeks, a Commencement Task Force has gathered invaluable ideas and input from students, faculty, staff, and alumni. Students specifically &#8212; both undergraduate and graduate &#8212; were integral in guiding the final decisions and shared valuable feedback regarding key aspects of the traditional event they hold most dear. The goal was to create meaningful experiences that honor some of our beloved Commencement traditions and invite your voices to be part of the celebration in a way that can be preserved and cherished for years to come. </span></p><p><span>In addition to the individual school events, a new interactive website will launch on May 4, to allow the entire community &#8212; family, friends, faculty members, staff, alumni and students &#8212; to honor graduates through uploaded messages, photos, and videos celebrating both your time within the Emory community and your induction as our newest alumni class. One website example is the &#8220;Y/our Moment,&#8221; a short film that helps tell the story of the Class of 2020 from your perspective and that of your faculty. These videos, along with many other ceremonial and celebratory pieces, will be featured on the website and shareable with your network of friends and family.</span></p><p><span>We hope that you will take the time to engage in these interactive opportunities and add your personal thoughts and memories. Throughout the week of May 4, several other events will be featured on the site including Class Day and Baccalaureate presentations. Oxford College and several of Emory&#8217;s schools will host unique live and recorded award presentations and ceremonies, all leading up to the special events on May 11 when your degrees will be conferred (Oxford will be conferred on May 9). One special opportunity on that day will be an interactive address from our 2020 Commencement speaker, <a href="https://eji.org/bryan-stevenson/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Bryan Stevenson</a>, acclaimed human rights lawyer, activist, founder, and executive director of the Montgomery, Alabama-based Equal Justice Initiative.</span></p><p><span>Rest assured, Emory plans to invite graduates from the class of 2020 back to campus to gather, celebrate, and be recognized with family and friends. In today&#8217;s uncertain environment, we do not know the date that may be possible or exactly what the Commencement celebrations will look like &#8212;but we are committed to figuring out a path forward with you, Class of 2020. We know how important this is to so many of you and acknowledge the challenges that segments of the class may face in attending a future event on campus. The feedback of student representatives has been a critical part of the Commencement planning process and will remain so as we plan for these celebrations.</span></p><p><span>In the meantime, we hope that these special Commencement activities, both university-wide and from your schools, will provide a real sense of completion and acknowledgement of a job well done under extraordinary circumstances. You&#8217;ve earned it, and we cannot wait to share in these experiences with you. We applaud your accomplishments, and look forward to joining you online soon, and in-person very soon.</span></p><br/><p><span>Sincerely,</span></p><p><span>Claire E.

It&#8217;s within those moments that we find individuals who support the greater good. While examples of such service can be found in every corner of our campus and health care communities, we particularly want to acknowledge the creativity, patience and determination that have been demonstrated by our Emory students.</p><p>Graduate and undergraduate students at Emory&#8217;s Atlanta and Oxford College campuses have worked with other graduate and undergraduate students, staff, faculty and administrators to create new systems and portals and to identify resources that have helped make our new model work.</p><p>Even amid the disruptions of packing to leave campus and adjust to remote learning, Emory students helped one another. During last month&#8217;s move-out, the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/EmoryUniversitySGA/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Emory Student Government Association</a> (SGA) quickly arranged free MARTA passes to help with transportation needs and collected and shared student concerns about remote learning. At the same time, the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/emorycollegecouncil/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Emory College Council</a> shifted to public online meetings and produced COVID-19-specific resources.&#160;</p><p>The <a href="https://www.facebook.com/EmoryGSGA/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Emory Graduate Student Government Association</a> (GSGA) has provided a range of resources, including sharing virtual fitness, health and wellness activities via social media; hosting a weekly online &#8220;Quarantine Quiz Show;&#8221; and facilitating discussions about ways to create and maintain a sense of community online. GSGA has maintained open lines of communication with each division to keep abreast of the remote student experience and related needs.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.facebook.com/emoryoxfordsga/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Oxford SGA</a> also played a driving role in providing support and secured free boxes for students who returned to campus to pack up their rooms, while Oxford student residence life staff offered hands-on help to pack belongings for the transition to remote learning. Using social media, the Oxford SGA also launched a spotlight series to illustrate how students are managing the call for physical distancing.</p><p>And as everyone has settled into a new online learning, graduate and undergraduate governance on both campuses opened new avenues for student involvement, moving governance meetings online, hosting virtual town halls and providing digital voting options for this month&#8217;s regularly scheduled elections.</p><p>When students choose Emory, we know that they bring with them exceptional qualities, including leadership skills, creative minds, a desire to serve others, and an appreciation for the rewards that come from hard work.</p><p>During these challenging times, it has been inspiring to see these skills applied to the larger good. From a grateful community, please know that your investments in supporting Emory are both acknowledged and deeply appreciated.</p><br/><p>Sincerely,&#160;</p><p>Jan Love, Interim Provost and Executive Vice President for Academic Affairs</p><p>Christopher L.

As we approach the end of the academic year, I wanted to provide you with updates on two important decisions so that you can plan accordingly for both summer and fall semesters. The health and safety of our students, faculty and staff remain our top priority and guide our decision-making process.&#160;</p><p><strong><u>First, an update on summer academic programming at Emory</u></strong>:<span>&#160;</span><strong>To protect public health and minimize risks for disruption, Emory University will offer only summer programming that can be completed off-campus and in remote learning formats.</strong><span>&#160;</span>Information about online programming for the summer is available through your school registrar and on the<span>&#160;</span><a href="https://atlas.emory.edu/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Course Atlas website</a>. Many of Emory&#8217;s summer offerings were specifically designed for online learning and are routinely offered in that format. If you were considering enrolling in summer courses, I encourage you to review these offerings, connect with your advisor if necessary, and complete your summer registration by the deadline established by your school or program.<span>&#160;</span>&#160;</p><p>As&#160;<a href="https://news.emory.edu/stories/2020/03/coronavirus_remote_learning/campus.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">previously announced</a>, residential learning has been suspended for the remainder of the semester. Emory transitioned to remote learning for graduate and undergraduate classes on Monday, March 23. All university-sponsored events and gatherings of any size are indefinitely suspended.</p><p>All university events and gatherings, both on and off campus, should shift to virtual venues or be postponed. If essential, brief meetings may be held in spaces large enough to accommodate appropriate social distancing.&#160;</p><p>Also, Emory made the difficult but necessary decision to&#160;<a href="https://www.emory.edu/coronavirus/emory/messages/index.html?m=message-all-spring-commencement-march-18" rel="noopener" target="_blank">cancel Commencement exercises</a> planned for May. We realize that this is enormously disappointing, but this was the one option that ensures the safety and well-being of our Emory community members in the face of the spread of COVID-19. Planning is already underway to celebrate and commemorate the Class of 2020 later in the year, once we are able to do so safely. More information will be shared as these plans proceed.<span>&#160;</span></p><p><strong><u>Second, an update on the status of undergraduate study abroad programs for fall 2020</u>: University-sponsored study abroad for undergraduate students in fall 2020 is canceled.</strong><span>&#160;</span>We have made this difficult and disappointing decision based on the health and safety concerns associated with global and domestic travel and the uncertainty of conditions in various countries abroad. These considerations are also combined with concerns about the stability and resilience of the sponsoring organizations responsible for providing a quality experience that would allow students to achieve their academic and personal goals.&#160;</p><p>For those of you who were planning on a study abroad experience this fall, I know this is difficult news to hear. While the uncertainty surrounding COVID-19 makes planning for fall difficult, know that as we work to provide a year of rich learning experiences for students during the 2020-21 academic year, we will strive to create new and unique travel and study opportunities for students.</p><p>I remain profoundly impressed by the resilience, patience and understanding shown by the Emory community as we all adjust to the many changes being forced upon us by COVID-19. I thank you all for your continued commitment to the life and work of the university, even at a distance, and wish you and your loved ones continued health and safety.&#160;</p><br/><p>Sincerely,</p><p>Jan Love</p><p>Interim Provost and Executive Vice President for Academic Affairs</p><div class="clearfix"></div></div></div></td></tr><tr id="message-all-caps-april-8"><td class="small">

As our community has shifted to distance learning and remote work in many areas, and the rate of cases in Georgia rapidly increases, it has become clear that it will be difficult for Emory to maintain an accurate count of members of our community who are diagnosed as positive for COVID-19. For this reason, we have revised our approach to reporting confirmed cases and will no longer send announcements about illnesses on campus.&#160;For the most accurate and up-to-date information <strong>about COVID-19 in Georgia or Metro Atlanta</strong>, please refer to the <a href="https://dph.georgia.gov/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Georgia Department of Health</a> and the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a> for COVID-19 tracking. Our commitment to the health and safety of our community is unwavering as we continue to work closely with local and state health partners to monitor and manage COVID-19 and address its impact on our community.</p><p>Leadership in Academic Affairs and Business Administration is currently working with schools and units to define essential activities on campus and provide guidance to both faculty and staff. We will focus our attention on around-the-clock actions to protect students, faculty, and staff who remain&#160;on campus. If your function is deemed essential and you are required to come to campus but feel you are in a high-risk group due to your age or a medical condition, please talk to your supervisor or HR representative for working options.</p><h2>In the event of illness</h2><ul class="list-unordered"><li><strong>If you are a student who has relocated out of Atlanta</strong>, and have become symptomatic (<em>fever &gt;100F, cough, shortness of breath, sore throat</em>), call your primary care provider.</li><li><strong>If you are a student on campus or in the Atlanta area</strong>, please access the <a href="http://studenthealth.emory.edu/hs/about/patient_portal.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Student Health Patient Portal</a>, message the &#8220;COVID Assessment Provider,&#8221; and notify Student Health Services. If you are having chest pain, serious difficulty breathing or any other type of medical emergency, call 911.&#160;</li><li><strong>For students who are symptomatic</strong>, please inform your professors if your illness will impact your studies.</li><li><strong>If you are faculty or staff, and become symptomatic </strong>(<em>fever &gt;100F, cough, shortness of breath, sore throat</em>) go home immediately, contact your health provider, and do not return to work. If you are ill and unable to work, contact your supervisor, program director, department chairperson, or dean&#8217;s office. So that we may understand critical workforce needs, it is very important for you to indicate your use of sick leave in the Exempt Leave Tracking or Time and Attendance System. After illness, the <a href="https://www.hr.emory.edu/eu/wellness/general-health/occupational-injury-management/index.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Office of Injury Management (OIM)</a> can help assess an employee&#8217;s readiness to return to work.</li><li><strong>If you are faculty or staff and concerned you have been exposed</strong> to someone with COVID-19, call the Emory Healthcare hotline: <a href="tel:404-712-6843">404-71-COVID</a> (<a href="tel:404-712-6843">404-712-6843</a>), where you can be connected with a nurse for guidance. If you are asymptomatic, you may be able to continue to work and should self-monitor for symptoms.&#160;</li></ul><p>Everyone can do their part to keep themselves and their friends and families safe by practicing social distancing both inside and outside.

We will count on alumni to support students now and in the future, demonstrating the strength of the Emory family.&#160;</p><p>We are committed too, to supporting you all as you navigate an unprecedented situation for your lives, careers, and families. Emory is far more than beautiful buildings set on the Quad. We have seen your acts of kindness, your leadership in your communities, and the care that you bring.&#160;</p><p>We will stay in touch regarding the ways that we will build strength for Emory together through this crisis, and we are grateful for the many ways you have already demonstrated your support.&#160;</p><p>Gratefully,</p><p><strong>Dean Michael A.

Starting March 27, students can make the following changes outlined below. Students are encouraged to schedule an advising appointment through <a href="https://mx.technolutions.net/mps2/c/2wA/jM0HAA/t.30b/8Dhhq9-jS4GnR2eyGU7NHg/h2/8fsOvEJjhjNkXgxawSMH4Vq0QmY0Finq-2FeF2Kl3ILwk-3D/akQ7" rel="noopener" target="_blank">College Connect</a> or ask questions via email to <a href="mailto:oue.advising@emory.edu">oue.advising@emory.edu</a>&#160;or <a href="mailto:prehealth@emory.edu">prehealth@emory.edu</a>.

Taking a course withdrawal may delay progress to graduation. This is particularly important for courses required as a GER or for a major/minor. It may also impact progress if they withdraw from a course that is a pre-requisite for another course.<br/><em>The option will remain available until 5 p.m., Friday, April 10.</em></li><li>Option 3: Request an Incomplete<br/>Taking an incomplete in a course means that the student and the faculty member of the course have made arrangements to complete the requirements of the course at a later period of time, typically in the immediate next semester. Once the requirements are completed, the incomplete grade will be changed to the earned grade.<br/><em>This option will remain available until the last day of classes this semester.</em></li></ul><p>Study Abroad: Returning Study Abroad students must contact the Study Abroad office (<a href="mailto:studyabroad@emory.edu">studyabroad@emory.edu</a>) with requests for academic action.</p><h2>Remote IT and Classroom Tech Support</h2><p>College IT and Classroom Tech are in service and ready to support faculty and staff.</p><p>We will be monitoring our tickets 7 days a week from 7 a.m. to 10 p.m. and will respond to emergency requests as soon as possible.

You will have access to the new program by the end of the month.</p><p>Faculty 180 is a system that allows faculty to enter all professional activities in one system that can then be used to generate CVs, reporting, biosketches, etc.</p><p>This platform will provide Emory-wide uniformity for university reporting that supports faculty, administrative, and accreditation needs. This easy-to-use system will streamline data collection for your use as well as for reporting purposes in Emory College, and Emory University. Faculty 180 is a powerful tool to capture the totality of faculty activity. For this year, our goal is to capture only the past year&#8217;s activity for the purposes of annual review.</p><p>This Year&#8217;s Faculty Activity Report for Performance Review: This spring all tenure-track and lecturer-track faculty will enter their activity information encompassing the past year (May 2019 &#8211; May 2020) in Faculty 180 instead of through OFARs. Activity information will need to be entered and complete by all regular faculty by Friday, May 15, 2020.</p><p>Faculty 180 Training Sessions: Your department chair may have already arranged for a department specific session but there are also general training sessions available through Zoom. They are scheduled:</p><ul class="list-unordered"><li>2 &#8211; 4 p.m., Wednesday, April 1</li><li>8:30 &#8211; 10:30 a.m., Tuesday, April 14</li><li>2 &#8211; 4 p.m., Monday, April 20</li></ul><p>These sessions will be posted on the Dean of Faculty Outlook calendar so faculty can go there to claim the session link(s). You may also RSVP to the <a href="mailto:Dean_of_Faculty@emory.edu">Dean_of_Faculty@emory.edu</a>&#160;email and we will send you a calendar invite with the Zoom link information.</p><h3>Heilbrun Distinguished Emeritus Fellows Program</h3><p>This marks the 20th year of competition for the Heilbrun Distinguished Emeritus Fellowship. The program will support two fellowships in the amount of $10,000 each for the 2020-2021 academic year. Any faculty who have not previously received this award and have achieved emeritus status on or before September 1, 2020, are eligible to apply.</p><p>The criteria for selection will include:</p><ul class="list-unordered"><li>The relationship of the proposed project to the candidate's previous research.</li><li>The feasibility of completing the project within the term of the Fellowship.</li><li>The overall value of the research to the applicant's field or discipline.</li></ul><p>Fellowship recipients will be asked to agree to the following conditions:</p><ul class="list-unordered"><li>Submission of a written report to the Committee upon completion of the Fellowship.</li><li>Formal acknowledgment of Fellowship support in any published work that results</li><li>Attendance at receptions and social gatherings sponsored by the Committee.</li></ul><p>Application details:</p><ul class="list-unordered"><li>Detailed description of the planned research project to be undertaken during the term of the fellowship</li><li>Budget detail of the research expenses</li><li><em>Curriculum vita</em> that includes activities undertaken since gaining emeritus status</li></ul><p>Applications should be sent to the email account <a href="mailto:Dean_of_Faculty@emory.edu">Dean_of_Faculty@emory.edu</a>&#160;with &#8220;Heilbrun Fellowship&#8221; in the subject line and be received by Friday, May 1. (Deadline was April 1)</p><h3>Named Chair Nominations</h3><p>It is the time of the year that you consider nominating your colleagues for a named chair. We are not certain how many such chairs we will be able to consider for the upcoming year, but your nominations play a crucial role in helping identify faculty deserving of further recommendation.</p><p>Three <strong>Winship Distinguished Research Awards</strong> are awarded every year. All nominations are kept on file for three years. In particular, nominations for the Dobbs and White chairs may be considered over several years, and new materials may be added to the file after the initial nomination. <strong>Generally speaking, nominees should not already be holders of named chairs.</strong></p><p><strong>Descriptions of Named Chairs and the Winship Award:</strong></p><ul class="list-unordered"><li>Samuel Candler Dobbs: Full professors who have shown extraordinary accomplishment and considerable future promise in research and teaching.</li><li>Goodrich C. White: Full professors who have distinguished themselves by extraordinary service to the university and by strong accomplishment in research and teaching.</li><li>Winship Distinguished Research Award: Tenured faculty who demonstrate singular accomplishments in research. Such recognition should honor achievement and further scholarly research and research-based teaching. Awarded for a three-year term.</li></ul><p>To nominate a member of your faculty, submit a brief letter of nomination (no more than one page) and a copy of their detailed CV to the email address: <a href="mailto:Dean_of_Faculty@emory.edu">Dean_of_Faculty@emory.edu</a>&#160;by Friday, May 15.

That swift transition represents a cultural sea change from our normal academic routines and campus operations, and its success is due, in no small part, to each and every one of you.&#160;</p><p>Congratulations on embracing the rapid changes necessary to keep our learning channels &#8212; and our community &#8212; strong, stable and functional.</p><p>For some of us, learning and working online will be familiar. For others, it may represent a first-time experience. Together, we are making it work &#8212; every day, finding our way forward. And with each success, both large and small, our confidence and resolve is strengthened.</p><p>We recognize that the rough edges of this transition have been smoothed by the dedication of many, many individuals, whose tireless, behind-the-scenes efforts have helped keep the very machinery of Emory humming. Our deepest thanks goes out to all Emory students, faculty and staff for the hard work, long hours and resilience you&#8217;ve demonstrated in going the extra mile to make this possible. It has been an extraordinary effort.</p><p>As we continue adapting to change, an important reminder: For students, faculty and staff who remain on campus, starting this week all&#160;Atlanta and Oxford campus buildings will be secured and only&#160;<a href="http://www.campserv.emory.edu/covid19/epd-response.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">accessible</a> with&#160;an active Emory ID card.&#160;This security measure is necessary for protection of personnel and property as a result of changes to the campus operating environment&#160;due to&#160;COVID-19.&#160;&#160;</p><p>Amid these new developments, we also want to acknowledge important, long-standing traditions here at Emory. As we move together as a community through this spring semester &#8212; always a time of growth and renewal &#8212; we&#8217;re also preparing to welcome our newest cohort of student scholars, the Class of 2024.</p><p>The evening of Wednesday, March 25, our final round of admitted first-year students will receive their eagerly awaited confirmation emails, inviting them to join the Emory community. It&#8217;s not hard for students to recall the anticipation you may have felt as a high school senior awaiting that notification as you decided where to enroll. We absolutely share in that excitement.</p><p>We also want to recognize the important work being done by teams at the Office of Admission on the Atlanta campus and the Office of Enrollment Services on the Oxford campus to share admissions information with prospective Emory students. In the days ahead, those offices will continue working diligently to provide new remote opportunities for future Eagles to connect with current students, faculty, and staff.&#160;</p><p>For the latest developments in our new normal together, we invite you to check out the recently relaunched <a href="https://www.emory.edu/coronavirus/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Emory COVID-19 website</a>, which now features information organized to provide quick answers for faculty, staff and students, including important resources for remote learning and working.&#160;</p><p>Thank you for standing with Emory as we face our shared challenges &#8212; honoring the past, while building toward the future.&#160;</p><p>Sincerely,&#160;</p><p>Jan Love, Interim Provost and Executive Vice President for Academic Affairs</p><p>Christopher L.

While that will necessarily bring changes, it won&#8217;t deter our mission to create and share knowledge, and it will not break our sense of community.</p><p>While the changes we are experiencing may feel isolating and even overwhelming, in a remarkable way they have also brought us closer together, as we navigate this shared experience. And there are parts of the Emory experience that will not change. Emory faculty remain among the very best in their fields, with the resources and creativity to deliver an exceptional learning experience. Our talented staff remain dedicated to our mission and service to our students. And the resiliency of our student body is inspiring. Thank you to everyone for your contributions to our community.</p><p>For everyone, confronting COVID-19 requires a big adjustment. But as you grapple with new challenges, please know that you are not alone &#8212; resources are available, along with people eager to help, even from afar.</p><p>We encourage everyone to prioritize their mental health and wellbeing in the coming days and weeks. If you are on campus or if you are at home, the following resources are available to you: Students: <a href="http://counseling.emory.edu/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Counseling and Psychological Services</a> and <a href="http://oxford.emory.edu/life/campus_life/counseling_career.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Oxford Counseling and Career Services</a>&#160; Staff:&#160; <a href="https://www.hr.emory.edu/eu/working-covid-19/index.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Working Through COVID-19</a> and <a href="http://www.fsap.emory.edu/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">FSAP</a>.&#160;&#160;&#160;</p><p>And each day, please take time for self-care. Get some fresh air, take a walk, get some exercise &#8212;all of which can be accomplished while maintaining social distancing. We are impressed with the many ways our students are maintaining relationships across the miles, and are hard at work to provide additional opportunities to connect and maintain the heart of Emory, even at a distance.&#160;</p><p>For those students, staff and faculty who must remain on campus, we ask you to continue exercising care and compassion by <strong>practicing social distancing</strong>. That includes avoiding gatherings of more than 10 people and remaining six feet apart at all times. Under these federal recommendations, parties and large social gatherings are discouraged at this time.&#160;</p><p>To support security and social distancing measures, Emory&#8217;s Atlanta and Oxford College campuses have made adjustments to operating structures, which include campus building closures and reduced hours of operation and summer program cancellations:</p><h2>Atlanta and Oxford Campus</h2><h3>Building Security and Access</h3><p>Beginning Monday, March 23, all <strong>Atlanta and Oxford campus buildings will be secured and will only be accessible </strong><strong>with an active Emory ID card</strong>.&#160;This security measure is necessary for protection of personnel and property as a result of changes to the campus operating environment due to COVID-19.&#160; While most faculty, staff and students have active Emory ID cards that will permit access to their buildings, we anticipate some may not.&#160;Those who lack required building access should coordinate access with your department and the EmoryCard office.&#160;Questions may be directed to: <a href="mailto:emorycard@emory.edu">emorycard@emory.edu</a>. Additional information about pop-up EmoryCard Office access will be provided in a separate communication.</p><h2>Atlanta Campus</h2><h3>Closed or Reduced Hours of Operation</h3><ul class="list-unordered"><li>Currently closed: Woodruff P.E. Center, Student Activity &amp; Academic Center (excepting mail and dining), Emory Student Center, Alumni Memorial University Center, Schwartz Center for Performing Arts, Carlos Museum, Woodruff Library, Barnes &amp; Noble</li><li>Reduced hours: Dining hall hours will vary. Visit the <a href="https://www.emory.edu/dining/">Dining website</a> for updated hours and availability.</li><li>Boxed food options: For those remaining on the Druid Hills campus,&#160;boxed meals can be picked up in the Dobbs Common Table in the Emory Student Center at the hours indicated on the <a href="https://www.emory.edu/dining/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Dining website</a>.</li></ul><h3>Parking and Transportation&#160;</h3><p>Beginning Friday, March 20, until further notice, the parking decks listed below will have free entry/exit for use by Emory and Emory Healthcare personnel who are considered essential.&#160;This change in parking policy is provided to support social distancing during the COVID-19 campus operating environment.&#160;Email any parking questions to <a href="mailto:parking@emory.edu">parking@emory.edu</a>.

Emory also encourages&#160;faculty and staff responsible for organizing any&#160;Summer 2020&#160;Emory-sponsored international travel for&#160;graduate or professional students, either group or individual, to&#160;reconsider&#160;their plans, as such travel may not be allowed&#160;given the&#160;uncertain duration&#160;of the international travel suspension.</p><p>This decision is being made in light of Emory&#8217;s international travel suspension and the possibility that planned summer travel could be disrupted by potential entry restrictions by the U.S. and other countries.&#160;Moreover, as Emory and its partners and colleagues abroad focus on their COVID-19 response, preparations that would normally be made to ensure safe and meaningful academic experiences abroad cannot be effectively executed.</p><p>Students who have been planning Emory-sponsored travel should work with their units on any logistical or administrative issues resulting from this cancelation, such as the refund of paid deposits.&#160;Emory understands the importance of summer experiences abroad to students&#8217; Emory program and remains committed to working with them to ensure academic continuity during this challenging time.</p><p>As we continue to respond to the unprecedented impact of this historic COVID-19 pandemic, we remain inspired and grateful for your help in facing change together. We encourage you to be patient next week with the faculty as we launch our courses remotely, with our staff as we implement new technology, and with each other as we find our new normal.&#160;</p><p>The strength of our combined efforts today will go far in protecting the health and safety of everyone in the days to come. We can all play a role in helping turn the tide of this ongoing public health crisis.

As we face new and unique challenges during the current COVID-19 pandemic, the urgency of this mission could not be clearer. At the same time, the health and safety of students, faculty, staff, patients, and the general community are of critical importance to Emory. Safe-guarding our community and stewarding health-care resources are among our highest priorities.</p><p>We are committed to balancing our essential research enterprise with the imperative to implement social distancing, as recommended by the CDC (<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-nCoV/index.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">CDC COVID-19</a>), to flatten the curve of the pandemic and do our part to keep our community safe and healthy. As such, we are writing to provide Emory's guidance regarding on-campus laboratory research while we mitigate COVID-19 challenges. <strong>Effective immediately, laboratory researchers should begin a pandemic-mitigation process to suspend and conclude experiments and reduce direct contact study visits with participants for all non-essential, non-critical, on-campus research. The process to wind down these activities should be completed no later than Monday, March 23. </strong>Until further notice, only those activities designated by school or unit leaders as <em>essential</em> during this period should be conducted in on-site laboratories. You will need to communicate with your school or unit leaders for guidance in determining what is critical during this period.&#160;</p><p>Peer institution responses to the pandemic&#8212;such as those by Harvard, Stanford, and Johns Hopkins&#8212;were considered in this guidance to redirect and wind down along with<span>&#160;</span><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-business-response.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">CDC guidelines</a><span>&#160;</span>and<span>&#160;</span><a href="https://www.emory.edu/coronavirus/index.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Emory guidelines</a>.<span>&#160;</span>Thus,<span>&#160;</span><strong>all but essential research activities (as defined for this situation and determined at the school level) should start the ramp down, effectively immediately and completed no later than March 23</strong>.</p><p>Emory's ramp down will include all on-sites research activities, including laboratory and certain human subjects research.&#160; <strong>Access to laboratories ramping down will be minimal</strong>, only to allow maintenance of critical activities, such as completing ongoing research that is at a crucial phase, maintaining animals, and safeguarding unique reagents and essential materials and equipment.</p><p>Research that is deemed essential/critical during this period by your school or unit leaders may continue&#8212;but only upon implementation of stringent social distancing and handwashing precautions. Some examples of research to be designated as essential/critical at this time may include research related to COVID-19, that for which a halt would result in irreversible loss, and other critical and essential research as determined by your school or unit leader to be of substantive benefit. <strong>Requests for consideration to proceed as &#8220;essential research&#8221; should be submitted to the senior research officer in your school or unit as soon as possible and no later than March 20. </strong></p><p>After March 23, all non-essential, in-person human subjects research, community-based and clinical research that does not meet the criteria noted above, should be <strong>suspended until further notice</strong>. <strong>All new studies that have not yet started should be postponed</strong>. Research that can be conducted remotely or virtually is strongly encouraged and can proceed.</p><p>To reduce non-essential clinical research activities, further guidance and tools will be forthcoming on a tiered approach.</p><p>If essential in-person work needs to be completed, this should be done on a limited basis, and lab staff should abide by social distancing practices including the option of shift work that minimizes personnel overlap.</p><p>We understand this will be disruptive, and it is not intended to be a full shut down of research at Emory. Rather, this policy is intended to minimize spread of COVID-19 through in-person contacts. Therefore, we encourage you, your students, and your research team to take this opportunity to focus on the activities that can be conducted remotely, such as completing data analysis, writing papers, and drafting grant proposals.</p><p>We encourage you to continue the structure of your teams of staff and postdocs, even while working remotely. Federal guidance has stated the salaries for remote workers will be allowable during this time, thus please continue charging them to grants as usual. The NIH is also working on lengthening timelines for certain activities such as progress reports, etc. &#160;Additionally, a <a href="http://ora.emory.edu/COVID/index.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">website</a> has been created for the COVID-19 response for researchers and it is being updated daily.&#160; We recommend someone on your team be assigned to check it frequently as we post updates from sponsors.</p><p>In addition, Emory&#8217;s <a href="http://ora.emory.edu/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">research administration support</a> offices are well prepared for remote support, and they will serve your research needs to the best of their ability over the coming weeks.</p><p>Please read the following carefully:</p><h2>Immediate Steps</h2><ul class="list-unordered"><li>PIs should immediately identify essential research experiments that are at a critical phase. We anticipate this would mean that abandoning them would cause irreversible and irreparable loss.&#160; With consideration of the issues raised above, school and unit leadership may wish to support the completion of critical experiments.</li><li>When considering research that requires a physical presence in the laboratory, labs should, at most, carry out limited amounts of only the highest priority work as established by PIs in consultation with their school leadership. We understand that there is some subjectivity in the definition of high priority and essential. &#160;As such, these decisions should be made in concert with the PI and their school's designated leader.</li></ul><h2>Students and Other Learners in Laboratories</h2><ul class="list-unordered"><li>Undergraduates, volunteers, and visitors, including non-Emory students, are not permitted in any laboratory, even those conducting critical research.</li><li>Critical functions should not be assigned to graduate students. Graduate students should begin working remotely immediately, or as soon as the research ramp down process is complete, but no later than the March 23 deadline.&#160; Mentors should work with graduate students to develop individualized plans to maintain progress towards completing their dissertations and other academic work. In the event that a laboratory engaged in essential research activities requires graduate students to maintain a functioning effort, graduate student participation must be approved by the student's program director or director of graduate studies, the department chair of the investigator, and the Laney Graduate School. The resulting decision should be reported to the School/Unit Dean.</li><li>If the criterion of &#8220;essential&#8221; is met and approved, a postdoc of a research team may, at their own discretion, continue to work physically in the laboratory. In other words, unless their presence is required for an essential role, trainees who wish to work remotely should be allowed to do so, and PIs should work to facilitate that effort.</li></ul><h2>What to Do In Case of Any Illness</h2><ul class="list-unordered"><li>If you think you may have been exposed to COVID-19 and develop a fever, cough or difficulty breathing,&#160;don&#8217;t come to work, separate yourself from others, and call your healthcare provider for medical advice. <strong>Students</strong>: Call Student Health Services, 404-727-7551. <strong>Faculty and staff</strong>: Call the Office of Occupational Injury Management, 404-686-8587. After hours or on weekends, call the OIM Nurse Practitioner on call at 404-686-5500 and enter the ID #50464. If you are having chest pain, serious difficulty breathing, or another type of medical emergency, please call 911.</li><li>Contact your supervisor and OIM to inform them of your illness.</li><li>If you are instructed to stay at home, don&#8217;t leave except to get medical care&#8212;review the&#160;<span></span><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/about/steps-when-sick.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">steps</a><span>&#160;</span>to prevent the spread of COVID-19.</li><li>Once symptom-free, call OIM to get cleared to come back to work.</li><li>Additional information can be found at&#160;<a href="https://www.emory.edu/coronavirus/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Coronavirus Updates for the Emory Community</a>, a website dedicated to our response to COVID-19.&#160;</li></ul><h2>Managing Laboratory Activities &#160;</h2><ul class="list-unordered"><li>Laboratory work specifically related to COVID-19 is continuing to expand and should continue.</li><li>Disinfect the common lab areas and touchpoints according to the <a href="http://ehso.emory.edu/documents/ehs-201-regulated-waste-guidelines.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank">EHSO guidelines</a>.</li><li>Beginning March 23, <strong>access to labs will be exclusively for school or unit approved essential personnel who perform critical procedures and experiments, equipment management, or animal management that require personal attention to maintain laboratory viability</strong> (e.g. liquid nitrogen tank filling, animal support, maintaining shared computational equipment). Notify your school leadership immediately about who these individuals are.</li><li><strong>Essential work in labs should be staggered</strong> so that minimal personnel (in accord with social distancing concepts) are present at any one time. Consider using flex time and off-hours to achieve social distancing. Physical safety is a consideration in situations where a single person is in a laboratory&#8212;a virtual check-in/out should be implemented to in these situations.</li><li>Communicate frequently, and review contingency plans and emergency procedures with your group.</li><li>Meetings should be held online or by phone, including one-on-one meetings and formal lab or group meetings. Groups should use the available video conferencing and networking tools, such as Zoom or Skype business, to continue to interact regularly.</li><li>PIs should prepare for the eventuality that an individual in their group will test positive for COVID-19. Given the current projections, this is a likely scenario for many research groups. <strong>Laboratory spaces and offices used by an individual found to be COVID-19 positive will be closed, disinfected, and prepared for re-occupancy</strong>. Incidents should be reported immediately to OIM.</li></ul><h2>Guidance Regarding the Division of Animal Resources</h2><ul class="list-unordered"><li>The Office remains open and fully functional.</li><li>Large animal surgery, with the exception of terminal procedures, has been discontinued.</li><li>Animal ordering from approved vendors is winding down, but will remain intact for experiments and activities (e.g., cryopreservation) determined to be essential.</li><li>Animal imports into quarantine and exports have been suspended.</li><li>In-person training, such as Tuesday new facility orientation, has been discontinued.</li><li>The overall focus is on high-quality animal care and preservation of the environment to enable current experiments to continue.</li><li>Recommendations for our research partners:
<ul class="list-unordered"><li>Investigators encouraged to conclude experiments, not start lengthy or complicated ones, and consider euthanasia of surplus animals.</li><li>Labs are encouraged to ensure contact information is in place for communication with and from vet staff.</li></ul></li></ul><p>Our primary concern is for the safety of our faculty, staff, and trainees. Wash your hands frequently, and practice social distancing.</p><p>Thank you in advance for your efforts to keep our community safe in this global health crisis. Questions and feedback will be regularly monitored, and the FAQs on the <a href="http://ora.emory.edu/COVID/index.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">ORA COVID-19 page</a> will be routinely updated.</p><p>Sincerely,</p><p>Jan Love, Interim Provost and Executive Vice President for Academic Affairs</p><p>Christopher L.

You will find an array of guidance and information on the <a href="http://college.emory.edu/oisp/remoteteaching/index.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Emory College Academic Continuity &amp; Remote Teaching site</a>.</p><p>The College is not mandating a particular content delivery model that all courses must follow. Some faculty will choose to deliver content <a href="http://college.emory.edu/oisp/remoteteaching/teaching/synchronous.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">synchronously</a> (via live Zoom sessions), while others will rely primarily on <a href="http://college.emory.edu/oisp/remoteteaching/teaching/asynchronous.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">asynchronous</a> modes of delivery (pre-recorded lectures, Canvas discussions, etc.). Most courses will contain a mix of both approaches. Your decision about content delivery in each course will depend on many factors, including course enrollments, course content, and the technological capacity of faculty and students.</p><p>All faculty of ECAS courses should follow a few common parameters in order to streamline the learning experience for students:</p><ul class="list-unordered"><li>Please communicate with your students no later than <strong>Thursday, March 19</strong> to let them know what to expect from you when classes reconvene remotely next week. This first communication should go out via email and Canvas.</li><li>Use Canvas as the primary organizational and communications tool for your students.</li><li>If faculty do hold synchronous sessions for their course, those sessions must be offered during the regularly scheduled class time in order to avoid conflicts with other courses. All synchronous sessions should be recorded and posted to Canvas in case students have difficulties in accessing the synchronous meeting.</li></ul><p>Please review the <a href="http://college.emory.edu/oisp/remoteteaching/index.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Emory College Academic Continuity &amp; Remote Teaching site</a> for suggested approaches to transitioning particular activities and <a href="http://college.emory.edu/oisp/remoteteaching/pedagogy/non-classroom-courses/index.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">types of courses</a>, <a href="http://college.emory.edu/oisp/remoteteaching/pedagogy/accessibility.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">information about accessibility</a>, <a href="http://college.emory.edu/oisp/remoteteaching/tools/index.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">tutorials for Emory&#8217;s relevant technologies</a>, and <a href="http://college.emory.edu/oisp/remoteteaching/support/index.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">important support links</a>.</p><p>If your department would like to schedule a remote teaching workshop or consultation with a member of the College&#8217;s team via Zoom, contact <a href="mailto:sejacks@emory.edu">Sara Wade</a>.

Students will be contacted by the Office of Financial Aid.</span></p><h2><span>Student Employee Salary Replacement</span><span></span></h2><p><span>Emory students of various income levels and backgrounds hold jobs at Emory and are classified as student employees. These jobs may be administrative, research focused, athletic support or various other activities. The rate of pay is different for each student employee and the hours may vary by job as well as by week-to-week availability, depending upon the student&#8217;s academic load and the unit&#8217;s need. We are concerned about the impact of COVID-19 on the financial well-being of these students who depend on this income in their financial planning.</span></p><p><span>As a means of supporting our student employees as the university moves to remote work and students are leaving campus, we propose to pay estimated earnings for the remaining weeks of the term based on their historical time worked.&#160; Students may check with their hiring unit to see if it is possible to continue to work remotely and may be paid for that time as well.</span></p><h2>Emory Employees Pay and Compensation<span></span></h2><p><span>We are making the commitment that regular faculty and staff employed by Emory University will be paid as usual for the current anticipated duration of the social distancing protocols, no matter their role within Emory and the altered learning/working environment. The process and details are still in development, but we are committed to continuation of pay from Emory during this time of uncertainty.</span></p><p>Emory&#8217;s administration is<span> committed to our students&#8217; health and well-being, and we are dedicated to supporting their educational journeys with creativity and innovation as they progress along chosen academic pathways.</span></p><p>Sincerely,</p><p><span>Jan Love, Interim Provost and Executive Vice President for Academic Affairs</span></p><p><span>Christopher L.

To follow up on that commitment, I am notifying you that the two Emory University students in undergraduate housing who were reported as being tested for possible COVID-19 on March 14 <strong>have both tested negative</strong>. The two students will remain in off-campus housing provided by the university until other arrangements can be made. A third student who lives off-campus <strong>also tested negative</strong>.</p><p>Also confirmed today, two undergraduate students residing at Emory Point <strong>have tested positive for COVID-19</strong>. Both students are in satisfactory condition and are self-isolating in their off-campus apartment. The two students, who were away for spring break, have not been on campus for more than a week and did not report feeling ill until they returned home from break. The students are being supported and closely monitored by Emory's student health services staff.&#160;&#160;</p><p>More information is being gathered about their recent activity and will be shared with those who have been in direct contact with these students. &#160;Whenever pertinent information becomes available, we will share it with the Emory community.&#160;</p><p>As the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases increases in Georgia and across the country, students should self-assess for fever or cough. Students who develop symptoms need to separate themselves from others and call Student Health Services at 404-727-7551 (Clifton Rd. campus), or Oxford College Student Services at 770-784-8376. Off campus students should contact their primary care physician if they feel sick or call 911 if their symptoms warrant emergency care.</p><p>As the trajectory of cases is likely to increase, Emory will continue to report on COVID-19 testing among students, faculty and staff and will report outcomes to the community and the public via the <span><a href="https://www.emory.edu/coronavirus/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Emory COVID-19 website</a></span>. Additional resources and key updates can also be found on the webpage.</p><p>I am keenly aware of the anxiety, uncertainty, and concern that so many of us are experiencing during this global public health crisis. Profound disruptions to our daily lives are multiplying. In the midst of these major stressors, I encourage you to keep in mind that Emory&#8217;s commitment to the health and safety of our community is paramount. A team of representatives from emergency preparedness, health care, campus life and other units are working to protect students, faculty, staff and visitors. We also continue to partner closely with local, state, and federal agencies.</p><p>I want to thank the many members of our community who are rising to the occasion and caring for those in our community and beyond. I especially want to thank our courageous Emory healthcare workers who are on the front lines of this fight. While this is not how we hoped the spring semester would unfold, together we will see our way through this crisis. And together, we will emerge stronger as a community.</p><p>With gratitude,</p><p>Claire E.

We&#8217;ve seen staff members working long hours to assist students with specific needs, faculty rapidly developing online lesson plans, and caring alumni who&#8217;ve stepped forward to volunteer their help.&#160;</p><p>That outpouring of support has been heartwarming and, of course, not unexpected. For those who are able and eager to help, please consider contributing to the&#160;<a href="https://momentum.emory.edu/project/15970" rel="noopener" target="_blank">student hardship fund</a><u>.</u>&#160;In addition, the&#160;<a href="https://momentum.emory.edu/project/20378" rel="noopener" target="_blank">faculty and staff hardship fund</a>&#160;offers assistance to other members of our campus community who might be impacted by COVID-19.</p><p>Moving forward, perhaps one of the most important things we can all do is stay strong and healthy for each other &#8212; for our communities, our families and our friends. Let&#8217;s work to preserve those connections, our fundamental human bonds.&#160;</p><p>Amid these remarkable times, let us prove what a community can be.&#160;</p><p>Together, we will be stronger for it.&#160;</p><br/><p>In community,&#160;</p><p>Jan Love, Interim Provost and Executive Vice President for Academic Affairs&#160;</p><p>Christopher L.

This is mandatory to support the health and safety both for the remote workers, and for the workers who must work on campus; the fewer people on campus, the less chance of spreading infection.</p><p>Because we are here to serve the academic, research and healthcare missions of the university, there are many employees whose presence on campus is required, either to care for animals, provide necessary services to faculty, students or patients, conduct research in onsite settings, and many other responsibilities. Many employees will be working to support students during this transition time, or to support the conduct of remote learning. <strong>These employees must continue to report to campus.</strong></p><p>Each unit will make the determination as to which employees are required to be on campus, and which can work remotely. <strong>Please check with your supervisor to understand the specifics of your job. They will let you know whether you will be expected to continue to work on campus, or whether you are expected to work remotely.&#160;</strong></p><p>To assist supervisors and employees who will transition to remote work, <a href="https://www.hr.emory.edu/eu/working-covid-19/index.html">guidelines for remote work</a> are posted on the <a href="https://www.hr.emory.edu/eu/index.html">Human Resources website</a>. These include several resources for teleworking successfully, such as technology and training links.</p><h2>Pay and Redeployment</h2><p>Emory&#8217;s executive leadership has committed that no regular employee&#8217;s pay will be affected by their ability or inability to perform work remotely. There may be some employees whose jobs are not suitable to remote work, but are not considered essential for on campus work.&#160; The university may decide to redeploy some employees, when possible, into jobs that can be performed remotely. <strong>Employees will be expected to be flexible in accepting assignments in these cases. If there is no possible way for these employees to continue to work, they will nevertheless remain at home</strong>.&#160;These employees will continue to receive their regular pay for the current anticipated duration of the &#8220;social distancing&#8221; protocols.</p><p>We are currently working to develop additional policies that will apply during this difficult time. This includes guidance for employees who must care for children whose schools are closed or who must care for others, or become ill themselves. Please be aware that we expect policies to evolve as time goes by and more information becomes available.</p><p>We know this is a challenging transition, and moving to remote work will not be perfect. However, we believe our talented and dedicated employees will be able to adapt, remain committed, and get even better as time goes along.</p><p>Please continue to stay informed by checking <a href="https://www.emory.edu/coronavirus/">Emory&#8217;s Coronavirus website</a> regularly.

We will, however, institute some social distancing practices to protect the health and continuity of our community.</p><p>As you now know, Spring Break will be extended by one week with no classes conducted during this period (March 16 &#8211; 22, 2020). Starting on March 23, 2020, undergraduate and graduate classes will transition to remote learning (Zoom, Canvas, and other forms of delivery) through the end of the semester. As campus will remain open through the end of the semester, faculty can come to campus in order to utilize the expertise of the instructional design team, registrar, and Goizueta Technology Services to help convert material. Faculty may use their offices and other spaces within Goizueta to deliver classes remotely. Goizueta Technology Services is crafting a message that will be sent to students via the Program Offices to ensure they are able to access course content during this period.</p><h2>Faculty and Staff</h2><p>We are aware that there are faculty and staff who are themselves, or live with, individuals considered to be in high risk populations. Thus we want to provide as much flexibility as possible while ensuring that the operations of the business school happen with minimal disruption through the end of the semester. Therefore, faculty and staff should continue to do the majority of their work consistent with how they have ordinarily performed their duties. For most of us that means working from Goizueta Business School. Staff can discuss remote work options or use of personal leave time with their supervisors if there are reasons they are unable to work on campus during this time frame.</p><h2>Events</h2><p>Effective immediately all in-person Goizueta sponsored events for students, alumni, and prospects occurring through March 22 should be canceled, postponed, or moved to remote delivery. This is to accommodate the unusual circumstances associated with an additional week of spring break. This change extends to events happening on or off-campus and includes but is not limited to recruitment and networking events, student programs, conferences, social events, and board meetings.</p><p>At this point, it will be left to the organizer&#8217;s discretion whether or not to proactively postpone, cancel or utilize remote delivery for events happening after March 22. We are awaiting guidance from the University on this matter and will update our guidance as soon as we receive additional information. Best practices suggest utilizing virtual delivery when possible for larger gatherings. Organizers will need to ensure any auxiliary services such as catering, facilities/events management, marketing and communications, etc. can be fulfilled well in advance. Please work with Susan-Anne MacKenna on negotiating contract policies.</p><h2>Community and Self Care</h2><p>Campus Services has implemented an additional cleaning process. This step utilizes a disinfectant that will be sprayed in common spaces across all campus facilities. The disinfectant will not be applied in private spaces. The process occurs during the overnight shift. Outside of these hours, Campus Services will continue cleaning and disinfecting high traffic areas.</p><p>For all events and meetings, we urge faculty, staff and students to remind each other of good hygiene practices including frequent hand washing; to voluntarily remove yourself from the event if you are not feeling well; and to make accommodations for ill or self-quarantined individuals.</p><h2>Questions</h2><p>Additional information about the following topics will be available as soon as possible: commencement, summer and fall semester registration, and domestic and international travel restrictions.</p><ul class="list-unordered"><li>For questions related to teaching continuity and program delivery please contact Ed Leonard or Andrea Hershatter</li><li>For questions related to faculty affairs please contact Anandhi Bhardwaj</li><li>For questions related staffing and human resources please contact Alicia Sierra</li></ul><p>Emory University has a comprehensive website that is updated frequently.<br/><br/>Best,<br/><br/>Erika H.

The decision has been made by the university to extend spring break until March 22 for students. Classes will resume in a remote learning environment on March 23 through the end of the semester. The university currently recommends cancelling all gatherings not essential to the academic mission of the school, and will send additional guidance in this area soon.</span></p><p><span>The university is making decisions based on the latest available information from the CDC and public health experts. As a school, it is important that we align with and complement university-level guidelines. We know that sudden shifts in operations can be challenging. Please know that we are here to assist and support you throughout this transition. We learned a lot about how to most effectively target faculty and staff for relevant technology training based on the survey that many of you completed earlier this week, so thank you for taking the time to provide this valuable information.</span></p><p><span>Our goal for the next 10 days is to prepare our faculty and students for the immediate shift to remote course delivery effective March 23. The Rollins COVID-19 Preparation and Response team has drafted guidance for faculty, staff, and students to support this transition and to ensure the smooth continuation of all operations. Included in this guidance are detailed instructions on how to access the necessary support to transition coursework to Internet-based platforms (this includes online support, webinars, and in-person technical support).We will share this guidance document with all of you later today. Please note that this is a working document that will be adjusted daily as the situation rapidly evolves. Please also regularly visit the Rollins website for up-to-date COVID-19-related information as it pertains to Rollins, including the latest version of the guidance document.</span></p><p><span>At this point in time, faculty and staff should continue to report to work as normal.

Given the dynamic nature of the outbreak, we strongly recommend that all Emory faculty, students, and staff reconsider domestic and international travel, especially for senior members of the community and individuals at increased risk for severe illness. We anticipate releasing additional guidance related to travel restriction in the next 24-48 hours.</p><p>The decision to transition to remote learning, limit events, and offer telecommuting options is consistent with CDC guidelines to prevent the further spread of COVID-19 and reflect similar actions from peer institutions. We carefully considered all options to ensure that our entire community can feel safe in these uncertain times. We appreciate your flexibility, patience, and commitment to our community as we navigate the path forward together. &#160;While we do not have all of the answers to the very many questions that will naturally follow from our decision to take these measures to protect our community and those in the greater Atlanta region, we pledge to keep you informed as the path forward becomes clear.

As members of the global health care community, I believe we should, whenever possible, offer an informed, calm, discerning, and encouraging voice in the midst of a rapidly-changing situation in public health and safety.&#160;</p><p>The Emory University community feels the effects of coronavirus. International students from affected regions are understandably concerned about family and friends and what a continued outbreak could mean for their travel home. To address this&#8212;and other aspects of the virus&#8212;the university created a<span>&#160;</span><a href="https://news.emory.edu/stories/2020/01/er_tn_coronavirus/campus.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">webpage full of helpful resources</a>. The page is updated regularly. Additionally,<span>&#160;</span><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a page on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&#8217;s website</a><span>&#160;</span>details the virus, how it is transmitted, and the extent of the outbreak. To note, steps to slow the spread are the same as those taken in response to other respiratory viruses: Wash your hands regularly, sneeze and cough into your elbow, stay home if sick, etc.</p><p>The university&#8217;s response to coronavirus is coordinated between many offices, including (but not limited to): The Office of the Provost, Campus Life, Office of the Executive Vice President for Business and Administration, Human Resources, and the Office of Critical Event Preparedness and Response (<a href="http://emergency.emory.edu/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">CEPAR</a>). Their decisions are<span>&#160;</span><a href="https://news.emory.edu/stories/2020/01/er_tn_coronavirus/campus.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reflected on the university website</a>. Regular, ongoing conversations occur on preparation and response should the situation evolve in a way it directly impacts Emory campuses.&#160;</p><p>The nursing school will continue to take guidance and follow policies set forth by the university, especially those related to student travel and study abroad opportunities. We will also support our international students in any way possible, choosing empathy for all backgrounds and standing up against cases of xenophobia that may arise in this time of intense media scrutiny and (oftentimes) misinformation. As an inclusive community, such behaviors will not be tolerated. The university<span>&#160;</span><a href="https://news.emory.edu/stories/2020/01/er_tn_coronavirus/campus.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">provides resources</a><span>&#160;</span>to help students in distress. You can also reach out to Arnita Howard in the Office of Enrollment and Student Affairs if you have any questions or concerns.</p><p>Times like these present opportunities to bring out the best in nursing and nurse education. Pandemics are part of professional life; this is a chance for many of our students to showcase skills and compassion in a safe, clinical environment. Kristy Martyn has agreed to be the school&#8217;s primary contact in regards to the coronavirus and how it may affect course delivery and clinicals.</p><p>As I mentioned, this situation is changing rapidly. Please check the Emory and CDC update sites regularly. I will update everyone as necessary, especially if the university restricts travel to one of our study destinations or there are changes in access to our students&#8217; clinical environments or classroom activities.</p><p>Thanks to everyone for being representatives of our community and standing for our values each and every day.</p><p>Warm Regards,<br/>Linda&#160;</p><div class="clearfix"></div></div></div></td></tr><tr id="sph-mar-3"><td class="small">

I want to share that with you via email as well.&#160; Please keep in mind that this is only an outline.&#160; As you know from reading the news, the spread of coronavirus is a rapidly evolving situation; we are both trying to address the current moment and plan for possible contingencies.&#160; In doing so, the University is working closely with the CDC and Georgia Public Health.&#160; In fact, between the CDC and Emory&#8217;s own history of working with infectious disease, it is hard to imagine a more substantial collection of expertise than what we have on the Clifton corridor. &#160;</p><p>I&#8217;ll break the planning and response into categories, even though they overlap:</p><ul class="list-unordered"><li>First, you should know the Office of International and Summer Programs (OISP) has been working and focusing on students who either were planning or are currently studying in areas heavily affected by coronavirus and/or travel restrictions.&#160; For instance, we have worked on alternate pathways for students who were planning to study in China this semester, and we are monitoring how students in areas like Italy are faring.&#160; Fortunately, the study abroad providers have been both responsive and communicative, which has made this work much easier.</li><li>OISP and Campus Life have also been working on contingency planning for the coming summer.&#160; This includes the possibility that some of our international students may not be able to return home, as well as the possibility that some of our summer programs may be affected.&#160; We are exploring summer housing and study options for affected students, and are also communicating with students who have signed up for summer study abroad.&#160; We have not yet made any decisions about summer programs, but will of course need to do so in the coming weeks.</li></ul><p>If you have questions about summer programs or study abroad, your best contact at this point is Dean Sally Gouzoules; her team is deeply involved in planning and can address more specifics about a particular program.</p><ul class="list-unordered"><li>In addition, we are planning for the possibility that some of our undergraduates, including some first students, may not be able to arrive this fall because of travel restrictions.&#160; Like some of our peers, we are considering how we would deliver an on-line curriculum for such students so that they could make academic progress.&#160; If you have built an on-line course, or if you teach a class that regularly enrolls first-year students, you may be hearing from us as we work through the options.&#160;</li><li>Of course, we are also deeply concerned about international students and others from heavily affected regions, or with family there.&#160; At this point, we have focused primarily on international students, especially students from China.&#160; We want to ensure that they have the personal and academic support that they need at a moment of intense stress.&#160; Frank Gaertner in the Office of Undergraduate Education has been central to this work.&#160; We are also working with Campus Life to ensure that all students have the right information about the coronavirus and commonsense prevention.&#160; A particular concern is that students may not seek medical attention for possible influenza or other illnesses for fear of being stigmatized.</li></ul><p>If you have concerns about an undergraduate student, please do not hesitate to write directly to the Office for Undergraduate Education via Joanne Brzinski.&#160; The student support network is working hard to address the needs of our students, but you are critical to this process.</p><ul class="list-unordered"><li>Finally, there is another level of contingency planning that is transpiring regarding the possibility of coronavirus cases near or on our campus.&#160; This has not yet occurred, but of course is a possibility.&#160; Again, we have a great deal of expertise on which to draw, and the Office of Critical Event Preparedness and Response (CEPAR) is working closely with the Georgia Department of Public Health and the CDC.&#160; Among the questions that they are considering is under what conditions we might need to cancel classes or close the university&#8212;and how we would respond if there were cases of coronavirus in the residence halls.&#160; For faculty, this is a good time to review our policy about how we would make up classes in the case of inclement weather, as we would likely follow this same procedure if we needed to close the University because of coronavirus.&#160; If you look at the resources in the<span>&#160;</span><a href="http://college.emory.edu/oue/documents/make-up-inclement-weather-policy.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">inclement weather policy</a>&#160;you can think through how would proceed if a week of classes were canceled.&#160;</li></ul><p>I realize that even though this is long email, I have raised as many questions here as I have answered.&#160; I also urge you to look to the University webpage that is being updated with new information and resources.

At this time, according to the CDC,<span>&#160;</span><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-in-us.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">there are no cases in Georgia and only five confirmed cases in the United States</a>.</p><p>Due to the contagious nature of the virus, which can cause pneumonia, CDC recommends that travelers avoid all nonessential travel to China at this time. CDC and public health agencies are closely monitoring the disease. On Emory campus, a team of leaders from emergency preparedness, health care, campus life, and other units has been monitoring the outbreak closely to protect students, faculty, staff, and visitors. Emory officials also continue to work closely with local and state partners.</p><ul class="list-unordered"><li><a href="https://news.emory.edu/stories/2020/01/er_tn_coronavirus/campus.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">View Emory&#8217;s coronavirus resource page.</a></li><li><a href="http://campuslife.emory.edu/notifications/coronavirus.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Read Campus Life&#8217;s message to students</a>.</li></ul><p>If you are in a situation where essential travel to Wuhan or other areas of China are required, please refer to the<span>&#160;</span><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/index.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">guidelines listed on the CDC&#8217;s website</a>.</p><p>As public health practitioners, we know that knowledge and preparedness are our greatest tools when faced with outbreaks of this nature.
