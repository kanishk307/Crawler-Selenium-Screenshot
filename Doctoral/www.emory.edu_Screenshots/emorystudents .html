Our goal is for you to feel comfortable participating in the community and to have options that reflect your preferences for continuing your education.</p></div><!-- SHORT CODES --><div class="wysiwyg"><h3>What you need to know up front</h3><ul class="list-unordered"><li>Emory will offer <strong>both online and in-person classes</strong> this fall, allowing us to provide the excellence of an Emory education to all students.</li><li>The academic calendar will shift to <strong>start on August 19</strong>, with classes ending by Thanksgiving and exams conducted remotely.</li><li><strong>Residence halls will be open</strong> with a standard of no more than two students per room.&#160;</li></ul><h3>What remains the same</h3><p>While much will be different this fall, there are core elements of the Emory experience that will remain the same:</p><ul class="list-unordered"><li>We will deliver courses that meet Emory&#8217;s rigorous standards and that are taught by our world-renowned faculty.</li><li>You will have access to the tremendous resources of our research university, and you will be part of a community known for its support while you are pursuing your degree and throughout your career.</li><li>We will deliver an equivalent Emory experience, knowing the necessity of health and safety protocols will prevent us from providing an identical experience to past years.</li></ul><p>One lesson from the current pandemic is that plans must stay flexible to adapt to global, national and regional changes. For this reason, we ask that as you review how we envision the fall experience at this time, you also understand there may be a need for us to pivot our plan to maintain community health and preserve academic continuity. Know we have contingency plans in place should we need them.</p><h2>Fall Classes</h2><h3>Modified academic calendar</h3><p>With faculty, student and staff health and safety as necessary considerations, the academic calendar was modified so that <strong>undergraduate classes will begin no later than August 19 and conclude by Thanksgiving</strong>, with the final evaluation period conducted remotely.</p><ul class="list-unordered"><li>The traditional schedule will be further modified by <strong>holding classes on Labor Day and eliminating Fall Break</strong>.</li><li>The calendars for <strong>graduate, professional and select undergraduate programs may start a bit earlier or later</strong> and include different milestone dates. Please refer to your school&#8217;s website for further details.</li></ul><h3>Expanded online class options</h3><p>To maintain choices for our students, Emory will offer expanded online class options that are designed for a comprehensive remote learning experience.</p><ul class="list-unordered"><li><strong>Smaller in-person classes: </strong>For our classroom environments, we will cap most in-person, large lectures to minimize class sizes and to follow physical distancing guidelines.</li><li><strong>Physical distancing:</strong> Any rare but essential large lecture classes will be held in facilities that can accommodate appropriate physical distancing measures.</li><li><strong>Schedule changes:</strong> It is important to note that we expect you will need to adjust your class schedule to accommodate changes in course offerings and formats.</li><li><strong>Mix of online and in-person classes:</strong> We expect that students&#8217; schedules will have either online courses <em>or</em> a mix of in-person and online courses, based on your preference. It may be rare for students to have entirely in-person schedules.</li><li><strong>Details to come: </strong>You will receive emails explaining the new process and options in detail.</li></ul><p>Tuition will be applied uniformly regardless of the mix of online and in-person courses as we will provide equivalent experiences regardless of type of delivery.</p><p>We are committed to working with faculty to accommodate their preferred course format and with students to offer courses that meet your preferences and continue your progress toward graduation. Again, our efforts are focused on providing choice while maintaining our community&#8217;s health.</p><h3>Classroom cleanliness and safety</h3><p>Please note that strict cleaning protocols for classroom spaces will be implemented. Students will be appropriately spaced in classrooms and will be required to follow protocols for entering/exiting classrooms to avoid overlap with other students. We will implement multiple measures to ensure cleanliness and safety and will communicate those to the campus community in advance of resumption of courses.</p><h3>Remote learning tools</h3><div class="imported-block " style="width:auto"><span class="anchor" id="anchor-canvas-and-zoom---remote-learning-tools"><div id="anchor-canvas-and-zoom---remote-learning-tools"><!-- Card Row --><div class="row mb-md-5"><div class="col-sm-6 col-md-6 mb-3"><div class="card bg-white h-100"><div class="card-header">

Therefore, we will offer on-campus housing options for the fall.</p><p>Housing decisions were made after consultation with national housing experts and our own medical and health-based faculty and in accordance with multi-level health directives. As importantly, we know we have the ability, resources and expertise to implement this plan.</p><ul class="list-unordered"><li><strong>Limited occupancy:</strong> We will limit dorm room occupancy to two students per room.</li><li><strong>Single rooms:</strong> We will work with students to accommodate single room requests for those who are immunocompromised or have other health considerations.</li><li><strong>Expanding housing options:</strong> We are expanding housing options beyond the residence halls to include Emory Conference Center Hotel for Atlanta students, and hotel options for Oxford students.</li><li><strong>Preparing to return to campus:</strong> If you are planning to reside in the residence halls this fall, please watch for an email from our housing staff that outlines move-in dates and procedures, fee schedules and policies, additional checklists and considerations, and tools to help with the transition back to campus.</li></ul><p>Similar to our planning for classroom and common spaces, we will implement <strong>enhanced cleaning protocols</strong>, and all residence hall students will be made aware of our <strong>shared responsibilities to maintain cleanliness</strong>.</p><p>For our students in our residence halls, know that this fall&#8217;s experience will be different. You may be taking online courses from your room, community spaces will have new distancing and restricted occupancy expectations, and we will limit the size of gatherings &#8212; including those held in residence halls &#8212; to maintain a healthy environment.&#160;</p><h2>Testing, Social Norming and Expectations</h2><p>COVID-19 testing will be mandatory for all students living in residence halls, along with those taking in-person classes, upon or shortly before returning to campus, and will be available at any time during the semester for those who are symptomatic and for their close contacts.</p><p>We cannot guarantee you will not get sick, but together we can support each other in our academic pursuits, in community and in health.</p><h3>Testing and contact tracing</h3><ul class="list-unordered"><li>Testing of symptomatic people, as well as those in close contact with people diagnosed with COVID-19, is currently underway on campus and will continue in the fall.</li><li>Testing, contact tracing, isolation, quarantine, and other measures will be implemented to limit transmission of COVID-19 in our community.</li></ul><h3>Health monitoring</h3><ul class="list-unordered"><li>All members of the Emory community who come to campus will be required to <strong>self-monitor on a daily basis</strong> for signs of COVID-19.</li><li>Trained university staff will conduct <strong>random temperature checks</strong> across campus each day.</li><li>Those with fevers will be required to have a clinical evaluation and to be tested, as appropriate.</li></ul><p>We are developing health education programs and materials to ensure community awareness and understanding of indications of illness as well as risks that lead to the spread of the disease. We will also clearly delineate what we expect from members of our community to maintain health and cleanliness standards including face covering, distancing, cleaning protocols and general health guidance.</p><p><strong>Students <em>may not</em> opt out of community expectations for health and safety </strong>&#8212; everyone must participate for our campus community to stay healthy. Further information on testing and community awareness efforts will be sent to you in the coming weeks.</p><p><a class="btn-primary btn" href="https://www.emory.edu/forward/on-campus/health-safety-plan.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">View Emory&#8217;s Health and Safety Plan</a></p><br/><div class="imported-block " style="width:auto"><div id="anchor-school-based-information"><h2 class="text-primary" id="school-based-information">School-based Information</h2><!-- Card Row --><div class="row"><div class="col-sm-6 col-md-6 mb-3"><div class="card card-link h-100"><a href="http://college.emory.edu/oue/" target="_blank" title="Opens a new link"><div class="card-body"><p class="h4 card-title">

We know that the campus will undoubtedly&#160;be different in the fall; still, student leaders, faculty, and staff are working tirelessly to provide as enriching&#160;and engaging an experience as possible.</p><p>To help you plan for reopening in the fall, we are writing to share our preliminary plans and changes to our&#160;housing and campus dining programs in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.</p><h2>Residence Life and Housing Operations</h2><ul class="list-unordered"><li>Students living on campus will be screened by Emory University by <strong>testing</strong> for SARS-CoV-2, the virus&#160;that causes COVID-19, prior to moving into their fall housing assignment.</li><li>We anticipate student move-in beginning approximately one week before b&#160;and occurring over several days to accommodate <strong>physical distancing and testing</strong>. Students will&#160;receive additional instructions on move-in times in the coming weeks.</li><li>Residents will be required to wear <strong>face coverings</strong> in all residential common areas.</li><li>A maximum of two students per bedroom, or four to six students per apartment or suite, will be&#160;applied without exception.</li><li>Students may be <strong>assigned or reassigned</strong> by Housing Operations to reduce density, improve&#160;bathroom ratio and reduce opportunities for congregation in residence halls. As we reduce density&#160;in the residence halls as part of the assignment/reassignment process, we will try to accommodate&#160;roommate requests.</li><li>Single rooms will be available. Students who request these rooms due to medical conditions or circumstances will be prioritized for single-room assignments.</li><li><strong>During the academic year, room changes</strong> will not be granted, except for emergencies or extenuating circumstances.</li><li>Communal bathrooms and other high-touch, high-volume common spaces will undergo <strong>enhanced&#160;</strong><strong>cleaning</strong> protocols and schedules.</li><li>Occupancy in common spaces will be limited, based on Emory&#8217;s physical distancing guidelines.</li><li>Students will be required to sign the <strong>COVID-19 Addendum</strong> to the <em>2020-21 Housing Agreement and&#160;</em><em>Residence Life and Housing Policies</em> for on-campus living.</li><li>Students who no longer wish to reside on campus will be allowed to cancel their housing agreement until <strong>August 1</strong>. Additional information regarding the cancellation process will be provided in future communications.</li><li>During the week of June 22, students will receive an email from Housing Operations with access to a <strong>Housing Preference</strong> form in their <em><strong>MyHousing</strong></em> portal. If you wish to request a single room or cancel your housing agreement you may indicate so on the Housing Preference form.</li><li>Students may only be allowed into residential facilities in which they reside.</li><li><strong>Quarantine and isolation</strong> spaces will be provided for residential students who have been exposed to COVID-19 or become sick. If a student has close contact with an individual who tests positive for COVID-19, the student will receive quarantine instructions from the university.</li><li>For students who are isolated or quarantined, they should expect to receive a temporary room assignment where they will receive academic support, meal services (inclusive of dietary and religious needs), and support from Student Health Services. Additional details will be provided later in the summer in email communications from residence life and housing operations.</li><li>All students are encouraged to <strong>pack light</strong> for the semester. Please refer to the <a href="https://housing.emory.edu/policies/move_in/what_to_bring.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">&#8220;What to bring to campus&#8221; document</a> on the residence life and housing website. Students will also have the opportunity to ship items to campus. Additional details will be provided later in the summer in email communications from residence life and housing operations.</li><li>If a student lived on campus in spring 2020 and their belongings were <strong>packed and stored</strong> by Emory University, these items will be moved to their fall on-campus housing assignment. Unidentified or unclaimed items, or items belonging to students living off campus will be available for claim from a central location at a future date. Details will come in future communications.</li><li>Parking Services will do their best to accommodate campus parking requests, but space may be limited. More detail on parking will be available over the next two weeks at parking.emory.edu.</li></ul><h2>Campus Dining</h2><p>Emory campus dining remains committed to providing a full complement of dining choices and locations for the upcoming academic year.</p><ul class="list-unordered"><li>The campus community standard of <strong>physical distancing will always be required</strong> in campus dining facilities.</li><li>Students will be required to <strong>sanitize hands</strong> before entering any campus dining location.&#160;</li><li><strong>Face coverings</strong> will always be required when not eating.</li><li>Most dining locations will be <strong>take-out only; dining room seating will be limited or eliminated</strong> with occupancy based on Emory guidelines for physical distancing.</li><li>Self-serve stations have been eliminated across campus. <strong>All food will be either grab and go or&#160;</strong><strong>served by staff following strict safety guidelines.</strong></li><li>We remain committed to meeting the needs of all community members and will continue to offer&#160;<strong>Halal, Kosher, made without gluten, vegan, and vegetarian options</strong>. We will strive to offer as much variety as possible.</li><li><strong>We are revising our campus meal plan requirements and offerings</strong> for all students to provide greater flexibility. Students assigned to housing on the Clairmont Campus will not be required to&#160;enroll in a campus meal plan this year. Students who live off-campus are not required to enroll in a campus meal plan.</li><li>To expedite service, <strong>Dobbs Common Table (residential dining commons) and Cox Hall Food Court&#160;</strong><strong>will have scaled-down menus and during the first few weeks of the semester may be accessible&#160;</strong><strong>to &#8220;students only&#8221;</strong> between the hours of 11 a.m. and 2 p.m., Monday - Friday.</li><li><strong>The Dobbs Common Table</strong> menus will continue to be <strong>peanut-free, tree-nut-free, and shellfish-free</strong>.</li><li><strong>Dining will offer mobile ordering for pick-up only</strong> at locations where it is possible and practical.</li><li><strong>Meal swipes may be used</strong> in a to-go format at the Eagle Emporium in the Student Center, the&#160;SAAC, Woodruff Residential Caf&#233;, as well as <strong>other new locations</strong> on campus.</li><li>Dining is working to bring <strong>additional mobile food vendors</strong> to campus during peak lunch hours on&#160;weekdays.</li><li><strong>Vending machines</strong> on campus will <strong>accept Dooley Dollars</strong>.</li></ul><p>Future communications from the Office of Housing Operations will provide additional information&#160;regarding your housing assignment/re-assignment and the move-in process for the fall 2020 semester.</p><p>Please watch your email and regularly visit <a href="https://www.housing.emory.edu" rel="noopener" target="_blank">https://www.housing.emory.edu</a> and&#160;<a href="https://www.emory.edu/dining" rel="noopener" target="_blank">https://www.emory.edu/dining</a> for updates as they become available.</p><p>Sincerely,</p><p>Elaine Turner<br/>Senior Director, Housing Operations</p><p>Dave Furhman<br/>Senior Director, Campus Life Operations</p><div class="clearfix"></div></div></div></td></tr><tr id="message-laney-june-11"><td class="small">

As we have prepared to share this plan with you, we have been heartened by the requests from many in our campus community to reconvene this fall in person. We have heard your hopes and aspirations to have options to return to campus or study remotely and we are confident that this plan allows us to partner with you to work toward these goals.&#160;</p><p>Over the past several months, we have convened leadership across the university, engaged with our leading medical and science experts and consulted federal, state and local health directives to develop a science- and data-based plan that works for Emory. We have made decisions on which we are confident we can deliver, including contingency plans for various scenarios, and that allow us to best serve the academic needs of our students.&#160;</p><p>Our topline decisions are as follows:</p><ul class="list-unordered"><li>We will offer both online and in-person classes this fall, allowing us to provide the excellence of an Emory education to all students.</li><li>The academic calendar will shift to start on August 19, with classes ending by Thanksgiving and exams conducted remotely.</li><li>Residence halls will be open with a standard of no more than two students per room.&#160;</li></ul><p>We want to stress that faculty, staff and students will have options for returning to campus or interacting remotely. Our goal is for everyone to feel comfortable participating in the community and to have options that reflect your preferences for continuing your education, conducting research and teaching, or serving our students. We want to provide options for you to make the best decisions and to have confidence in our planning should you decide to return in person.</p><p>While much will be different this fall, there are core elements of the Emory experience that will remain the same: We will deliver courses that meet Emory&#8217;s rigorous standards and that are taught by our world-renowned faculty, members of the academic campus community will have access to the tremendous resources of our research university, and students will be part of a community known for its support while our students are pursuing degrees with us and throughout their careers. We will deliver an equivalent Emory experience, knowing the necessity of health and safety protocols will prevent us from providing an identical experience to past years.</p><p>One lesson from the current pandemic is that plans must stay flexible to adapt to global, national and regional changes. For this reason, we ask that as you review how we envision the fall experience at this time, you also understand there may be a need for us to pivot our plan to maintain community health and preserve academic continuity. Know we have contingency plans in place should we need them.</p><h2>Fall Classes</h2><p>With faculty, student and staff health and safety as necessary considerations, the academic calendar was modified so that undergraduate classes will begin no later than August 19 and conclude by Thanksgiving, with the final evaluation period conducted remotely. The traditional schedule will be further modified by holding classes on Labor Day and eliminating fall break. Graduate and professional schools may amend this schedule slightly to meet curricular needs. (Note: The calendars for graduate, professional and select undergraduate programs may start a bit earlier or later and include different milestone dates. Please refer to your school&#8217;s website for further details.)</p><p>To maintain choices for our students, Emory will offer expanded online class options that are designed for a comprehensive remote learning experience. For our classroom environments, we will cap most in-person, large lectures to minimize class sizes and to follow physical distancing guidelines. Any rare but essential large lecture classes will be held in facilities that can accommodate appropriate physical distancing measures. It is important to note that we expect students will need to adjust their schedules to accommodate changes in course offerings and formats. Further, we expect that students&#8217; schedules will have either online courses <em>or</em> a mix of in-person and online courses, based on their preference. It may be rare for students to have entirely in-person schedules. Students will receive forthcoming emails explaining the new process and options in detail. Tuition will be applied uniformly regardless of the mix of online and in-person courses as we will provide equivalent experiences regardless of type of delivery.</p><p>We are committed to working with faculty to accommodate their preferred course format and with students to offer courses that meet their preferences and continue their progress toward graduation. Again, our efforts are focused on providing choice while maintaining our community&#8217;s health.</p><p>Please note that strict cleaning protocols for classroom spaces will be implemented. Students will be appropriately spaced in classrooms and will be required to follow protocols for entering/exiting classrooms to avoid overlap with other students.&#160; We will implement multiple measures to ensure cleanliness and safety and will communicate those to the campus community in advance of resumption of courses.</p><h2>Residence Halls</h2><p>Emory and Oxford Colleges are designed to offer residential learning opportunities that are valued by students. Therefore, we will offer on-campus housing options for the fall but will limit dorm room occupancy to two students per room. We will work with students to accommodate single room requests for those who are immunocompromised or have other health considerations. We are also expanding housing options beyond the residence halls to include Emory Conference Center Hotel for Atlanta students, and hotel options for Oxford students. Housing decisions were made after consultation with national housing experts and our own medical and health-based faculty and in accordance with multi-level health directives. As importantly, we know we have the ability, resources and expertise to implement this plan.</p><p>Similar to our planning for classroom and common spaces, we will implement enhanced cleaning protocols, and all residence hall students will be made aware of our shared responsibilities to maintain cleanliness.</p><p>For our students in our residence halls, know that this fall&#8217;s experience will be different. Students may be taking online courses from their rooms, community spaces will have new distancing and restricted occupancy expectations, and we will limit the size of gatherings&#8212;including those held in residence halls&#8212;to maintain a healthy environment.&#160;</p><p>If you are planning to reside in the residence halls this fall, please watch for an email from our housing staff that outlines move-in dates and procedures, fee schedules and policies, additional checklists and considerations, and tools to help with the transition back to campus.</p><h2>Testing, Social Norming and Expectations for Students</h2><p><strong>COVID-19 testing will be mandatory for all students living in residence halls, along with those taking in-person classes, upon or shortly before returning to campus, and will be available at any time during the semester for those who are symptomatic and for their close contacts. Faculty and staff will have access to testing on demand. </strong></p><p>Testing of symptomatic people, as well as those in close contact with people diagnosed with COVID-19, is currently underway on campus and will continue in the fall. Testing, contact tracing, isolation, quarantine, and other measures will be implemented to limit transmission of COVID-19 in our community. We cannot guarantee you will not get sick, but together we can support each other in our academic pursuits, in community and in health.</p><p>All members of the Emory community who come to campus will be required to self-monitor on a daily basis for signs of COVID-19. Trained university staff will conduct random temperature checks across campus each day. Those with fevers will be required to have a clinical evaluation and to be tested, as appropriate.</p><p>We are developing health education programs and materials to ensure community awareness and understanding of indications of illness as well as risks that lead to the spread of the disease. We will also clearly delineate what we expect from members of our community to maintain health and cleanliness standards, including face covering, distancing, cleaning protocols and general health guidance. <strong>Students <em>may not</em> opt out of community expectations for health and safety</strong>&#8212;everyone must participate for our campus community to stay healthy. Further information on testing and community awareness efforts will be sent to you in the coming weeks.</p><h2>Details Still Forthcoming</h2><p>While this letter outlines the broad strokes of what we know, decisions that have been made and health-based protocols, there are still elements we are working through based on a changing virus and world. In addition to adjusting our plan as the external environment may necessitate, we are still working through specific details that are dependent upon how many members of our campus come back in person versus online and how we can safely allow community experiences. These decisions will be based on a scientific review of information and its application to our campus needs so that we can continue to make sound decisions on behalf of our Emory community.</p><p>Additional information will be sent with specifics on social distancing and norming to best reflect growing knowledge of COVID-19 and how it is transmitted. This information will also influence policies regarding campus visitors and decisions about traditions like Family Weekend and Homecoming. Our protocols for cleaning, testing and contact tracing may need to be updated and any changes will be clearly articulated. We have heard requests to retain as much of the college experience as possible and we ask for your understanding as we implement equivalent, but not identical, experiences.</p><h2>Next Steps</h2><p>We know you will have a number of questions about your return online or in person this fall. You will receive communications from additional leaders across campus over the coming days that will provide additional specificity and resources. We apologize for any repetition, but we want all members of the community to make decisions about returning to campus that are in their best interest.</p><p>Ongoing resources will be available on the Emory website. Please bookmark the <span><a href="http://www.emory.edu/forward/index.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Emory Forward page</a></span> for questions or concerns. And please mark your calendar for a campus presentation <span><a href="https://emory.zoom.us/j/95827389617" rel="noopener" target="_blank">today at 4:30 PM</a></span> with President-elect Fenves, Interim Provost Love and Executive Vice Presidents Lewin and Augostini. They will provide further depth on the fall planning details and rationale behind the decisions. In the coming days, deans and additional campus leaders will hold town hall discussions to delineate what the fall decisions mean for their communities. We encourage you to attend and participate. These presentations will be archived on the Emory Forward site, where you can also view a <span><a href="https://vimeo.com/427734407/bea7082b3c" rel="noopener" target="_blank">video message</a></span> from President Sterk.</p><p>In addition, you will receive a survey. <strong>It is critically important that you participate in the survey </strong>as it will help us to make final decisions that need community input and to plan for your return to campus. We want your experience this fall to reflect your preferences, and this will be a critical step in our planning process.&#160;&#160;</p><p>We know that our community wants to be back together on campus and we look forward to welcoming you or introducing ourselves upon your return, too. It will be a different kind of semester, one filled with changes and choices, with new ways to connect and build relationships. But it will still be a uniquely Emory experience. Please look for additional information in the weeks to come and we welcome your feedback and questions.&#160;</p><br/><p>Sincerely,</p><p>Claire E. Sterk, President</p><p>Gregory L.

The plan begins with a return to research at lower density. Over the past month, the various schools and colleges, as well as research, academic, and administrative support units have worked very hard to prepare for the first wave of researchers to return to campus. We want to provide you with an overview of where we are.</p><p>The target date for metered, small-scale research activity to resume is&#160;<strong>May 28, 2020. Only those faculty and staff who are identified as part of the selected research efforts, as well as those who had previously been identified as essential to work on campus, will be approved to return to campus. All others should continue to work remotely. </strong>It is critical to maintain a low density of people on campus at this time to protect the health and safety of those whose work requires them to be on campus. Do not come to campus unless you have received prior approval to do so and have completed the required clearance process described below.&#160;</p><p>Over the next month, other functions and services may also be approved to return. As these plans are completed and if you are needed to return to campus, you will be notified by your supervisor and HR.&#160;</p><p>During the initial ramp up phase, visitors to campus will be prohibited, and our buildings will remain card-access only. Suspension of all university-sponsored travel will remain in effect, except as approved by the Office of the Provost for research purposes.</p><p>Emory is implementing health and safety measures to protect faculty, staff and students who will be returning to work on campus. Each of the individuals who will be working on campus has a critical role to play in keeping the campus safe.&#160;</p><h3>Health and Safety Measures</h3><p>Working with the Office of Critical Event Preparedness and Response (CEPAR), the Environmental Health and Safety Office (EHSO), the Office of Injury Management (OIM), Student Health Services (SHS), Emory Healthcare colleagues, and Emory medical and public health experts, and in compliance with state and local public health and regulatory guidance, Emory has taken a number of actions to protect the health of our community. These actions include:&#160;</p><ul class="list-unordered"><li><span></span>Development of a mandatory confidential screening questionnaire to assess the health of faculty and staff prior to their return to campus.</li><li><span></span>Implementation of mandatory physical distancing, hygiene, and face covering protocols.</li><li><span></span>Implementation of a testing and contact-tracing process with clear guidance for anyone working on campus who develops symptoms of COVID-19.</li><li><span></span>Implementation of random temperature checks.</li><li><span></span>Installation of signage to support physical distancing requirements.</li><li><span></span>Rearrangement of physical spaces, where possible, to support physical distancing.</li><li><span></span>Escalation of frequent cleaning and disinfection of all public spaces, including Emory shuttles.</li><li><span></span>Provision of supplies for cleaning, face coverings, and other necessary PPE.</li></ul><p>It is important to note that maintaining the health and safety of those working on campus is highly dependent on each of us rigorously observing the required individual behaviors. These behaviors are outlined in the <a href="https://hr.emory.edu/eu/_includes/documents/sections/covid19/return-to-campus-guidelines-faculty-staff.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><strong>Return to Campus Guidelines</strong></a>. This guide also contains helpful information about working on campus.</p><p>It is critical that those of us who are returning, and those of us who have already been working regularly on campus, follow certain steps as part of the return process. This requirement applies even if you are only working occasionally on campus. You will receive a separate communication that gives you specific instructions about this, but the required steps include:</p><ul class="list-unordered"><li><span></span>Review and acknowledge an understanding of the expectations and guidelines as you return to campus.</li><li><span></span>Complete necessary training that gives guidance about physical distancing, face covering and other PPE, hygiene, self-monitoring for symptoms, and other important health and safety aspects.</li><li><span></span>Complete a confidential health screening questionnaire online that asks about your exposure to COVID-19, contact with persons who have tested positive, travel, and symptoms.</li><li><span></span>Ensure your mobile phone number is up to date in the Emergency Notification System in PeopleSoft Self Service. If you have not enrolled in the Emergency Notification System, you will be required to do so. <strong>This is a key part of the contact tracing process.</strong></li><li><span></span>Provide a list of &#8220;close contacts&#8221; through a PeopleSoft Self Service module. <strong>This is a key part of the contact tracing process.</strong></li></ul><p>Clearly, we have a shared responsibility for implementing the practices that will support our community&#8217;s safety during the return to research at a lower density. Whether you are returning to campus or continuing to work remotely, we thank you for your commitment to Emory during these challenging times.</p><p><a href="http://www.emory.edu/coronavirus/_includes/documents/sections/messages/return-to-research-all-staff-faculty.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Attachment: Return to Research at Lower Density</a>&#160;</p><div class="clearfix"></div></div></div></td></tr><tr id="message-laney-may-22"><td class="small">

We are writing to provide updates for you on two important matters.</p><p>We know that everyone&#8217;s first question is the status of the fall semester. Answering that question is the focus of our daily work, as we plan for what we hope will be in-person instruction, albeit with many important adaptations and protections in place to prevent the spread of COVID-19 within our community. This work is guided by the <a href="https://www.emory.edu/coronavirus/emory/messages/index.html?m=message-all-principles-decision-making-april-30" rel="noopener" target="_blank">principles for decision making</a> that we discussed during last month&#8217;s town hall. While we would like to share with you a definitive decision about our status for the fall, we are simply not yet prepared to do so and likely cannot for some weeks. However, we commit to providing an update on our progress by June 15.&#160;</p><p>As was shared during last month&#8217;s town hall, we continue to assess the financial impact COVID-19 will have on the university. While we anticipate an approximately $10 million shortfall for our current fiscal year due to lost revenue related to the suspension of mission-related activities, costs related to supporting students&#8217; financial needs, faculty and staff salary continuation, and new incurred COVID-19 related costs, we do not know the full scope of loss for the upcoming fiscal year. As we approach the traditional beginning of the fall semester, we expect a clearer financial picture, but we should not wait any longer to implement additional financial measures that will help mitigate additional losses.&#160;</p><p>In keeping with our decision-making principles, noted above, we are writing today to share the first of what will be several actions in the coming months. <strong>Effective July 1, President Sterk, the President&#8217;s Leadership Team and the deans will reduce their compensation by 15 percent.</strong> This reduction, which will be subject to review at the end of calendar year 2020, is not just a cost-savings step, but also a representation of the commitment the leadership team has to preserving Emory&#8217;s academic and research missions in the face of financial challenges.&#160;</p><p>Thank you for your continued resilience during these uncertain times and for your patience as we thoughtfully and systematically work through many decisions for our Emory community to continue to move forward this Fall.</p><br/><p>Sincerely,&#160;</p><p>Claire E.

I spent much of the weekend signing master&#8217;s theses and doctoral dissertations, and I continue to be moved by the breadth and depth of scholarship produced by Laney Graduate School students. Even in these unspeakable times, graduate students relentlessly push the boundaries of our knowledge in exciting directions.&#160;</p><p>On Friday, May 15, the Office of the Provost released a&#160;<em>Return to Campus for Research Fram</em>e<em>work</em>, a phased plan informed by public health guidance, pragmatism, and caution. If you have not read the document, I urge you to do so.&#160;You will find it <a href="https://www.emory.edu/coronavirus/emory/messages/index.html?m=message-all-phased-return-to-campus-may-15" rel="noopener" target="_blank">here</a>.</p><p>To support this plan, LGS is developing a simple form to be completed by graduate students who decide to return to research facilities that have been approved for re-opening by the appropriate departments, offices, schools, or units. The form will be posted Friday, May 22. &#160;&#160;</p><p>In Phase 2, starting on May 31, once a facility has been approved for limited opening, graduate students will gain access only if their presence is determined to be &#8220;critically necessary to maintain or establish research initiatives related to their academic progress&#8221; by their advisor and Director of Graduate Studies or Program Director. &#160;&#160;</p><p>As Emory evaluates our readiness for Phase 3, on-campus research facilities, including libraries and other areas, may become available to a broader segment of graduate students, insofar as mitigation protocols for different facilities can sustain increased density.&#160;</p><p>Detailed instructions will be available on Friday, May 22, with the form.</p><p>In the meantime, stay in close touch with your advisors and your DGS or PD.

This communication is to let you know that <strong>beginning immediately</strong>, Emory University will commence a multi-phased plan to gradually return to campus for research. As described below, the first phase involves planning at the levels of schools and colleges as well as research support units. Safely resuming additional on-campus and community-based research activities is crucial to our mission to create, preserve, teach, and apply knowledge in the service of humanity. What we learn will inform our decisions about how and when to return to campus for other activities, including teaching and learning.</p><p>Our priority is to protect the health and safety of all members of our community and campus visitors. Our overarching and long-range goals include a return to on-campus, clinical and community-based research, teaching, and learning as soon as it is safe to do so.</p><p>To be clear, <u>our campus is presently a safe place</u>, but higher levels of activity will require implementation of a variety of public health measures that necessitate careful planning and monitoring. We will use all available public health data and guidance as well as data relating specifically to the health and safety of the Emory community to inform decisions and make any necessary updates or adjustments to this plan. <strong>This means that our plans may change. </strong>Circumstances may require us to adjust timelines, change venues, and shift the format of our planned activities, but our priorities, commitments, and values will be unwavering: we <u>will</u> deliver extraordinary educational and research outcomes while implementing the highest standards of care for the well-being of our community.</p><p>The following plan outlines how we will do this <em>together</em>. In making this announcement, we want to underscore what this togetherness entails&#8212;we have a shared responsibility for implementing the practices that will support our collective success.</p><h2>Activities to be supported</h2><p>The return to campus to support research in all its forms&#8212;physical laboratory and non-laboratory (clinical and epidemiological), funded and non-funded, humanistic, creative, and social scientific, as well as libraries and core facilities, and offices both local and global&#8212;must be done gradually and pragmatically based on the best medical, scientific, and public health evidence. It should also be informed by our institutional commitments to support and maintain progress for students and trainees, and to diversity, equity, and inclusion as we make decisions that necessitate prioritization and the exercise of authority and oversight. Re-engagement of research and scholarly activities must also comply with all federal, state, and local laws and regulations and requirements of our accrediting bodies. The larger principles for decision-making that are informing the university return to campus research activity will also guide this effort.&#160;</p><p>Importantly, the COVID-19 pandemic remains dynamic. <strong>All steps in this process are subject to legal and public health contingencies</strong>, such as new governmental restrictions or other public health measures that emerge in response to a resurgence. To support effective communication, necessary collaboration, and clear designation of responsibilities, a return to campus calendar is detailed in the <a href="http://www.emory.edu/coronavirus/emory/research-return/index.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Return to Campus for Research Framework documents</a>, and will be updated and maintained on the university website. Implementation dates and procedures may need to be adapted to fit community- and public health-circumstances. Thus, activities should be resumed with <strong>resilience strategies</strong> in mind to minimize set-backs in the event of revisions to the calendar or process.&#160;</p><p>Resumption of campus- and community-based research activity will be linked with a systematic approach to detecting and controlling the spread of infection in the Emory community. Human Resources (HR) will provide a process to support those with underlying conditions or living situations that put them at greater risk for infection or severe complications from the disease. Those working in clinical partner sites should follow the instructions and requirements for the specific facilities:</p><ul class="list-unordered"><li><a href="http://www.ourehc.org/departments/communicable-diseases/coronavirus.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Emory Healthcare (Login Required)</a></li><li><a href="https://inside.med.emory.edu/administration/grady/about/covid-19.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Grady Health System (Login Required)</a></li><li><a href="https://dvagov.sharepoint.com/sites/atlanta/program/em/SitePages/Home.aspx" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Atlanta VA Health System</a></li><li><a href="https://www.choa.org/covid19forphysicians" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Children&#8217;s Healthcare of Atlanta</a></li></ul><h2>Key strategies</h2><p>A robust practice of health monitoring and testing will be combined with public health guidance for mitigating risk. Data will inform real-time assessment of whether and when to advance in the staged recovery efforts.</p><h2>Phases</h2><p>Progress through phases will be determined by the Office of the Provost in consultation with the Executive Vice President for Health Affairs. Decisions about changes in phases will take into account guidance and data from the CDC and from local public health authorities.</p><p><strong>Phase 1: Preliminary Planning &amp; Assessment of Readiness </strong>(Immediately-May 27)</p><p>Phase 1 involves a review of guidance by the Office of the Provost in the <a href="http://www.emory.edu/coronavirus/emory/research-return/index.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Return to Campus for Research Framework</a>. The various schools and colleges as well as research and academic support units on campus are tasked with preparing unit-specific planning documents to <u>identify faculty, staff and postdoctoral fellows and trainees</u> who will participate in increased activity necessary for the support of research on campus. Among the plans to be developed are those providing for the limited reopening of critical research facilities such as research cores, libraries, the museum, and laboratories.</p><p>While we implement Phase 1, <strong>all faculty and staff who are able to work remotely should continue to do so unless otherwise instructed by their dean, department or program director, or supervisor</strong>. Visitors to campus are prohibited, and our buildings will remain card-access only. Additionally, the suspension of all university-sponsored travel remains in effect.</p><p><strong>Phase 2: </strong><strong>Metered Small-Scale Restart </strong>(May 28-June 21)</p><p>Based on what we learn from Phase 1 and our assessments of operational readiness, we will work to carefully bring back additional personnel to increase capacity and functionality as needed to support core academic operations and related student services. The target date for commencement of this phase is <strong>May 28, 2020</strong>. During this phase, we expect to include, once approved, postdoctoral fellows and trainees as well as graduate students in return to research-related campus activities. <strong>Once again, it will be important for all faculty and staff who are able to work remotely to continue to do so unless otherwise instructed by their dean, department or program director, or supervisor.</strong> It is expected that during this phase, visitors to campus will continue to be prohibited, and our buildings will remain card-access only. Suspension of all university-sponsored travel is expected to remain in effect. The data we collect as part of Phases 1 and 2 will inform our assessments of both the health and safety of the community and our institutional operational capacity to support greater numbers of students, faculty, and staff on campus. What we learn from these two phases will make us more resilient and capable in the months ahead.</p><p><strong>Phase 3: Expansion of Activity </strong>(June 22-date to be determined)</p><p>On or about <strong>June 22, 2020</strong>, we are planning for a <u>metered and monitored</u> re-opening of broader on-campus research activities aligned with university guidelines to maintain a sustainable total population density on campus. Local population densities monitored by local unit leaders, in collaboration as required for shared-use facilities, including:</p><ul class="list-unordered"><li>Faculty (per guidelines from dean/director/chair);</li><li>Staff <u>required</u> on campus to perform their duties;</li><li>Postdocs and related trainees; and</li><li>Graduate and professional students (per guidelines from the Laney Graduate School and relevant dean).</li></ul><p>Once again, <strong>it will be important for all faculty and staff who are able to work remotely to continue to do so unless otherwise instructed by their dean, department or program director, or supervisor. </strong>It is expected that during this phase, visitors to campus will continue to be restricted, and our buildings will remain card-access only. <strong>At this time, we will revisit suspension of university-sponsored travel.</strong></p><p>The Return to Campus for Research Framework was developed through a collaborative and highly consultative process arising from the activities of the Faculty and Research Academic Continuity Group led by Vice Provost for Faculty Affairs Tim Holbrook, and Vice Provost for Strategic Research Initiatives Lanny Liebeskind. We are deeply grateful for their leadership and for the contributions of many others who participated in the planning activities.&#160;</p><p>We will continue to communicate decisions, updates and next steps once available, and thank you for your help in bringing Emory together again.</p><p>Sincerely,</p><p>Jan Love, Interim Provost and Executive Vice President for Academic Affairs&#160;</p><p>Jon Lewin, Executive Vice President for Health Affairs</p><div class="clearfix"></div></div></div></td></tr><tr id="message-all-celebrating-staff-may-13"><td class="small">

They affirm our commitments to compassion, honesty, respect and concern for the greater good, which are rooted within Emory&#8217;s long-standing values.</p><p>The principles include:&#160;</p><ul class="list-unordered"><li>Emory will continue to vigorously pursue our mission to create, preserve, teach and apply knowledge in the service of humanity.</li><li>The health and safety of Emory&#8217;s students, faculty and staff is paramount in moving forward into recovery. We will make decisions based on the best medical, scientific and public health evidence and will be compliant with all federal, state and local laws and regulations and requirements of our accrediting bodies.</li><li>Emory will continue to provide excellent academic offerings, ensure student progress and protect our students&#8217; ability to afford to attend Emory.</li><li>The ability of faculty, staff and students to conduct research and engage in scholarship will be fully supported. Interrupted and suspended activities will resume as soon as it is safe to do so.</li><li>Decisions will be reached in the context of shared governance and through processes that are transparent and collaborative. They will be supported by the best available data and draw upon the considerable expertise and intellectual capital of the university.</li><li>Decisions will allow for flexibility to respond to rapid and perhaps unanticipated changes in circumstances.</li><li>Financial well-being will be assessed with respect to the short-, medium- and long-term impacts on our community <em>and </em>Emory&#8217;s financial health.</li><li>Cost reductions through efficiencies and discretionary spending will be prioritized so as to minimize the impact on employment or compensation of our employees. If reductions affecting employment or compensation become necessary, they will be done in a fair and equitable manner that protects the most vulnerable (lowest paid) populations to the greatest extent possible.</li><li>We will communicate the basis and rationale for decisions to our community.</li></ul><p>While we have been called to make many decisions during this pandemic, one pending decision is the plan for reopening campus this fall. To that end, we assembled a Recovery Implementation Team that is using the principles above to outline solutions for a safe return to campus.</p><p>This process includes a thoughtful review of important elements, including availability for COVID-19 testing, contact tracing procedures, isolation of COVID-19 positive individuals, plans to maximize social distancing and protection for the most vulnerable or for those who could be disproportionately impacted on campus. We will need to have procedures in place to continue physical distancing, oversee cleaning processes, establish universal face covering protocols and adhere to infection prevention strategies to maintain the health and safety of the Emory community.&#160;&#160;</p><p>Our planning scenarios outline options for both in-person and remote learning modules as well as a combination of the two and are designed to dynamically adapt to public health guidelines and safety recommendations. However, there are still many variables to be considered for a fall reopening and many questions that need to be answered before we can release a definitive plan. We will communicate a decision and share what this means for the Emory community once important information is collected and analyzed, and a plan is developed for our community.&#160;</p><p>While we thank you for your patience and understanding during this time, we also charge the entire Emory community &#8212; faculty, staff and students &#8212; to be imaginative and innovative as we work on creative and flexible solutions to meet our collective needs. It is certainly in Emory&#8217;s nature to be optimistic, and it is through interdisciplinary thought and courageous action that we can keep our community safe and healthy.&#160;</p><br/><p>Sincerely,</p><p>Jan Love, Interim Provost and Executive Vice President for Academic Affairs</p><p>Christopher L.

But for everyone, this year has posed challenges unlike anything we&#8217;ve ever before experienced, as our spring semester was disrupted by a global pandemic.</p><p>We want to acknowledge the remarkable resilience demonstrated by students, faculty and staff in adapting to significant changes, including an abrupt transition to online education.&#160;</p><p>Our students had to adjust to a new way of learning in a very different environment. Faculty members swiftly pivoted to remote teaching, and across campus, staff members coordinated the technology and training needed to make it all work. Together, you&#8217;ve tackled these changes with creativity, talent and resolve. For that, we thank you.</p><p>This is a very different kind of semester. Students may be feeling anxious about online tests or studying under stressful conditions at home without the convenience and reassurances of in-person study groups. They may be missing friends or finding it hard to concentrate and stay motivated. Meanwhile, faculty and staff are balancing their Emory-related responsibilities with additional demands at home as they care for family members and, in many cases, invest considerable time in their own children&#8217;s remote learning. We&#8217;re all juggling a lot and experiencing increased stress and anxiety.</p><p>There are people and services here to help you make it through what has, for everyone, been an incredibly difficult time.&#160;</p><p>If you are a student feeling stressed and unmotivated, please don&#8217;t hesitate to reach out to faculty members or academic advisors to answer questions, to better understand your academic support options.

Many of us have become newly acquainted with public health terminology, and extraordinary measures such as quarantine, stay-at-home orders, and physical distancing have clarified just how interconnected our lives &#8212; and our health &#8212; really are. Many of us have also experienced uncertainty the likes of which we might never have imagined. We all want to know<span>&#160;</span><em>how</em><span>&#160;</span>and<span>&#160;</span><em>when</em><span>&#160;</span>it will end, and we all want to bring a semblance of order, predictability and regularity to our lives.<span>&#160;</span></p><p>Since early February, the Office of the Provost, working with colleagues throughout the university, has been laser-focused on the spread of COVID-19, its impacts on our community, and the forms of support our students, faculty, and staff need as we do our part to respond and seek to flatten the curve.</p><p>This required many decisions and rapid actions, including:</p><ul class="list-unordered"><li>Implementing remote learning for 4,239 classes taught by 1,662 professors;</li><li>Supporting thousands of employees in transitioning to remote working;</li><li>Developing a pandemic mitigation plan that resulted in ramping down and redirecting all but critical activities in our nearly $690 million research operation;</li><li>Recalling more than 150 undergraduate students from study abroad;</li><li>Helping 4,100 students move out of the residence halls;</li><li>Accommodating and relocating more than 300 students, including 49 from our Oxford campus, who were unable to return home before the end of the semester to the Clairmont campus;</li><li>Issuing student credits for housing, dining, and fees totaling nearly $14 million;</li><li>Providing students with lump sum payments of nearly $400,000 for federal work study, and paying non-federal work-study student employees $1,075,197 for anticipated on campus work contributions;</li><li>Providing $1.55 million in cash stipends to undergraduate students with the greatest financial need;</li><li>Disbursing $2.2 million to graduate and undergraduate students through the<span>&#160;</span><span>EmoryTogether</span><span>&#160;</span>fund, processing more than 6,000 requests for aid; and we expect to process another 1,000 applications for assistance;</li><li>Creating a<span>&#160;</span><a href="https://emory.sharepoint.com/sites/DUC" rel="noopener" target="_blank">virtual community hub</a><span>&#160;</span>to pull together ways that students can connect online with old friends, make new friends and take care of themselves and others;</li><li>Treating more than 700 student patients in student health services, and preparing a secondary facility in the event of a surge in illness;</li><li>Adapting grading policies for students, and extending the tenure clocks for faculty;</li><li>Combatting health stigmatization and racism by reaffirming and communicating our core values;</li><li>Aligning academic affairs, health sciences, and business administration to effectively manage our resources with the greatest of care so that we can be in the strongest possible position for the fall.&#160; &#160;&#160;&#160;</li></ul><p>Alongside all this activity, we have been planning for the future by drawing on the expertise of our world-renown and pioneering faculty in public health. We are assessing the capacities of our extraordinary health care system, learning from our peers, and consulting our partners at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the CDC.<span>&#160;</span></p><p>The outstanding question on the minds of all of us at Emory<span>&#160;</span><em>is what will happen in the fall?</em><span>&#160;</span>We don&#8217;t have a decision for you just yet. However, we do want you to know that we are working on a plan for the coming academic year, and we thought you might appreciate more insight into the process and framework we&#8217;re using to reach decisions.<span>&#160;</span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</p><p>The health and safety of our students, faculty, and staff is paramount. And we&#8217;ll settle for nothing less than excellence in the arenas of teaching and learning. Colleagues from across the university have been meeting in teams with leaders from each and every school and college, including Campus Life, Campus Services, Occupational Safety, Research Administration, Student Health, General Counsel, Communications and Public Affairs, Business Affairs, Enrollment Services, Admissions, Financial Aid, the Registrar&#8217;s Office, and Procurement to tackle problems and rapidly identify possible solutions.<span>&#160;</span>&#160;</p><p>Together with<span>&#160;</span><a href="https://emergency.emory.edu/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">CEPAR</a>, we are drawing on all of these insights and operational expertise to develop a plan that will allow us to deliver on our academic mission, maintain standards, support path-breaking research, and advance the priorities of the university.<span>&#160;</span>&#160;</p><p>All of us want to be together again to study and learn, explore and share just as soon as it safe for us to do so. We all want a return to life on campus, to classrooms and residence halls, libraries and labs, and clinical placements.<span>&#160;</span><em>When</em><span>&#160;</span>might we do so?<span>&#160;</span><em>How</em><span>&#160;</span>can we best support a healthy campus? These are among the many factors we are integrating in our planning.<span>&#160;</span>&#160;</p><p>As we do this work, we&#8217;re inspired by the creativity, commitment, and resolve of our community. We<span>&#160;</span><strong><em>will</em></strong><span>&#160;</span>get through this together. Moreover, we are confident that &#8212; because of the efforts of so many &#8212; we are building an Emory that is even more capable and adaptive to change. That resilience will serve us well in both the short- and the long-term.<span>&#160;</span>&#160;</p><p>Thank you for your patience as we explore what&#8217;s possible. Our resolve remains to &#8220;create, preserve, teach, and apply knowledge in the service of humanity.&#8221; And that mission matters now more than ever.&#160;&#160;<span>&#160;</span></p><p>Sincerely,<span>&#160;</span></p><p>Christa<span>&#160;</span><span>Acampora</span>, Deputy Provost for Academic Affairs</p><p><span>Enku</span><span>&#160;</span><span>Gelaye</span>, Vice President and Dean of Campus Life</p><p class=" inline-styles text-center">Please visit the<span>&#160;</span><a href="http://www.emory.edu/coronavirus/emory/faq/academic-continuity.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Academic Continuity page</a><span>&#160;</span>on<span>&#160;</span><a href="https://www.emory.edu/coronavirus/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Emory&#8217;s Coronavirus website</a><span>&#160;</span>for additional information.</p><div class="clearfix"></div></div></div></td></tr><tr id="message-college-grading-update"><td class="small">

The feedback you have provided has been instrumental during this transition. In addition to the upcoming university-wide town hall, LGS will host virtual conversations with students after the spring term ends.<strong>&#160;</strong></p><h2>Academic Progress</h2><p>We have asked programs to be as flexible as possible regarding degree requirements, such as qualifying exams and defenses. LGS will also offer flexibilities for policies and deadlines related to leave of absence, candidacy, and degree completion.</p><p>We understand that restricted access to laboratories, libraries, museums, fieldwork sites, and other research resources will delay progress for many students. We also recognize that these issues are complex and that it may take time both to assess obstacles and to adapt plans. We are working with Directors of Graduate Studies and Program Directors to address these needs.</p><h2>Financial Support</h2><p>We know that you are concerned about funding support. We remain steadfast in fulfilling our commitments in the form of stipends, admissions fellowships, tuition scholarships, health insurance subsidies, back-up care, PDS funds, awards, and advanced fellowships. If you have immediate needs related to your individual funding situation, please let your advisor and Director of Graduate Studies/Program Director know as soon as possible.</p><p>For the summer 2020 term, LGS students will not be responsible for paying student fees (Enrollment, Computing, Mental Health, Athletics, and Activity Fees).

We understand and share in your sense of loss not only for the formal Commencement festivities, but also for the very personal farewell and &#8220;thank you&#8221; moments with friends, faculty, mentors, and staff. While these in-person moments will have to wait for another day, we are eager to join your family and friends in celebrating the extraordinary accomplishments of your class in May.</span></p><p><span>Over the past few weeks, a Commencement Task Force has gathered invaluable ideas and input from students, faculty, staff, and alumni. Students specifically &#8212; both undergraduate and graduate &#8212; were integral in guiding the final decisions and shared valuable feedback regarding key aspects of the traditional event they hold most dear. The goal was to create meaningful experiences that honor some of our beloved Commencement traditions and invite your voices to be part of the celebration in a way that can be preserved and cherished for years to come. </span></p><p><span>In addition to the individual school events, a new interactive website will launch on May 4, to allow the entire community &#8212; family, friends, faculty members, staff, alumni and students &#8212; to honor graduates through uploaded messages, photos, and videos celebrating both your time within the Emory community and your induction as our newest alumni class. One website example is the &#8220;Y/our Moment,&#8221; a short film that helps tell the story of the Class of 2020 from your perspective and that of your faculty. These videos, along with many other ceremonial and celebratory pieces, will be featured on the website and shareable with your network of friends and family.</span></p><p><span>We hope that you will take the time to engage in these interactive opportunities and add your personal thoughts and memories. Throughout the week of May 4, several other events will be featured on the site including Class Day and Baccalaureate presentations. Oxford College and several of Emory&#8217;s schools will host unique live and recorded award presentations and ceremonies, all leading up to the special events on May 11 when your degrees will be conferred (Oxford will be conferred on May 9). One special opportunity on that day will be an interactive address from our 2020 Commencement speaker, <a href="https://eji.org/bryan-stevenson/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Bryan Stevenson</a>, acclaimed human rights lawyer, activist, founder, and executive director of the Montgomery, Alabama-based Equal Justice Initiative.</span></p><p><span>Rest assured, Emory plans to invite graduates from the class of 2020 back to campus to gather, celebrate, and be recognized with family and friends. In today&#8217;s uncertain environment, we do not know the date that may be possible or exactly what the Commencement celebrations will look like &#8212;but we are committed to figuring out a path forward with you, Class of 2020. We know how important this is to so many of you and acknowledge the challenges that segments of the class may face in attending a future event on campus. The feedback of student representatives has been a critical part of the Commencement planning process and will remain so as we plan for these celebrations.</span></p><p><span>In the meantime, we hope that these special Commencement activities, both university-wide and from your schools, will provide a real sense of completion and acknowledgement of a job well done under extraordinary circumstances. You&#8217;ve earned it, and we cannot wait to share in these experiences with you. We applaud your accomplishments, and look forward to joining you online soon, and in-person very soon.</span></p><br/><p><span>Sincerely,</span></p><p><span>Claire E.

It&#8217;s within those moments that we find individuals who support the greater good. While examples of such service can be found in every corner of our campus and health care communities, we particularly want to acknowledge the creativity, patience and determination that have been demonstrated by our Emory students.</p><p>Graduate and undergraduate students at Emory&#8217;s Atlanta and Oxford College campuses have worked with other graduate and undergraduate students, staff, faculty and administrators to create new systems and portals and to identify resources that have helped make our new model work.</p><p>Even amid the disruptions of packing to leave campus and adjust to remote learning, Emory students helped one another. During last month&#8217;s move-out, the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/EmoryUniversitySGA/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Emory Student Government Association</a> (SGA) quickly arranged free MARTA passes to help with transportation needs and collected and shared student concerns about remote learning. At the same time, the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/emorycollegecouncil/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Emory College Council</a> shifted to public online meetings and produced COVID-19-specific resources.&#160;</p><p>The <a href="https://www.facebook.com/EmoryGSGA/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Emory Graduate Student Government Association</a> (GSGA) has provided a range of resources, including sharing virtual fitness, health and wellness activities via social media; hosting a weekly online &#8220;Quarantine Quiz Show;&#8221; and facilitating discussions about ways to create and maintain a sense of community online. GSGA has maintained open lines of communication with each division to keep abreast of the remote student experience and related needs.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.facebook.com/emoryoxfordsga/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Oxford SGA</a> also played a driving role in providing support and secured free boxes for students who returned to campus to pack up their rooms, while Oxford student residence life staff offered hands-on help to pack belongings for the transition to remote learning. Using social media, the Oxford SGA also launched a spotlight series to illustrate how students are managing the call for physical distancing.</p><p>And as everyone has settled into a new online learning, graduate and undergraduate governance on both campuses opened new avenues for student involvement, moving governance meetings online, hosting virtual town halls and providing digital voting options for this month&#8217;s regularly scheduled elections.</p><p>When students choose Emory, we know that they bring with them exceptional qualities, including leadership skills, creative minds, a desire to serve others, and an appreciation for the rewards that come from hard work.</p><p>During these challenging times, it has been inspiring to see these skills applied to the larger good. From a grateful community, please know that your investments in supporting Emory are both acknowledged and deeply appreciated.</p><br/><p>Sincerely,&#160;</p><p>Jan Love, Interim Provost and Executive Vice President for Academic Affairs</p><p>Christopher L.

You will receive an email next week once all synchronous course times have been updated.

If you are no longer interested in being enrolled in a course as it transitions to an online format, you may drop the course via OPUS.<br/></span></p><p><span>If your on-campus course is not transitioning to the online format, it will be cancelled, and you will receive an email notification to that effect. This will be rare, as most planned on-campus summer courses are transitioning to online.<br/></span></p><p><span>Please note that all online summer courses will follow the Emory College Online format, which means that:</span></p><ul class="list-unordered"><li><span>All courses will include a combination of required synchronous sessions and asynchronous course content.

As we approach the end of the academic year, I wanted to provide you with updates on two important decisions so that you can plan accordingly for both summer and fall semesters. The health and safety of our students, faculty and staff remain our top priority and guide our decision-making process.&#160;</p><p><strong><u>First, an update on summer academic programming at Emory</u></strong>:<span>&#160;</span><strong>To protect public health and minimize risks for disruption, Emory University will offer only summer programming that can be completed off-campus and in remote learning formats.</strong><span>&#160;</span>Information about online programming for the summer is available through your school registrar and on the<span>&#160;</span><a href="https://atlas.emory.edu/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Course Atlas website</a>. Many of Emory&#8217;s summer offerings were specifically designed for online learning and are routinely offered in that format. If you were considering enrolling in summer courses, I encourage you to review these offerings, connect with your advisor if necessary, and complete your summer registration by the deadline established by your school or program.<span>&#160;</span>&#160;</p><p>As&#160;<a href="https://news.emory.edu/stories/2020/03/coronavirus_remote_learning/campus.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">previously announced</a>, residential learning has been suspended for the remainder of the semester. Emory transitioned to remote learning for graduate and undergraduate classes on Monday, March 23. All university-sponsored events and gatherings of any size are indefinitely suspended.</p><p>All university events and gatherings, both on and off campus, should shift to virtual venues or be postponed. If essential, brief meetings may be held in spaces large enough to accommodate appropriate social distancing.&#160;</p><p>Also, Emory made the difficult but necessary decision to&#160;<a href="https://www.emory.edu/coronavirus/emory/messages/index.html?m=message-all-spring-commencement-march-18" rel="noopener" target="_blank">cancel Commencement exercises</a> planned for May. We realize that this is enormously disappointing, but this was the one option that ensures the safety and well-being of our Emory community members in the face of the spread of COVID-19. Planning is already underway to celebrate and commemorate the Class of 2020 later in the year, once we are able to do so safely. More information will be shared as these plans proceed.<span>&#160;</span></p><p><strong><u>Second, an update on the status of undergraduate study abroad programs for fall 2020</u>: University-sponsored study abroad for undergraduate students in fall 2020 is canceled.</strong><span>&#160;</span>We have made this difficult and disappointing decision based on the health and safety concerns associated with global and domestic travel and the uncertainty of conditions in various countries abroad. These considerations are also combined with concerns about the stability and resilience of the sponsoring organizations responsible for providing a quality experience that would allow students to achieve their academic and personal goals.&#160;</p><p>For those of you who were planning on a study abroad experience this fall, I know this is difficult news to hear. While the uncertainty surrounding COVID-19 makes planning for fall difficult, know that as we work to provide a year of rich learning experiences for students during the 2020-21 academic year, we will strive to create new and unique travel and study opportunities for students.</p><p>I remain profoundly impressed by the resilience, patience and understanding shown by the Emory community as we all adjust to the many changes being forced upon us by COVID-19.

The new deadline is April 27. After this date you will be able to petition to change the grading basis. All of the details can be found in the email we sent you, or by <a href="https://collegeconnect.emory.edu/portal/viewemail?m_guid=795544a6-4a04-49e1-8d3b-0a4795f014a0" rel="noopener" target="_blank">clicking here</a>.&#160;</p><h2>Advising Walk-In Hours</h2><p>In addition to our regular advising appointments, our advising team is offering virtual walk-in hours until the end of semester.

Join EPASS for a Remote Learning virtual coaching group. In this collaborative group, you&#8217;ll share ideas with a small group of your peers, create weekly action plans, and learn success strategies to help you finish strong this semester.

Be cautious as you interact and collaborate with others, or when you discuss or share your own work or the work of others. Please take a moment to review the Emory College Honor Code&#8217;s Appendix 3: Academic Misconduct in the Remote Learning Environment. Be mindful as you navigate remote teaching and learning as the new normal for the remainder of the semester. Most importantly, if you are in doubt about whether your actions may be problematic, you should contact your professor directly for clarification.</p><h2>Pre-Registration</h2><p>Pre-Registration continues this week for Emory College students. This week, students with 45+ earned hours will enroll. Please note that earned hours only includes courses that you have already completed. Hours that you are currently enrolled in this semester are <strong>NOT</strong> included in this count.</p><p>In preparation for pre-registration we encourage you to:</p><p>Review your enrollment times in <a href="https://opus.emory.edu/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">OPUS</a></p><p>Schedule an advising appointment with your major or pre-major faculty advisor. If you are not sure who your advisor is, their name and email address can be found in OPUS.</p><p>Visit the <a href="https://atlas.emory.edu/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">University Course Atlas</a> to explore courses for the Fall 2020 semester&#160;</p><p>With pre-registration underway, here is part 2 of our Cool Courses feature. This feature is designed to highlight interesting opportunities, open to Emory College students, for credit. These are courses which typically have no pre-requisites.</p><h2>BUS 499: Design Thinking</h2><p>Do you want to learn a powerful approach for developing practical, creative solutions to real-world, messy, wicked problems? At its core, design thinking uses the mindset and methods of design practitioners to identify and address human needs by developing functional and emotionally meaningful products, services, processes, and spaces that address those needs. This highly experiential course, taught by Prof Jan Barton, is open to all Emory students, regardless of degree or major.</p><p>Through short lectures and guided teamwork, you will learn a design thinking framework and a set of tools to help you navigate ambiguity, improve your ability to empathize with others, integrate diverse preferences and points of view, reframe challenges, ideate creative solutions, develop a &#8220;just-try-it&#8221; mindset for rapid experimentation, and enhance your presentation skills with storytelling and graphic design elements. You will showcase your learning in a final project addressing one of Emory&#8217;s current strategic challenges.</p><h2>REL 200R: LGBTQ Religion &amp; Spirituality</h2><p>Rather than asking what religious traditions say about sexuality and gender, this course will focus on what LGBTQ-identified people have had to say about religion and spirituality, exploring their cultural agency and creativity. Here are a few examples of topics we will explore: the identification of the assassinated gay activist and politician, Harvey Milk, as "Saint Harvey Milk" by some LGBTQ people; lesbian feminist embodied goddess spirituality; the Radical Faeries movement; the Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence order of "queer nuns"; the spiritual dimensions of Native American "Two-Spirit" identities; LGBTQ-affirming expressions of Pentecostal Christianity; LGBTQ atheism. The course will include site-visits, participant observation in cultural events, and guest speakers representing a variety of groups and communities.</p><div class="clearfix"></div></div></div></td></tr><tr id="message-all-commitment-to-belonging-april-6"><td class="small">

As our community has shifted to distance learning and remote work in many areas, and the rate of cases in Georgia rapidly increases, it has become clear that it will be difficult for Emory to maintain an accurate count of members of our community who are diagnosed as positive for COVID-19. For this reason, we have revised our approach to reporting confirmed cases and will no longer send announcements about illnesses on campus.&#160;For the most accurate and up-to-date information <strong>about COVID-19 in Georgia or Metro Atlanta</strong>, please refer to the <a href="https://dph.georgia.gov/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Georgia Department of Health</a> and the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a> for COVID-19 tracking. Our commitment to the health and safety of our community is unwavering as we continue to work closely with local and state health partners to monitor and manage COVID-19 and address its impact on our community.</p><p>Leadership in Academic Affairs and Business Administration is currently working with schools and units to define essential activities on campus and provide guidance to both faculty and staff. We will focus our attention on around-the-clock actions to protect students, faculty, and staff who remain&#160;on campus. If your function is deemed essential and you are required to come to campus but feel you are in a high-risk group due to your age or a medical condition, please talk to your supervisor or HR representative for working options.</p><h2>In the event of illness</h2><ul class="list-unordered"><li><strong>If you are a student who has relocated out of Atlanta</strong>, and have become symptomatic (<em>fever &gt;100F, cough, shortness of breath, sore throat</em>), call your primary care provider.</li><li><strong>If you are a student on campus or in the Atlanta area</strong>, please access the <a href="http://studenthealth.emory.edu/hs/about/patient_portal.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Student Health Patient Portal</a>, message the &#8220;COVID Assessment Provider,&#8221; and notify Student Health Services.

So that we may understand critical workforce needs, it is very important for you to indicate your use of sick leave in the Exempt Leave Tracking or Time and Attendance System. After illness, the <a href="https://www.hr.emory.edu/eu/wellness/general-health/occupational-injury-management/index.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Office of Injury Management (OIM)</a> can help assess an employee&#8217;s readiness to return to work.</li><li><strong>If you are faculty or staff and concerned you have been exposed</strong> to someone with COVID-19, call the Emory Healthcare hotline: <a href="tel:404-712-6843">404-71-COVID</a> (<a href="tel:404-712-6843">404-712-6843</a>), where you can be connected with a nurse for guidance.

We will count on alumni to support students now and in the future, demonstrating the strength of the Emory family.&#160;</p><p>We are committed too, to supporting you all as you navigate an unprecedented situation for your lives, careers, and families.

Your student will likely have attended their first online session. Our faculty are working hard to make this a great experience for your student. If your student has any issues with their course work, or connecting via remote technology, please ask them to reach out to their faculty members in the first instance.</p><h2>Course Grading</h2><p>Your student has received information on grading for this semester. We are offering students the option to change their grading basis from a letter grade to satisfactory/unsatisfactory, to petition for a late, single, course withdrawal without penalty or to request incomplete grades. Each option carries potential benefits and consequences and our advising team is available to meet virtually with students to discuss individual situations. We know that this is an unusual situation and we are working to offer practical solutions to the challenges we know that some students are facing.</p><h2>Commencement 2020</h2><p>It is with great sorrow that the University has had to cancel our Commencement exercises in May 2020. I want to underscore that we are proud of all our graduating students and, as Dean Elliott noted in a message to them directly, will find a way to honor and celebrate all that they have accomplished at another time in the future. While those plans are still being formulated, we will keep your student updated. We look forward to celebrating them appropriately soon.</p><p>As always, my team is available to answer any questions or concerns that you might have.

That swift transition represents a cultural sea change from our normal academic routines and campus operations, and its success is due, in no small part, to each and every one of you.&#160;</p><p>Congratulations on embracing the rapid changes necessary to keep our learning channels &#8212; and our community &#8212; strong, stable and functional.</p><p>For some of us, learning and working online will be familiar. For others, it may represent a first-time experience. Together, we are making it work &#8212; every day, finding our way forward. And with each success, both large and small, our confidence and resolve is strengthened.</p><p>We recognize that the rough edges of this transition have been smoothed by the dedication of many, many individuals, whose tireless, behind-the-scenes efforts have helped keep the very machinery of Emory humming. Our deepest thanks goes out to all Emory students, faculty and staff for the hard work, long hours and resilience you&#8217;ve demonstrated in going the extra mile to make this possible. It has been an extraordinary effort.</p><p>As we continue adapting to change, an important reminder: For students, faculty and staff who remain on campus, starting this week all&#160;Atlanta and Oxford campus buildings will be secured and only&#160;<a href="http://www.campserv.emory.edu/covid19/epd-response.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">accessible</a> with&#160;an active Emory ID card.&#160;This security measure is necessary for protection of personnel and property as a result of changes to the campus operating environment&#160;due to&#160;COVID-19.&#160;&#160;</p><p>Amid these new developments, we also want to acknowledge important, long-standing traditions here at Emory. As we move together as a community through this spring semester &#8212; always a time of growth and renewal &#8212; we&#8217;re also preparing to welcome our newest cohort of student scholars, the Class of 2024.</p><p>The evening of Wednesday, March 25, our final round of admitted first-year students will receive their eagerly awaited confirmation emails, inviting them to join the Emory community. It&#8217;s not hard for students to recall the anticipation you may have felt as a high school senior awaiting that notification as you decided where to enroll. We absolutely share in that excitement.</p><p>We also want to recognize the important work being done by teams at the Office of Admission on the Atlanta campus and the Office of Enrollment Services on the Oxford campus to share admissions information with prospective Emory students. In the days ahead, those offices will continue working diligently to provide new remote opportunities for future Eagles to connect with current students, faculty, and staff.&#160;</p><p>For the latest developments in our new normal together, we invite you to check out the recently relaunched <a href="https://www.emory.edu/coronavirus/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Emory COVID-19 website</a>, which now features information organized to provide quick answers for faculty, staff and students, including important resources for remote learning and working.&#160;</p><p>Thank you for standing with Emory as we face our shared challenges &#8212; honoring the past, while building toward the future.&#160;</p><p>Sincerely,&#160;</p><p>Jan Love, Interim Provost and Executive Vice President for Academic Affairs</p><p>Christopher L.

While that will necessarily bring changes, it won&#8217;t deter our mission to create and share knowledge, and it will not break our sense of community.</p><p>While the changes we are experiencing may feel isolating and even overwhelming, in a remarkable way they have also brought us closer together, as we navigate this shared experience. And there are parts of the Emory experience that will not change. Emory faculty remain among the very best in their fields, with the resources and creativity to deliver an exceptional learning experience. Our talented staff remain dedicated to our mission and service to our students. And the resiliency of our student body is inspiring. Thank you to everyone for your contributions to our community.</p><p>For everyone, confronting COVID-19 requires a big adjustment. But as you grapple with new challenges, please know that you are not alone &#8212; resources are available, along with people eager to help, even from afar.</p><p>We encourage everyone to prioritize their mental health and wellbeing in the coming days and weeks.

Get some fresh air, take a walk, get some exercise &#8212;all of which can be accomplished while maintaining social distancing. We are impressed with the many ways our students are maintaining relationships across the miles, and are hard at work to provide additional opportunities to connect and maintain the heart of Emory, even at a distance.&#160;</p><p>For those students, staff and faculty who must remain on campus, we ask you to continue exercising care and compassion by <strong>practicing social distancing</strong>. That includes avoiding gatherings of more than 10 people and remaining six feet apart at all times. Under these federal recommendations, parties and large social gatherings are discouraged at this time.&#160;</p><p>To support security and social distancing measures, Emory&#8217;s Atlanta and Oxford College campuses have made adjustments to operating structures, which include campus building closures and reduced hours of operation and summer program cancellations:</p><h2>Atlanta and Oxford Campus</h2><h3>Building Security and Access</h3><p>Beginning Monday, March 23, all <strong>Atlanta and Oxford campus buildings will be secured and will only be accessible </strong><strong>with an active Emory ID card</strong>.&#160;This security measure is necessary for protection of personnel and property as a result of changes to the campus operating environment due to COVID-19.&#160; While most faculty, staff and students have active Emory ID cards that will permit access to their buildings, we anticipate some may not.&#160;Those who lack required building access should coordinate access with your department and the EmoryCard office.&#160;Questions may be directed to: <a href="mailto:emorycard@emory.edu">emorycard@emory.edu</a>. Additional information about pop-up EmoryCard Office access will be provided in a separate communication.</p><h2>Atlanta Campus</h2><h3>Closed or Reduced Hours of Operation</h3><ul class="list-unordered"><li>Currently closed: Woodruff P.E. Center, Student Activity &amp; Academic Center (excepting mail and dining), Emory Student Center, Alumni Memorial University Center, Schwartz Center for Performing Arts, Carlos Museum, Woodruff Library, Barnes &amp; Noble</li><li>Reduced hours: Dining hall hours will vary. Visit the <a href="https://www.emory.edu/dining/">Dining website</a> for updated hours and availability.</li><li>Boxed food options: For those remaining on the Druid Hills campus,&#160;boxed meals can be picked up in the Dobbs Common Table in the Emory Student Center at the hours indicated on the <a href="https://www.emory.edu/dining/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Dining website</a>.</li></ul><h3>Parking and Transportation&#160;</h3><p>Beginning Friday, March 20, until further notice, the parking decks listed below will have free entry/exit for use by Emory and Emory Healthcare personnel who are considered essential.&#160;This change in parking policy is provided to support social distancing during the COVID-19 campus operating environment.&#160;Email any parking questions to <a href="mailto:parking@emory.edu">parking@emory.edu</a>.

Emory also encourages&#160;faculty and staff responsible for organizing any&#160;Summer 2020&#160;Emory-sponsored international travel for&#160;graduate or professional students, either group or individual, to&#160;reconsider&#160;their plans, as such travel may not be allowed&#160;given the&#160;uncertain duration&#160;of the international travel suspension.</p><p>This decision is being made in light of Emory&#8217;s international travel suspension and the possibility that planned summer travel could be disrupted by potential entry restrictions by the U.S. and other countries.&#160;Moreover, as Emory and its partners and colleagues abroad focus on their COVID-19 response, preparations that would normally be made to ensure safe and meaningful academic experiences abroad cannot be effectively executed.</p><p>Students who have been planning Emory-sponsored travel should work with their units on any logistical or administrative issues resulting from this cancelation, such as the refund of paid deposits.&#160;Emory understands the importance of summer experiences abroad to students&#8217; Emory program and remains committed to working with them to ensure academic continuity during this challenging time.</p><p>As we continue to respond to the unprecedented impact of this historic COVID-19 pandemic, we remain inspired and grateful for your help in facing change together. We encourage you to be patient next week with the faculty as we launch our courses remotely, with our staff as we implement new technology, and with each other as we find our new normal.&#160;</p><p>The strength of our combined efforts today will go far in protecting the health and safety of everyone in the days to come. We can all play a role in helping turn the tide of this ongoing public health crisis.

Some classes may be synchronous (real time as listed on OPUS, Eastern Standard Time). Others may be fully asynchronous (without real-time interaction). Some classes may have both synchronous and asynchronous elements.&#160;</p><h2>2. What if I have not heard from my faculty member by the deadline?</h2><p>Please wait until the deadline has elapsed. Faculty may need every moment to prepare and communicate their plans for this major transition. After that, please contact Oxford College&#8217;s Associate Dean for Academic Affairs, Valerie Molyneaux, for assistance (<a href="mailto:vmolyne@emory.edu">vmolyne@emory.edu</a>).&#160;</p><h2>3. How can I prepare for remote (online) learning?</h2><p>If you have not already done so, please complete the Oxford College <a href="https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=nPsE4KSwT0K80DImBtXfOK5PEkOYj4dHkdOxwhAXxalURFREQlQ4QlA3RDExV0czNkMyV05ESlNGRi4u" rel="noopener" target="_blank">remote learning survey</a>. <em>Oxford College Information Technology is using survey responses to support students who report access difficulties or barriers, so please complete the survey to allow us to support you through this period of remote learning.</em></p><p>As possible, establish a secure internet connection. Gather trouble-shooting information, such as passwords and internet provider customer service contact information.&#160; Test your equipment, making sure that you can see and be seen through your camera, and hear and be heard through your speaker(s) and microphone. Zoom, Emory&#8217;s telecommunication platform, offers a <a href="https://zoom.us/test" rel="noopener" target="_blank">test meeting site</a> to check your equipment.&#160; Oxford also has <a href="http://oxford.emory.edu/remotework" rel="noopener" target="_blank">resources and support for remote learning</a>.&#160;</p><p>Remote (online) learning will present new challenges. Daily log-ins to Canvas, even for asynchronous courses; close and careful reading of class communications (ideally on a computer screen, not just a phone); a regular study routine (ideally in a distraction-free space reserved for study); and connecting virtually with faculty and classmates can all help.</p><h2>4. Can I use Oxford/Emory library materials?</h2><p>Access to Emory University databases, eJournals, and our large collection of digital books and reference tools will continue to be available online. Please see the <a href="https://guides.libraries.emory.edu/remotestudent" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Remote Library Resources and Services Guide</a> for details about accessing these resources. Contact the Oxford Library at 770.784.8380, through email at ox-librarystaff@listserv.cc.emory.edu, or through the chat widget on the Oxford Library homepage.</p><p>Please watch EaglePost for an announcement from your Oxford College Library about expanded access to online textbook/ course materials from select publishers.</p><h2>5. How will I register for fall classes?</h2><p>Due to extended Spring Break, the timeline for Fall 2020 pre-registration has delayed one week. Official enrollment appointments will be updated by Wednesday, March 18 in OPUS. If you have questions about enrollment or registration, please contact the Advising Support Center (<a href="mailto:oxadvising@emory.edu">oxadvising@emory.edu</a>).&#160;</p><p><em>As of Tuesday, March 17, 2020, no changes or decisions have yet been announced regarding whether summer and future semesters will be offered remotely or in person. At this time, we are planning for regular operations; all updates will be communicated to students, faculty, and staff by the Office of the Provost.</em>&#160;</p><h2>6. How will I participate in academic advising?</h2><p>Rising second-year students (Oxford Class of 2021): work directly with your faculty advisor. If you have not heard from your advisor by March 27, 2020, please contact the Advising Support Center (ASC) (<a href="mailto:oxadvising@emory.edu">oxadvising@emory.edu</a>).&#160;</p><p>Rising juniors/ graduating sophomores (Oxford Class of 2020): you have several advising options. Students who have declared a major in Emory College may receive separate communications from major departments. All Oxford students continuing to Emory College have a professional advisor in the Office for Undergraduate Education (Emory College&#8217;s equivalent to Oxford&#8217;s ASC); click here to <a href="http://college.emory.edu/oue/current-students/advising.html#find-your-oue-advisor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">find your advisor</a>.&#160;</p><p>Students continuing to the Goizueta Business School and School of Nursing, you will hear directly from the BBA and BSN programs about advising and registration procedures.</p><p>Oxford faculty advisors and the ASC are always available to give general advice to rising juniors/ graduating sophomores as well.&#160;</p><h2>7. Will I stay on track to graduate?</h2><p>Students will be provided equivalent opportunities to complete their current spring semester classes that they would have had during residential learning.&#160;</p><h2>8. What happens to the accommodations I have on file through the Department of Accessibility Services?</h2><p>While the structure of an online course may eliminate the need for many typical classroom accommodations, the environment may also create a unique set of needed accommodations. Communicate with your faculty as soon as possible to understand how the change of instruction may affect your accommodations. Visit&#160;<a href="https://emory-accommodate.symplicity.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Accommodate</a>&#160;for more information.</p><p>The Department of Accessibility Services will remain open Monday-Friday, 8am &#8211; 5pm, EST. All student appointments will be conducted via phone or virtually until further notice. DAS will not proctor exams while remote instruction is in place. If you have any questions or concerns, please email the&#160;Oxford office:&#160;<a href="mailto:oas_oxford@emory.edu">oas_oxford@emory.edu</a>.</p><h2>9.

The student, a resident at 12 Eagle Row, is in satisfactory condition and is self-isolating in off-campus housing provided by the university.&#160;</p><p>The student&#8217;s roommate also is self-isolating and both are being supported by Student Health Services and Campus Life staff.

In any public health crisis, it is imperative that information be shared with community members while protecting patient privacy.&#160;</p><p>According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, a large proportion of hospitalizations for COVID-19 in the U.S. includes people aged 20 to 54.&#160; For this reason, and as the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases increases in Georgia and across the country, it is imperative that students leave campus as soon as possible, in advance of the March 22 deadline for their departure.</p><p>Emory has offered to pack and ship or <span><a href="https://www.storagesquad.com/emory-student-storage/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">store</a></span> students&#8217;&#160; belongings, for those who cannot return to campus or want to leave immediately. For students who may not have the option to leave immediately, Emory is reviewing requests to allow students in especially difficult circumstances to remain on campus.&#160;</p><p>Students remaining on campus who develop symptoms, such as cough or fever, need to separate themselves from others and call Student Health Services at <a href="tel:404-727-7551">404-727-7551</a> (Atlanta campus), or Oxford College Student Services at <a href="tel:770-784-8376">770-784-8376</a>.</p><p>Emory&#8217;s commitment to the health and safety of our community is paramount.

Nevertheless, I apologize that we will not have our regular graduation celebrations, and wanted to let you know as soon as possible to help you with your plans.</p><p>Thankfully, cancellation will not be the last word. Together, we will recognize all that you have accomplished and celebrate your creativity, resilience, and resolve. I wish you great success as you move forward into the next phase of your lives. &#160;</p><p>I appreciate your patience and continued understanding as we navigate these challenges. Most of all, I encourage each member of the Emory community to continue to care for yourselves and your families during these very stressful times.

Students should expect that faculty will offer this combination.</span></li><li><span>Faculty are expected to continue offering regular instruction, assessment and feedback throughout the duration of the semester.</span></li><li><span>Faculty are expected to offer office hours through a virtual platform. You should confirm the times/availability of these directly with your faculty.</span></li><li><span>Experiential Courses (labs, research, performance courses, internships, etc.) are under review. While you will be unable to continue these courses on campus, your instructors/coordinators are working hard to translate these into a suitable remote format.

Since instruction will continue, no&#160;</span><span>instructional </span><span>costs will be reimbursed (tuition, technology fees, etc.) Other services that will remain available to students, such as health related fees, will also not be refunded.&#160;</span></p><h2><span>Federal Work Study Income Replacement</span><span></span></h2><p><span>The Department of Education has authorized the payment of unutilized Federal Work Study funds to each impacted student.

With that in mind</span><span>, Emory will provide an immediate &#8220;Student Support Stipend&#8221; to eligible undergraduate students in the amount of $1,000 within the next week. Students will be contacted by the Office of Financial Aid.</span></p><h2><span>Student Employee Salary Replacement</span><span></span></h2><p><span>Emory students of various income levels and backgrounds hold jobs at Emory and are classified as student employees. These jobs may be administrative, research focused, athletic support or various other activities. The rate of pay is different for each student employee and the hours may vary by job as well as by week-to-week availability, depending upon the student&#8217;s academic load and the unit&#8217;s need. We are concerned about the impact of COVID-19 on the financial well-being of these students who depend on this income in their financial planning.</span></p><p><span>As a means of supporting our student employees as the university moves to remote work and students are leaving campus, we propose to pay estimated earnings for the remaining weeks of the term based on their historical time worked.&#160; Students may check with their hiring unit to see if it is possible to continue to work remotely and may be paid for that time as well.</span></p><h2>Emory Employees Pay and Compensation<span></span></h2><p><span>We are making the commitment that regular faculty and staff employed by Emory University will be paid as usual for the current anticipated duration of the social distancing protocols, no matter their role within Emory and the altered learning/working environment.

Those interviews not only determine a patient&#8217;s contacts and activities, they help guide the university in taking action to safeguard the community&#8217;s health.</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s2">Emory will update the public on COVID-19-specific updates and information via the Emory COVID-19 <a href="http://www.emory.edu/coronavirus/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span class="s3">website</span></a></span><span class="s1">, &#8220;Coronavirus Updates for the Emory Community.&#8221;</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s2">When the spread of COVID-19 was first reported in the U.S., Emory increased the frequency and intensity of its cleaning regime in all areas of the university, focusing on commons areas such as bathrooms, dining facilities and meeting rooms. If students or other members of the university community are tested for COVID-19 &#8211;&#8211; as with our two undergraduate students who were tested on March 14 &#8212; their rooms and workspaces will be cleaned and disinfected as detailed above. </span></p><p class="p3"><span class="s2">We have been advising students to leave campus and, if possible, return to their homes. We understand that it is not possible for all, so Emory is prepared to provide support to those who are unable to relocate and have been granted an exemption. All other students must move out of the residence halls by March 22 at 5 p.m. If you are concerned about traveling to campus to help your student move out, please know that the university </span><span class="s4"><strong>can pack and ship belongings or store them locally for your student.</strong></span><span class="s2"> We can also make arrangements for you and your student to move out during non-peak hours.</span></p><p class="p3"><span class="s2">For those students who cannot leave campus, Student Health Services will remain open. At this time, our care model will be a hybrid of virtual assessment and in-person visits. In order to manage the volume and protect the health of our patients and caregivers, Student Health Services will identify via phone the best course to seek treatment for those who feel unwell. Students with urgent concerns should call </span><span class="s5">Student Health Services at 404-727-7551 or Oxford Student Health Services at 770-784-8376</span><span class="s2">. In the event of severe symptoms, including shortness of breath, fever, dizziness, or chest pain, they should call 911 directly. </span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Emory&#8217;s commitment to the health and safety of our community is paramount. A team of representatives from emergency preparedness, health care, campus life and other units are working to protect students, faculty, staff and visitors.

The students are being supported and closely monitored by Emory's student health services staff.&#160;&#160;</p><p>More information is being gathered about their recent activity and will be shared with those who have been in direct contact with these students. &#160;Whenever pertinent information becomes available, we will share it with the Emory community.&#160;</p><p>As the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases increases in Georgia and across the country, students should self-assess for fever or cough. Students who develop symptoms need to separate themselves from others and call Student Health Services at 404-727-7551 (Clifton Rd. campus), or Oxford College Student Services at 770-784-8376. Off campus students should contact their primary care physician if they feel sick or call 911 if their symptoms warrant emergency care.</p><p>As the trajectory of cases is likely to increase, Emory will continue to report on COVID-19 testing among students, faculty and staff and will report outcomes to the community and the public via the <span><a href="https://www.emory.edu/coronavirus/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Emory COVID-19 website</a></span>. Additional resources and key updates can also be found on the webpage.</p><p>I am keenly aware of the anxiety, uncertainty, and concern that so many of us are experiencing during this global public health crisis. Profound disruptions to our daily lives are multiplying. In the midst of these major stressors, I encourage you to keep in mind that Emory&#8217;s commitment to the health and safety of our community is paramount. A team of representatives from emergency preparedness, health care, campus life and other units are working to protect students, faculty, staff and visitors. We also continue to partner closely with local, state, and federal agencies.</p><p>I want to thank the many members of our community who are rising to the occasion and caring for those in our community and beyond. I especially want to thank our courageous Emory healthcare workers who are on the front lines of this fight. While this is not how we hoped the spring semester would unfold, together we will see our way through this crisis. And together, we will emerge stronger as a community.</p><p>With gratitude,</p><p>Claire E.

Even though our community may not be together physically for an unforeseen time, we are committed to moving forward together, united in spirit and service and preserving the care and compassion that have long been a hallmark of this university.&#160;</p><p>That is foundational to who we are as a community, and it will not change.&#160;</p><p>Over the past 24 hours, we&#8217;ve understandably received many questions &#8212; concerns about housing, remote learning and working, and especially how to best help the Emory community, particularly our students. Many <a href="https://www.emory.edu/coronavirus/faq/index.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">answers</a> to those questions will be updated daily at <a href="https://www.emory.edu/coronavirus/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Coronavirus Updates for the Emory Community</a>, a website dedicated to our response to COVID-19.</p><p>It is heartening to be joined by the broader Emory community in our commitment to serving our students. In fact, it&#8217;s been moving to see just how quickly support can coalesce.&#160;</p><p>Even as students began packing to leave campus, the Emory Student Government Association&#160; was distributing <a href="https://www.facebook.com/EmoryUniversitySGA/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">free MARTA passes</a> to help with transportation. We&#8217;ve seen staff members working long hours to assist students with specific needs, faculty rapidly developing online lesson plans, and caring alumni who&#8217;ve stepped forward to volunteer their help.&#160;</p><p>That outpouring of support has been heartwarming and, of course, not unexpected. For those who are able and eager to help, please consider contributing to the&#160;<a href="https://momentum.emory.edu/project/15970" rel="noopener" target="_blank">student hardship fund</a><u>.</u>&#160;In addition, the&#160;<a href="https://momentum.emory.edu/project/20378" rel="noopener" target="_blank">faculty and staff hardship fund</a>&#160;offers assistance to other members of our campus community who might be impacted by COVID-19.</p><p>Moving forward, perhaps one of the most important things we can all do is stay strong and healthy for each other &#8212; for our communities, our families and our friends. Let&#8217;s work to preserve those connections, our fundamental human bonds.&#160;</p><p>Amid these remarkable times, let us prove what a community can be.&#160;</p><p>Together, we will be stronger for it.&#160;</p><br/><p>In community,&#160;</p><p>Jan Love, Interim Provost and Executive Vice President for Academic Affairs&#160;</p><p>Christopher L.

We are reaching out to follow-up on our previous email amid the changing international landscape.</p><p>As these changes highlight, international travel is growing increasingly inaccessible.&#160;<strong>Emory University is discontinuing all on-site study abroad programs. At this time, we are directing&#160;<strong>all&#160;study abroad students to return home and&#160;continue their studies remotely.</strong></strong></p><p>We remain committed to working with you directly to determine the best method to maintain academic continuity. In most cases, this will mean completing online coursework provided by your current program or university abroad. If an online option is not available, we will work with you to make a contingency plan. These changes will obviously disrupt your semester plans. We ask that you be patient as we work with you to find an individualized solution for the remainder of your semester. &#160;</p><p>Every student will have unique circumstances to consider when making plans to return home. Students who are not U.S. citizens, have underlying medical conditions, or have other extenuating circumstances should move quickly to make travel plans. If you are a non-U.S. citizen, you should arrange to travel immediately to a location that is suitable to remain for the semester. If you have an underlying medical condition, you should make plans to travel to the best location in which you will be able to maintain the level of care that you require. If you have these or any other&#160;extenuating circumstances, please reach out to your study abroad advisor for advice or resources specific to your needs.</p><p>Emory University is currently reviewing international travel policies, including study abroad, and you will receive more direction in the coming days. Our current understanding is that all students returning from countries with a CDC Level 3 Travel Health Notice for COVID-19 will be instructed by public health authorities to quarantine for 14 days upon return to the United States and practice social distancing.</p><p>The circumstances that have resulted from this global health crisis are frequently changing, and we know that this can cause uncertainty, particularly when you are traveling abroad. We hope that this advice will help you to make more informed decisions about your next steps.&#160;</p><p>Do not hesitate to reach out to your study abroad advisor with any concerns so that we can connect you with resources and support as you transition home.</p><p>Sincerely,</p><p><a href="http://studyabroad.emory.edu/contact/advising/semesteryear.html">Emory College Study Abroad</a> | <a href="mailto:jeremy.billetdeaux@emory.edu">Goizueta BBA Study Abroad</a></p><div class="clearfix"></div></div></div></td></tr><tr id="message-students-international-03-12-20"><td class="small">

The decision has been made by the university to extend spring break until March 22 for students. Classes will resume in a remote learning environment on March 23 through the end of the semester. The university currently recommends cancelling all gatherings not essential to the academic mission of the school, and will send additional guidance in this area soon.</span></p><p><span>The university is making decisions based on the latest available information from the CDC and public health experts. As a school, it is important that we align with and complement university-level guidelines. We know that sudden shifts in operations can be challenging. Please know that we are here to assist and support you throughout this transition. We learned a lot about how to most effectively target faculty and staff for relevant technology training based on the survey that many of you completed earlier this week, so thank you for taking the time to provide this valuable information.</span></p><p><span>Our goal for the next 10 days is to prepare our faculty and students for the immediate shift to remote course delivery effective March 23. The Rollins COVID-19 Preparation and Response team has drafted guidance for faculty, staff, and students to support this transition and to ensure the smooth continuation of all operations. Included in this guidance are detailed instructions on how to access the necessary support to transition coursework to Internet-based platforms (this includes online support, webinars, and in-person technical support).We will share this guidance document with all of you later today. Please note that this is a working document that will be adjusted daily as the situation rapidly evolves. Please also regularly visit the Rollins website for up-to-date COVID-19-related information as it pertains to Rollins, including the latest version of the guidance document.</span></p><p><span>At this point in time, faculty and staff should continue to report to work as normal. We ask that staff work closely with their supervisors to make teleworking arrangements as needed and that faculty and supervisors be flexible in making these arrangements, particularly for those staff who are at higher risk for disease transmission. It is important for all faculty and staff to make preparations to transition to teleworking (to the extent possible) in the event that university guidance changes.

To that end, we request that you continue to treat others with respect and generosity.

We will provide you with regular updates regarding the outcomes of these meetings and how day-to-day operations at Rollins may be affected as COVID-19 develops. A Rollins web page dedicated to these updates is forthcoming. At the current moment, all classes and programming at Rollins are operating normally. &#160;</p><p>We are fortunate to have substantial expertise here at Rollins to support this preparation and response effort.

Because new events continue to unfold, there is no one complete set of answers to the questions you may have, but we can point you to information I believe you will find helpful.&#160; &#160;</p><p>No doubt one of the things that attracted you to Oxford College was our close-knit community.&#160; You have the support of your student cohort, and you also have the support of Oxford&#8217;s faculty and staff.&#160; We are here to support you in whatever way you need. &#160;</p><p>Please also know that leaders at every level of the University are monitoring events in a calm and dynamic way, planning for possibilities that could arise from a variety of issues and thinking about the questions that all members of our community will have.</p><p>Emory has many resources that position us well to respond to this situation.&#160; Besides strong university leadership, we have CEPAR, the Emory team committed to critical-event preparedness and response.&#160; Our tool kit includes strength in public health through the professionals at Rollins School of Public Health, Emory Healthcare&#8217;s proven track-record in responding to infectious diseases, and the University&#8217;s close working relationship with the CDC.</p><p>For ongoing information and updates about COVID-19 itself and specifics about the response at Emory, please consult<span>&#160;</span><a href="https://news.emory.edu/stories/2020/01/er_tn_coronavirus/campus.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">this Emory News coronavirus update page</a>.&#160; The page&#8217;s most recent update was yesterday, February 27, and the information contained there is being updated regularly.</p><p>The Emory News page as well as<span>&#160;</span><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">this CDC page</a><span>&#160;</span>have information on how to prevent transmission of the disease, and to avoid other maladies such as the common cold and the flu.&#160; As you know, there are currently no known cases of COVID-19 in Georgia, though there are plenty of other ailments whose spread could be mitigated through the same healthy practices.&#160; Should there be cases on this campus or anywhere at Emory, we have contingency plans in place and we will continue to develop them.&#160;</p><p>Many of you are concerned about how COVID-19 will affect your plans for the summer.&#160; We are also aware that new and returning students may have issues returning to the United States and to campus in August.&#160; You should know that we are speaking with, and will continue to work with, Atlanta colleagues to seek housing solutions for students who wish to stay for part or all of the summer in this area.&#160; Some students may wish to enroll in summer school on the Atlanta campus.&#160; We are looking into other activities and options that we might offer.</p><p>Some of you are involved in spring break or May travel courses.

It is our sincerest hope that you and your loved ones are safe and healthy.</p><p>Please continue to check this page for the most up-to-date information related to prospective and enrolling students.</p><h3>Emory's Holistic Review Process</h3><p>Emory University will continue to review all applications, including those from regions impacted by coronavirus, in a holistic and equitable fashion for both Emory College and Oxford College. Emory's commitment to the application review process includes looking at each student's academic preparation in the context of their high school along with personal attributes.<br/><br/>Rest assured that all Regular Decision applications will receive the same equitable review and attention as students who applied in Early Decision I and Early Decision II. The health emergency related to coronavirus is not influencing the review process.</p><h3>Submitting Materials</h3><p>We understand that some students attend schools that are temporarily closed. These closures may prevent you from submitting needed materials for your Regular Decision application. We will continue to receive and process all materials sent to us for as long as possible in the coming weeks.<br/><br/><strong>Please know that your application will be reviewed without your mid-year transcripts and reports.</strong>&#160;If you are able to submit those materials, we kindly request that you do so. But if your school is closed right now, your application will be reviewed without them.<br/><br/>As a reminder, all application materials, apart from mid-year transcripts, were due to our office at the Regular Decision deadline of January 1, which was then extended to January 10. Our hope is that applicants were able to submit everything in a timely fashion already.<br/><br/>But if you still need to submit items, we will continue to add them to your application file. You may upload many items yourself through your&#160;<a href="http://apply.emory.edu/status">Emory applicant portal.</a></p><h3>Modified IB/AP Testing and Graduation</h3><p>For students admitted in Early Decision I or Early Decision II, we understand that some of you may attend schools that are temporarily closed, preventing you from completing what is considered a "typical last semester" of classes, testing protocols, or graduation.<br/><br/>We will continue to work with you and your school in the coming weeks and months to navigate this process. At this time, we do not anticipate any school situations that would prevent you from enrolling at Emory University.</p><h3>Can I still get a Visa for the U.S.?</h3><p>For all enrolling students, Emory University is closely monitoring the virus and its spread. University administration follows all recommendations provided by the U.S. Department of State and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).&#160;While the university has paused all travel to China&#160;and South Korea at this time, our hope is that the travel recommendations will change in the coming months.</p><p>Typically our offices begin working on visa paperwork in April and May, and that work carries on with enrolling students through June, July, and August. We are hopeful for a smooth I-20 and visa process this year for all incoming international students, including those from impacted regions.&#160;<br/><br/>Any updates to this timeline will be shared here as well as with international students via email.&#160;<em>If you have further questions, contact us at&#160;<a href="mailto:admission@emory.edu?subject=enrolling%20student%20from%20China">admission@emory.edu</a>.

At this time, according to the CDC,<span>&#160;</span><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-in-us.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">there are no cases in Georgia and only five confirmed cases in the United States</a>.</p><p>Due to the contagious nature of the virus, which can cause pneumonia, CDC recommends that travelers avoid all nonessential travel to China at this time. CDC and public health agencies are closely monitoring the disease. On Emory campus, a team of leaders from emergency preparedness, health care, campus life, and other units has been monitoring the outbreak closely to protect students, faculty, staff, and visitors. Emory officials also continue to work closely with local and state partners.</p><ul class="list-unordered"><li><a href="https://news.emory.edu/stories/2020/01/er_tn_coronavirus/campus.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">View Emory&#8217;s coronavirus resource page.</a></li><li><a href="http://campuslife.emory.edu/notifications/coronavirus.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Read Campus Life&#8217;s message to students</a>.</li></ul><p>If you are in a situation where essential travel to Wuhan or other areas of China are required, please refer to the<span>&#160;</span><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/index.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">guidelines listed on the CDC&#8217;s website</a>.</p><p>As public health practitioners, we know that knowledge and preparedness are our greatest tools when faced with outbreaks of this nature.
