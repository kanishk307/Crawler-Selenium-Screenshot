                                                <div class="faq_answer"><p>In the absence of any Illinois stay-at-home order, the university intends to gradually reopen facilities and spaces on campus for research, scholarship and artistry. Toward that end, the Division of Research and Innovations Partnerships, in collaboration with the Return to Research and Graduate Studies Task Force, has created <a href="https://niuits.sharepoint.com/:b:/s/DivResearch/EcunZNU8f8JHtIQ3dbv1hKYBKNg6v3z5juBpIj4jOC6_cg">detailed guidance</a> for a phased approach that will require approval processes and specific safety measures. All scholarly activities that have been executed in a remote manner should continue remotely and are unaffected by this guidance. As always, our top priority remains the health, safety and well-being our faculty, staff, students and stakeholders.</p>

                                                <div class="faq_answer"><p>Fall offerings will include online, face-to-face and hybrid courses. Here&#8217;s what you can expect from each of these course-delivery methods.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Online courses</strong> &#8211; Fully online courses are being designed with careful planning to be flexible and to foster a sense of community, so that students are not learning on their own. In these courses, you might experience live conferencing and lectures; recorded content with no required meeting; or some combination of the two. In all cases, students and their professors will have an active presence in the virtual classroom.</li>
<li><strong>Face-to-face courses</strong> &#8211; These courses will be like what you&#8217;ve experienced in the past. Courses selected to be face-to-face&#8212;including laboratory classes and clinicals&#8212;require personal interactions, and the class sizes are small enough, or the academic spaces large enough, to maintain proper physical distancing.</li>
<li><strong>Hybrid courses</strong> &#8211; In hybrid courses, your learning experience will include both online and face-to-face interactions. For example, a science or engineering course might have online lessons with regular hands-on laboratory experiences.</li>
</ul>
<p>It&#8217;s important for you to connect with your advisor to understand your options or make any necessary schedule changes. Newly admitted students will receive more information about classes in advance of&#160;<a href="https://www.niu.edu/orientation">orientation,</a>&#160;where you will work with your advisor on selecting the best options for you.

                                                <div class="faq_answer"><p><strong>Synchronous online courses</strong> occur in real time and include activities such as live lectures or live conferencing. Synchronous courses are taught 100% online, but students will meet with the class at a set time each week via an online platform such as Blackboard Collaborate or Microsoft Teams. We&#8217;ve recently updated the MyNIU system, so when you register for a synchronous course in MyNIU, the system will indicate the course is online (100%) synchronous where the &#8220;room&#8221; is listed. You will also see course meeting times listed.</p>
<p><strong>Asynchronous online courses</strong> occur through online channels without real-time interaction and include activities such as recorded lectures and self-guided lessons. Asynchronous courses are taught 100% online, but do not have an assigned meeting time for the course. Instead, you can view lectures or work on lessons within a flexible time period, set by your instructor. We&#8217;ve recently updated the MyNIU system, so when you register for an asynchronous course in MyNIU, it will indicate the course is online (100%) asynchronous where the &#8220;room&#8221; is listed. There will not be listed course meeting times.</p>

                                                <div class="faq_answer"><p>In a small percentage of face-to-face (F2F) courses, classrooms cannot accommodate a full contingent of students at one time because of physical-distancing requirements. In those cases, students will either attend class or watch livestreamed events on a staggered and rotating schedule. For example, half of the students in a course might be in a physical classroom on Tuesdays, with the other half watching livestream; and vice versa on Thursdays. Faculty members will determine the staggered-attendance schedules for those classes and will communicate to the students prior to the start of classes.</p>

The educational experience is different, but the quality and value remain high.</p>
<p>Tuition covers the cost of credit-bearing courses whether they are taken face-to-face or online. For example, tuition for these courses cover faculty salaries, technology resources, and academic support services. At some universities, online courses cost more than face-to-face courses. However, because our commitment to affordability, the NIU undergraduate tuition rate is the same for on-campus and on-line courses.</p>

Your F-1 and J-1 student status remains valid. According to USCIS, temporary, non-face-to-face instruction is allowed in emergency situations.

<li>At this time, we do not know what the impact will be on your status or your progress towards eligibility for F-1 benefits like Curricular Practical Training (CPT) or Optional Practical Training (OPT). Accommodations were made for spring 2020; updates and guidance have not been issued for fall 2020.</li>
<li>Modified instruction does not necessarily mean on-demand or self-paced online content. Faculty might conduct virtual lectures at the normal time you would meet for class, which could create challenges for your attendance with time zone differences.</li>
<li>Maintaining normal academic progress is your responsibility and required to maintain your visa status.</li>
<li>You must check the validity of your F-1 and J-1 visas. Many U.S. consulates have closed their doors for the foreseeable future, which could create complications if you will need a new visa to return for the fall semester.</li>
<li>If this is your final semester and you have applied or intend to apply for Optional Practical Training (OPT), United States Citizenship and Immigration Services still currently requires you to be inside the U.S. to apply for and receive the OPT benefit. If you want OPT, you should not leave.</li>
<li>Make sure to get a travel signature before you depart. International Student and Scholar Services staff are prepared to sign your I-20s right away on a drop-in basis.</li>
