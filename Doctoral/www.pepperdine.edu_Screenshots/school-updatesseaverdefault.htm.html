                     <p>Please contact your professor(s) via email. Contact information for each professor

                     <p>Classes will maintain the same student learning outcomes as when you began the semester.
                        Professors have adjusted course activities to ensure that those learning outcomes
                        are achieved through distance learning. Your professors may choose to use synchronous
                        and asynchronous instruction. Synchronous instruction means that the class is meeting
                        together at the same time, through Zoom or some other online tool. All synchronous
                        online sessions at Seaver College will be scheduled during the normal class time (Pacific
                        Standard Time). Asynchronous instruction means that the professor will assign something
                        for you to watch, read, write, discuss, enact, record, etc., at your own pace (with
                        a deadline) but not during the exact timeframe of your normally scheduled class. Most
                        classes will probably be a blend of synchronous and asynchronous instruction.<br><br></p>
                     
                     <h4>Do I have to attend a synchronous class session?</h4>
                     
                     <p>Yes, unless your professor indicates differently, or you have an extenuating circumstance
                        that makes it impossible. In that case, handle communication with your professor in
                        the same way you would an absence in an in-person class (or in whatever way you have
                        been instructed by your professor). Please keep in mind that the college is following
                        the normal class schedule, and your scheduling priority should be to attend classes,
                        just as it would be if we were all together on campus.<br><br></p>
                     
                     <h4>What if I am in a different time zone and a synchronous class or exam is happening
                        at an unreasonable time?
                     </h4>
                     
                     <p>We have asked professors to ensure that students attend class and take exams during
                        reasonable waking hours. If you are in a different time zone, please let your professors
                        know your situation so that they can offer alternatives. Synchronous sessions will
                        be recorded, and synchronous exams can be rescheduled. The best approach is to work
                        directly with your professors, but if you need additional assistance with anything
                        academic, please contact the divisional dean who oversees that specific course.<br><br></p>

                     <h4>Will the content covered in final exams still be the same?</h4>
                     
                     <p>The content of finals and other assignments will be determined by each professor.
                        The intent is to cover the learning objectives of the course, but professors may choose
                        to adjust the content of assignments or exams. If they do so, they will notify you
                        by an adjustment to the syllabus.<br><br></p>

                     <h4>What about assigned group projects? How should we meet with our group?</h4>
                     
                     <p>If group projects are part of your course, your professor will advise you on how these
                        will be handled. In some cases, group projects will continue online, with students
                        meeting through Zoom or other methods. In other cases, the professor may choose to
                        substitute a different assignment. Professors will be considering time zone differences
                        as they make these decisions. If you wish to organize study groups for a course, a
                        convenient way to do so is to use the Navigate app's Study Buddies feature. Students
                        can also use Zoom to initiate group meetings or study sessions.<br><br></p>

                     <p>Each of these types of courses poses different challenges. Faculty are working to
                        develop plans, and you should already have received communication from your professor(s)
                        about how each course will be handled.

                     <p>Faculty have created experiences that students can do remotely to fulfill the learning
                        outcomes of the course. These activities will vary by class but might include structured
                        assignments of physical activity with logged hours and ways for students to report
                        their activities. Zoom meetings are a possibility for overseeing some of these activities
                        as well as assessments and feedback. If you have a specific question, please contact
                        your professor.<br><br></p>

                     <p>Convocation credit is now complete for all students enrolled in the spring 2020 semester,
                        resulting in a grade of "A." Some club convos may choose to continue to meet remotely.

                        The process and schedule for your thesis will stay the same. Your defense may be in

                        through the end of the term. If you can continue your internship through the end of
                        the term either in person or remotely, you may continue your internship if you wish.
                        Connect with your faculty, submit the log described above, and complete the assignments
                        in your syllabus. Please note: an internship is not a guarantee of on-campus housing.
                        Please review HRL communications for the housing policies.

                     <p>Students may convert up to eight (8) units of current coursework, during the Spring
                        2020 term to Cr/NC. Senior seminars and capstone courses are excluded along with a
                        select number of courses that are required for credentialing. The following is a list
                        of excluded courses:

                     </p>
                     
                     <p>Students are reminded that Cr is awarded for work equivalent to at least a C letter
                        grade. Work equivalent to C- or lower will earn the grade of NC.
                     </p>
                     
                     <p>A Cr/NC carries no grade points and is not computed into a student's semester or cumulative
                        grade point average (GPA.)
                     </p>
                     
                     <p>A grade of NC means that a student will need to retake the course if it is needed
                        for graduation. A grade of NC may also be considered evidence of poor academic work
                        in cases of academic probation or academic dismissal.<br><br></p>
                     
                     <p><strong>Advising</strong></p>
                     
                     <p>Before changing the grading status of any course, it is highly recommended that students
                        consult with their major advisor. Students planning on enrolling in graduate school,
                        professional schools, e.g. medical school, or who plan to complete certification or
                        credentialing exams after graduation must ensure that courses graded on a Cr/NC basis
                        will fulfill entrance or other program requirements.<br><br></p>
                     
                     <p><strong>Prerequisites</strong></p>
                     
                     <p>At Seaver College broadly, the prerequisite for sequential courses is a C. Under this
                        temporary policy, a Cr will satisfy the prerequisite for advancing to the next course.
                        An exception is BA 321, which will still require a letter grade.<br><br></p>
                     
                     <p><strong>Repeating a course</strong></p>
                     
                     <p>If you select the Cr/NC option for a course you are repeating, as part of this exception,
                        a grade of Cr will meet a prerequisite and allow you to continue to the next-level
                        course. Conversely, a grade of NC will mean that you need to take the course again
                        if it is a requirement.<br><br></p>
                     
                     <p><strong>Courses taken at other schools (e.g. School of Law)</strong></p>
                     
                     <p>The Cr/NC policy applies only to courses taken at Seaver. Courses taken at other schools,
                        such as those for certificate programs, are subject to the policies of those schools.<br><br></p>
                     
                     <p><strong>Are students on academic probation eligible to take their courses Cr/NC?</strong></p>
                     
                     <p>Students on academic probation may elect to take their courses Cr/NC; however, if
                        there is a question of academic probation or academic dismissal, each NC will be considered
                        evidence of poor academic work.<br><br></p>
                     
                     <p><strong>Can student-athletes change courses to Cr/NC?</strong></p>
                     
                     <p>Student-athletes who wish to change courses to Cr/NC should please check with <a href="mailto:jordan.holm@pepperdine.edu">Jordan Holm</a> before submitting the request, as we want to ensure that they maintain NCAA eligibility.<br><br></p>
                     
                     <p><strong>When is the deadline to switch to Cr/NC?</strong></p>
                     
                     <p>Students previously studying on the <strong>Malibu campus</strong> must complete the form by <strong>April 10, 2020</strong>. Students previously studying in <strong>International Programs</strong> must complete the form by<strong> April 6, 2020</strong>.

                     <p>No. Your visa (in your passport) will not be canceled by the US government unless
                        there has been a violation of status. The current COVID-19 outbreak does not affect
                        the validity of your visa- whether or not you are in the US or return to your home
                        country.<br><br></p>

                     <p>No, you may remain in the US for the duration of your F-1 status (while you are attending
                        school or engaging in OPT) even after your visa has expired. If you leave the US,
                        however, you cannot re-enter on an expired visa. Some exceptions may apply if you
                        are traveling to Canada, Mexico, or one of the islands adjacent to the US. For additional
                        information on exceptions, contact <a href="/international-students/">OISS.</a><br><br></p>

                        passport, please contact the consulate of the country that issued your passport at
                        least one year before it expires.

                        even if they have left the US and are taking online classes elsewhere. This temporary

                        we recommend that you contact OISS and consult with your DSO after you have prepared
                        your application materials to ensure you have not missed anything.

                        known as Zoombombing, where unwanted participants enter the Zoom meeting room and
                        screen-share and/or proceed to say or write very offensive things. Zoombombing can
                        usually be prevented by following these best practices:

                           (^) next to Share | Advanced Sharing Options | Only Host.
                        </li>
                        
                        <li>Mute participants upon entry and disable their ability to unmute themselves. In Zoom,
                           click Manage Participants | the "More" button and check both "Mute Participants On
                           Entry" and "Allow participants to unmute themselves."
                        </li>
                        
                        <li>Allow participants to chat with the host only. In Zoom, click Chat | the "ellipsis"
                           button and check "Host only."<br><br></li>

                     <p>Yes. Seaver College will offer every course planned for Sessions I, II, and III in
                        Malibu during summer 2020. The college has deferred the start of Session I (May) by
                        four weeks and merged all classes planned for Sessions II and III into a single combined
                        session. Seaver has added an online summer session, Session A, during the previously
                        planned Session I period. With these changes, the revised Seaver College academic
                        calendar for summer 2020 is as follows:

                     <p>We remain hopeful that safer-at-home restrictions will relax and allow for a return
                        to campus for the combined summer Session II/III that begins on July 6. As our plans
                        evolve, we pledge to remain in close communication and quickly share decisions as
                        they are made. The college will announce a decision on the delivery format for all
                        Session II/III classes no later than June 8.<br><br></p>

                     <p>Seaver College has suspended all summer international programs for 2020. This decision
                        was made based on all information available to the University, including the spread
                        of COVID-19, travel warnings from national and international organizations, commercial
                        flight availability, academic programming needs, feedback from program directors and
                        other personnel responsible for leading these programs, and our care for the student

                     <p>To support students enrolled in summer IP programs, the college will offer all courses
                        planned for each summer international program on the Malibu campus during the summer
                        of 2020 to the greatest extent possible.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br></p>
                     
                     <h4>What financial support is available for summer school in 2020?</h4>
                     
                     <p>To support student enrollment during Session A and Session I, Seaver College will
                        provide all students who complete an online course or courses a credit of either $805
                        (an amount equal to the cost of a double occupancy room and 600 point meal plan) or
                        an amount equal to the cost of tuition less other forms of applicable financial aid.
                        In all cases, the sum of both financial aid and credit will not exceed the total cost
                        of tuition.&nbsp;Additionally, qualified students remain eligible to receive other forms
                        of financial aid during the summer term.
                     </p>
                     
                     <p>There have been no changes to the financial assistance planned for Session II/III.
                        If classes during this Session are delivered in-person on the Malibu campus as desired,
                        enrolled students living on-campus will receive free housing in a double occupancy
                        room and a 600 point on-campus meal plan. Students living off-campus will receive
                        a 600 point on-campus meal plan. Please be aware that all meal plan points will expire
                        at the end of Session II/III; they will not roll forward to the fall semester. Should
                        it be necessary to transition Session II/III courses to remote instruction, a credit
                        identical to the one explained previously for Session I will replace the planned room
                        and meal plan assistance.&nbsp;

                     <p><strong>What will registration and withdrawals be like?</strong></p>
                     
                     <p>Registration for all summer Session I and Session II/III classes remains open and
                        all late registration and term withdrawal fees for the summer sessions have been waived.
                        (These fees are listed in Seaver College catalogue, pg. 31.) Students are encouraged
                        to reach out to either their faculty or OneStop advisor using the Navigate platform
                        (or via email) to schedule an advising appointment to support their enrollment in

                     <p><strong>I need an internship in order to complete my degree requirements, how can I find one?</strong></p>
                     
                     <p>The good news is that there are some industries that are still hiring interns. The
                        Career Center has several resources to assist you with your search. Visit <a href="https://seaver.pepperdine.edu/career-services/covid-19-services/">Career Services During COVID-19</a> for virtual resources. You can also make an appointment with an industry specialist
                        for individual guidance. To schedule an appointment with an industry specialist log
                        onto <a href="https://pepperdine.joinhandshake.com/">Handshake,</a> click on "Career Center" tab, select" Appointments" and "Schedule a New Appointment."
                        For open sessions with career counselors, select "<a href="https://learn.joinhandshake.com/students/ask-me-anything-attend-open-sessions-with-career-counselors/">Ask Me Anything</a>" via Handshake.&nbsp;<br><br><strong>Since many in-person internships have been cancelled, will the college allow remote
                           internships?</strong><br><br>Yes, remote internships will be eligible for academic credit this summer. These internships
                        will go through the same process as an in-person internship. The faculty member and
                        divisional dean will vet the internship to make sure it meets the standards necessary
                        to be eligible for academic credit.<br><br><strong>What if I can't find an internship, will I still be able to graduate?</strong><br><br>The college is committed to doing everything within our power to facilitate your timely
                        degree completion. If you have not been able to find an internship, contact your faculty
                        advisor. He or she can work with you on options to fulfill the requirement. These
                        options may include a course substitution, enrolling in and completing an independent
                        study, or enrolling in internship units and completing alternative activities to meet
                        the learning outcomes. <strong>If you have not secured an internship by June 15, contact your faculty advisor or
                           divisional dean.</strong><br><br><strong>What are some internship search resources?</strong></p>
                     
                     <p>Visit <a href="https://seaver.pepperdine.edu/career-services/covid-19-services/">Career Services During COVID-19</a> for remote internship opportunities.&nbsp;

                     <p><br><strong>Can I be enrolled before I find an internship?<br><br></strong>It is best that you find an internship first, and then complete the <a href="https://seaver.pepperdine.edu/career-services/students/internships/registration/">internship form</a>.&nbsp;Once all the signatures are secured, you will be enrolled.<strong><br><br>Can I be cleared for graduation if an internship is my only remaining requirement?<br><br></strong>"Cleared to graduate" means that a student is cleared to participate in the graduation
                        ceremony even though they have 12 or less units to complete. Since Seaver College
                        will not have an in-person graduation ceremony in May, it is not necessary to be cleared
                        before the end of the spring term. Please note that you still need to complete the
                        <a href="https://seaver.pepperdine.edu/graduation/content/seaverug.pdf">intent to graduate form</a>. This gives the registrar's office permission to post your degree once you have completed
                        all requirements.<strong><br></strong></p>
