                        Are there alternative internships I could pursue?
                     </h4>
                     
                     <p>Internships are an integral part of the experiential learning process and often lead
                        students into career opportunities upon graduation. Students will still be expected
                        to fulfill their 240-hour internship requirements and should be actively seeking internship
                        opportunities if not already secured. We are regularly checking with our professional
                        networks and job boards to seek out internship opportunities.
                     </p>
                     
                     <p>The School of Public Policy has approved a "Flexible Internship Strategy" that has
                        additional options beyond those we reported to you in March. Students who are still
                        looking for internships, finding it difficult to secure traditional and or remote
                        internship opportunities, or concerned about meeting the 240-hour requirement may
                        now consider the options below. Each request to pursue "flexible" options will be
                        considered on a case-by-case basis and will need to be approved by Kirsten Vassie
                        PRIOR to pursuit. Students' demonstration of significant progress in securing an internship
                        (meetings with Kirsten, updated resume, cover letters, number of organizations where
                        applications submitted are examples) will be considered in the approval process.
                     </p>
                     
                     <ul>
                        
                        <li>Remote work will continue to be an option for approved organizations.</li>
                        
                        <li>Students, who cannot complete the full 240-hour requirement with a single organization,
                           may request to have a "second" internship approved to supplement the hours for the
                           full credit. "Flexible" hours may be split between no more than two organizations.
                        </li>
                        
                        <li>Students, who can continue working with their current organization in future terms,
                           will be allowed to carry-over their enrollment across consecutive semesters.
                        </li>
                        
                        <li>Research projects from current full-time SPP faculty will be considered. Faculty member(s)
                           would provide structure and oversight. Students are responsible for securing their
                           own research project, which must be approved.
                        </li>
                        
                        <li>Volunteering with an organization, ideally related to the student's area of specialization,
                           may be considered. This option would require a writing component as part of the assessment.
                        </li>
                        
                        <li>LinkedIn learning sessions may be a supplement to hours needed. A student would first
                           complete a soft-skills assessment with Kirsten and then complete recommended learning
                           modules to improve professional skills.

                        <li>Alumni informational interviews in an area that aligns with the student's career objectives
                           may supplement hours needed. Students would be required to work with Kirsten on outreach
                           and this option is subject to alumni availability. Students would prepare a written
                           assessment of the informational interview.
                        </li>
                        
                        <li>Employer informational interviews in an area that aligns with the student's career
                           objectives may supplement hours needed. The employer would need to be approved in
                           advance by Kirsten and a written assessment of the informational interview will be
                           required.
                        </li>
                        
                     </ul>
                     
                     <p>In all instances, students will be expected to assemble a portfolio of experiences
                        that is equivalent to the 240 hours required from the policy internship experience.
                        Students seeking credit for these alternative activities will need to receive prior
                        approval and to provide the documentation necessary for Kirsten to validate and approve
                        the hours.

                        Pepperdine is currently in a critical support personnel staffing model in which departments

                           classes where there is currently a notetaker. The note-takers will take notes in your
                           online class in the same way they take notes in your face-to-face class.

                           the appropriate extended time to that particular student. Some students have time
                           and a half extended time. This means for an hour exam, they would receive an hour
                           and one-half for the exam. Some students have double time extended time. If the rest
                           of the class receives an hour for the exam, this student would receive two hours.
                           If you are providing your exam on Sakai (Courses), you may work with your technology
                           liaison to create different exam links with different time parameters. If you are
                           planning on proctoring the exams, remember to allow students with extended time to
                           have their additional time without disruption.
