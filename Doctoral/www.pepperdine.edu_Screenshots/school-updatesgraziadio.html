                     <h4>How will Spring 2020 classes be impacted?</h4>
                     
                     <p>Effective Saturday, March 14, and through the remainder of the Spring 2020 term, campus-based
                        class sessions will shift to the online modality. The last day of in-person instruction
                        on campus is Friday, March 13. Meanwhile, classes in our already existing online programs
                        will continue to be delivered as planned.<br><br></p>
                     
                     <h4>Are my classes canceled for the remainder of the spring term?</h4>
                     
                     <p>No. Your classes will transition from meeting face to face to meeting virtually through
                        the remainder of the spring trimester. Students should expect the possibility of meeting
                        virtually using Zoom (referred to as synchronous learning), Courses (Sakai), and/or
                        other means to engage with course content at your own pace within a given timeframe
                        (referred to as asynchronous learning).
                     </p>
                     
                     <p>Your instructors are making every effort to ensure course continuity through the remainder
                        of the spring trimester. For any class meetings/activities that may be canceled, your
                        course instructors will be in contact with you with more details. Updates and announcements
                        will typically be sent to the entire class roster or posted on your course page (Sakai),
                        so please be sure to check for those frequently.<br><br></p>
                     
                     <h4>What should I be doing to prepare for the shift to online class sessions?</h4>
                     
                     <p>Be on the lookout for information and instructions from your professors regarding
                        the alternative arrangements that are being made to continue your courses. Due to
                        the need to rely on virtual instruction, you will need a computer equipped with a
                        microphone and camera (either built in or externally added) and as well as access
                        to a disruption-free environment during virtual class sessions. You should also familiarize
                        yourself with <a href="https://pepperdine.zoom.us/">Zoom</a>, our video conferencing platform, and <a href="https://courses.pepperdine.edu/">Sakai</a>, our University-adopted learning management system. Find resources that you may find
                        helpful in your preparations for online learning, including netiquette expectations,
                        academic and student policies, and links to tech support and tutorials for tools used
                        in each course, on the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/17RBzDiHzntOihqFq02qaIG4TCxuSaXrOymbB5_XR6lg/">Getting Started with Online Courses for Students Google Doc</a>.<br><br></p>
                     
                     <h4>How do I access Courses (Sakai)?</h4>
                     
                     <p>Think of Sakai as your virtual classroom space. You will access the course syllabus,
                        submit deliverables electronically, and complete quizzes/exams through the platform.
                        It is accessible via the <a href="https://courses.pepperdine.edu/">Courses website</a> or through <a href="http://wavenet.pepperdine.edu">Wavenet</a> through the "Courses" module.

                     <h4>How will assignments and tests be managed for my classes now that we are meeting online?</h4>
                     
                     <p>This will vary depending on the nature of the course and the types of assignments/exams
                        involved. Your professor will make the determination and inform the class accordingly.<br><br></p>
                     
                     <h4>Can students meet with faculty and/or staff face to face at one of our campuses?</h4>
                     
                     <p>In keeping with the practice of social distancing for the sake of our community health
                        and safety, students are not allowed to meet with faculty on any of our Pepperdine
                        campuses through the end of the spring term. Students are encouraged to meet with
                        faculty virtually.<br><br></p>
                     
                     <h4>Does this transition impact school processes, procedures, or policies?</h4>
                     
                     <p>No. All academic policies and timelines, the Code of Academic Ethics, and Student
                        Code of Conduct remain in effect.<br><br></p>

                        be conferred upon verification the requirements of your degree have been completed.

                        there has been a violation of status. The current situation due to the COVID-19 outbreak
                        does not affect the validity of your visa whether or not you are in the US or return
                        to your home country.<br><br></p>
                     
                     <h4>My F-1 visa will expire soon. Do I need to leave the US and obtain a new visa?</h4>
                     
                     <p>No. You may remain in the US for the duration of your F-1 status (in other words,
                        while you are attending school or engaging in OPT) even after your visa has expired.
                        If you leave the US, however, you cannot re-enter on an expired visa. You may be eligible
                        for an exception if you are traveling to Canada, Mexico, or one of the islands adjacent
                        to the US. Contact the OISS for more information.<br><br></p>

                     <p>You must maintain your passport's validity at all times. If you need to renew your
                        passport, please contact the consulate of the country that issued your passport at
                        least one year before it expires.<br><br></p>

                     <p>Students do not have to attend the commencement ceremony to graduate. If you applied
                        for graduation, contact the Registrar's Office for more information. In turn, the
                        Registrar's Office will be able to notify you in the event the commencement ceremony

                     <p>If you are graduating this Spring or Summer 2020, apply for OPT as soon as possible.
                        Go to the OPT Manual Spring 2020 version on the OISS website. The OPT Workshops have
                        been canceled for the rest of the Spring 2020 term. However, we recommend that you
                        contact the OISS and speak to your DSO after you have prepared your application materials,
                        to make sure you are not making any mistakes. If you do not plan to apply for OPT,
                        but need additional time before you feel safe to travel outside the US, you can file
                        an application for change of visa status to "visitor" status. Your application must
                        be filed before your F-1 status expires. Consulting an attorney is strongly recommended.<br><br></p>

                        for admission to the US to continue OPT. However, if you have been employed but were
                        working remotely from outside the US, your DSO should be consulted for the latest
                        guidance from the SEVP regarding students on OPT who are working remotely.<br><br></p>

Recognizing the challenges associated with students having to move out of on-campus
                        housing on short notice, the University Office of Housing and Residence Life (HRL)
                        has established a prioritization system for granting extensions. Among those who will
                        receive priority are international students who may have concerns regarding visa,
                        travel, and other safety concerns about traveling back to their home countries.<br><br></p>

                     <p>All students have a Zoom Pro account allowing you to host virtual study groups and
                        meetings with fellow classmates. You can access your account through the <a href="https://pepperdine.zoom.us/">Pepperdine Zoom web portal</a>. Additional information about the features and utilizing the tool is available on
                        the <a href="https://community.pepperdine.edu/it/tools/zoom/training.htm">IT Zoom webpage</a>.

                     <p>Treat the Zoom session as a private event and share the Zoom meeting link only with
                        the intended participants. Participants should not share the link publicly or with
                        others who do not need to be in the meeting. Participants are also advised to not
                        post the meeting link in social public forums. Faculty are encouraged to post the
                        meeting link in their institutional learning management system for students to access.<br><br></p>
                     
                     <h4>How can I prevent "Zoombombing" during a Zoom session?</h4>
                     
                     <p>Some universities and school districts are reporting inappropriate and offensive activities
                        known as Zoombombing, where unwanted participants enter the Zoom meeting room and
                        screen-share and/or proceed to say or write very offensive things. Zoombombing can
                        usually be prevented by following these best practices:
                     </p>
                     
                     <ul>
                        
                        <li>Assign screen sharing ability only to the host. In Zoom, click the upward arrowhead
                           (^) next to Share | Advanced Sharing Options | Only Host.
                        </li>
                        
                        <li>Mute participants upon entry and disable their ability to unmute themselves. In Zoom,
                           click Manage Participants | the "More" button and check both "Mute Participants On
                           Entry" and "Allow participants to unmute themselves."
                        </li>
                        
                        <li>Allow participants to chat with the host only. In Zoom, click Chat | the "ellipsis"
                           button and check "Host only."<br><br></li>
                        
                     </ul>
                     
                     <h4>What do I do if I experience offensive or disruptive activity during a Zoom session?</h4>
                     
                     <p>Zoombombing can happen in Zoom or any other video conferencing solution. If you experience
                        such activities, please report the incident as soon as possible to a member of the
                        <a href="https://community.pepperdine.edu/it/">University IT staff</a>.
