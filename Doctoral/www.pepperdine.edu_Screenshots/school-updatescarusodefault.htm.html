                        remote online programs will continue as normal without interruption.<br><br></p>

                     <p>No. The April MLS residency has been canceled. The MDR residency 2 has been moved
                        online and the spring DC study tour may be postponed until the fall. Further information

                     <p>Yes, the remaining Straus courses will all be online. Due to the interactive nature
                        of the Straus courses, please plan to have a reliable internet connection as the Straus
                        courses will be using video in addition to audio for online course sessions.<br><br></p>
                     
                     <h4>When will classes meet?</h4>
                     
                     <p>All classes meet at their regularly scheduled time via Zoom starting Monday, March
                        16. Please review <a href="https://lawtech.pepperdine.edu/zoom-for-students/">"Zoom: A Guide For Students,"</a> which provides instruction on how to download Zoom onto your computer and your cell
                        phone. Please download Zoom before your first class and become familiar with the program
                        so that you can troubleshoot any problems before live online classes.<br><br></p>
                     
                     <h4>What do I need to know about participating in classes via Zoom?</h4>
                     
                     <p>Review the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WySVwaZA0kGVBxwvFOB_AeB_rTOYyTsgyb6EZwU9-g0/edit?usp=sharing">Best Practices for Online Learning</a>.<br><br></p>
                     
                     <h4>Will class attendance be taken?</h4>
                     
                     <p>Yes. All classes will meet at their regularly scheduled time via a Zoom online meeting
                        which allows for participant interaction. There is no change to the attendance requirements
                        which are laid out in Section 5.11 of the <a href="https://community.pepperdine.edu/law/academics/academic-policies.htm">Academic Policy</a>. There is no change to the dates as set forth in the <a href="https://law.pepperdine.edu/degrees-programs/calendar/">Academic Calendar</a>. Per the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WySVwaZA0kGVBxwvFOB_AeB_rTOYyTsgyb6EZwU9-g0/edit">Best Practices for Online Learning</a>, to be counted present for class attendance purposes your video feed must be on and
                        you must be visible throughout class.<br><br></p>
                     
                     <h4>Will classes be recorded?</h4>
                     
                     <p>Individual professors will decide whether to record their classes. Even if classes
                        are recorded, in order to count as attending you must attend the class live and may
                        not just watch the recording later. Zoom is a synchronous learning platform, not a
                        videotaped lecture. If you would like to request a recording because you need to miss
                        the live class for some reason, just like with on-ground classes, please contact your
                        professors<span style="font-size: 1.6rem; color: #898989;">.<br><br></span></p>

                           more frequently than during the earlier part of the semester. To maximize the health
                           and safety of everyone in the Pepperdine community, your course professors and the
                           AMP professors have been instructed to set up virtual office hours using Zoom, phone,

                           the AMP and Bar Exam Workshop professors, you may set up phone and in-person meetings
                           with Professor Camacho and Dean Farrell using their individual meeting links: <a href="http://calendly.com/ann-camacho">Camacho</a> and <a href="http://calendly.com/selina-brandt">Farrell</a>.

                           subject to their field supervisors' instructions and policies. They should report
                           to their worksites as normal unless their workplaces institute policies that prevent
                           them from working on site.

                           remotely as instructed by their field placements. Externs should notify the Externship

                           they have the technological capacity and information necessary to work remotely should
                           that need arise.

                           without interruption to clients under faculty supervision, and clinic faculty and
                           supervising attorneys will adapt as necessary to ensure professional service to clients
                           and safety for students and the community. Individual clinics will have different
                           needs and responses to accommodate their respective practices, so clinical faculty
                           will be in close communication with students to ensure good practice and rich student
                           involvement.

                        <li>We are a law practice, so our duties remain to our clients. The beauty of clinical
                           practice is that every experience is a moment to learn, reflect, and prepare. To these
                           ends, we will necessarily have to adapt how we handle our practice, especially in
                           court. We likely will meet with clients remotely if possible, but if we cannot or
                           if that is not best for the client, we will proceed to fulfill our duties to clients
                           while taking all the best precautions for safety and health. Likewise, if we have
                           a litigation or mediation practice in court or elsewhere or have similar appearances
                           on our dockets, we plan to keep them and continue to engage and involve students fully
                           in practice. This is integral to professional education and the requirements of the
                           courses.

                     <p>The current disruptions do not affect the Fall London Program. Planning continues,
                        and we hope and expect that the Fall semester will begin and proceed without disruption.
                        Any decision to cancel the program is likely weeks away if it were to come, and the
                        global situation will likely have improved by then.

                     <p>If the University cancels the London Program because of the COVID-19 outbreak in the
                        future, the law school will refund deposits and will work earnestly to assist students
                        with alternative plans for classes and other programs.<br><br></p>

                           all appointments via Zoom. Counselors will continue to review documents and application
                           materials as normal.

                        the number of people at gatherings, the University is postponing all commencement
                        ceremonies scheduled for the spring. Nonetheless, graduating students who complete
                        their coursework will receive their degrees as scheduled. When campus reopens it will

                           or the speakers. Turn off Facebook and other social media apps. The only thing you

                        call in?

                     <p>You must use the Zoom app and connect via Internet. See our <a href="https://lawtech.pepperdine.edu/zoom-for-students/">guide for students here</a>. We strongly recommend that students use a computer with a reliable internet connection
                        for connecting to their Zoom class sessions. Telephone dial-in will not work for attending
                        classes remotely It is possible to connect using cell phone data to "tether" the phone's
                        internet connection to a laptop or desktop computer. Check with your mobile phone
                        provider for details on this feature.

                     <p>Treat the Zoom session as a private event and share the Zoom meeting link only with
                        the intended participants. Participants should not share the link publicly or with
                        others who do not need to be in the meeting. Participants are also advised to not
                        post the meeting link in social public forums. Faculty are encouraged to post the
                        meeting link in their institutional learning management system for students to access.<br><br></p>
                     
                     <h4>How can I prevent "Zoombombing" during a Zoom session?</h4>
                     
                     <p>Some universities and school districts are reporting inappropriate and offensive activities
                        known as Zoombombing, where unwanted participants enter the Zoom meeting room and
                        screen-share and/or proceed to say or write very offensive things. Zoombombing can
                        usually be prevented by following these best practices:
                     </p>
                     
                     <ul>
                        
                        <li>Assign screen sharing ability only to the host. In Zoom, click the upward arrowhead
                           (^) next to Share | Advanced Sharing Options | Only Host.
                        </li>
                        
                        <li>Mute participants upon entry and disable their ability to unmute themselves. In Zoom,
                           click Manage Participants | the "More" button and check both "Mute Participants On
                           Entry" and "Allow participants to unmute themselves."
                        </li>
                        
                        <li>Allow participants to chat with the host only. In Zoom, click Chat | the "ellipsis"
                           button and check "Host only."<br><br></li>
                        
                     </ul>
                     
                     <h4>What do I do if I experience offensive or disruptive activity during a Zoom session?</h4>
                     
                     <p>Zoombombing can happen in Zoom or any other video conferencing solution. If you experience
                        such activities, please report the incident as soon as possible to a member of the
                        <a href="https://community.pepperdine.edu/it/">University IT staff</a>.<br><br></p>
