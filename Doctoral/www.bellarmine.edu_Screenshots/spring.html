<p>From the President&rsquo;s iPhone, March 19, 2020</p>


</div>



<div >
    <div ><h2></h2><div class="accordion" id="pre"><a name="pre"></a>Letter from the President</div><div class="mypanel"><div class="clean"><h2>Dear members of the Bellarmine community,</h2><p>I am writing to you today to update you on some important decisions.&nbsp; These obviously are not decisions we wanted to make, but the national situation regarding COVID-19 has changed significantly in the last 24 to 36 hours.</p><p>As the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) situation rapidly evolves, we have made several very difficult decisions:</p><p><strong>Online courses, which began March 18, will continue for all of Spring 2020 and Summer 2020 semesters.&nbsp;</strong>For the most part, currently-listed summer courses will be delivered online. There are a few courses that cannot easily
            be translated to an online environment and have been cancelled. Students in those sections have already been notified.&nbsp;</p><p>To support the Center for Disease Control and Prevention&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/large-events/mass-gatherings-ready-for-covid-19.html">updated social distancing guidance</a>,&nbsp;<strong>residence halls will close to students on Saturday, March 21 at 3 p.m.</strong> Housing will only be available for students who are experiencing an undue hardship in completing their academic coursework and must live on campus due to personal safety and wellness concerns.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>All university events through May 15, including Senior Week activities, have been canceled or postponed.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Commencement, originally scheduled for May 9, has been postponed. <strong>The rescheduled commencement ceremony will be December 19, 2020</strong>, in Freedom Hall for students who complete degree requirements in Summer and Fall 2019; Spring and
            Summer 2020; and Fall 2020. Students who complete degree requirements at the end of this spring semester will still have an April 30, 2020 degree date posted on their transcripts. We will communicate with you about the availability of your
            diploma at a later date.</p><p>I know these precautions will be met with frustration and sadness, and believe me, everyone in the faculty and administration shares these feelings. We are sorry we will not be able to deliver the meaningful experiences that are normally part
            of the spring semester. It may be especially difficult to understand why we are taking what seem like radical steps when right now, the effects of COVID-19 aren&rsquo;t readily apparent in our city, and when people the age of our traditional
            student population don&rsquo;t seem to be severely affected.&nbsp;</p><p>But this virus is real. It is unlike anything any of us has experienced in our lifetimes. These changes are intended to protect the community and slow the rate at which the virus is spreading, while maintaining the integrity of our academic offerings.
        </p><p>One of our faculty experts, Dr. Karen Golemboski, has answered a number of questions related to COVID-19. You can read more from Dr. Golemboski <a href="https://www.bellarmine.edu/news/archives/2020/03/13/karen-golemboski-immunology-expert-coronavirus/">here</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>We will continue to update this page with the latest information for you, including up-to-date info on how to access campus services. You may also email&nbsp;<a href="mailto:questions@bellarmine.edu">questions@bellarmine.edu</a>&nbsp;if you&rsquo;re
            having trouble finding an answer to your question. We&rsquo;ve set up that address specifically in response to this situation.</p><p>Use technology to keep in touch. We may not be together physically, but we are all in this together. As always, we are here to support you through this difficult and unprecedented time.</p><p>Please take care,<br />Susan M.

The person affected is in stable condition and self-isolating at home. This individual has not been to campus since
        March 12, so the case poses no imminent danger of exposure to our wider campus community. We will not share any information about this individual&rsquo;s identity out of respect for their privacy, but, of course, we wish them a swift and full
        recovery.
    </p><p>As the number of cases grow in our region, it is reasonable to conclude others within our community also may contract the virus. In the future, we will not update you about individual cases unless potential exposure to campus warrants it.</p><p>This case affirms the absolute necessity to continue following protocols established by the&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a>&nbsp;and the&nbsp;<a href="https://govstatus.egov.com/kycovid19">Kentucky Department for Public Health</a>,
 including frequent hand-washing, social distancing and leaving home only when it&rsquo;s essential. Now, more than ever, our collective health depends on everyone&rsquo;s individual actions. We truly are in this together.</p><p>Your safety and health remain our highest priority. Our administration continues to monitor the COVID-19 pandemic, and updates are posted on this page.&nbsp;</p><p>We ask Bellarmine students, faculty and staff members to self-report COVID-19 confirmations, pending tests and exposures to me through my email:&nbsp;<a href="mailto:mkimble@bellarmine.edu">mkimble@bellarmine.edu</a>. If you experience fever or symptoms
        of respiratory illness, such as cough or shortness of breath, please seek advice by calling your health care provider.</p><p>Thank you all for your continued compassion, grace and understanding during this trying time.</p><p>Stay safe and healthy,<br />Alice Kimble RN, BSN, MS, PhD<br />Director of Health Services</p></div></div>

<div class="mypanel">
<div class="clean">
<h2>Summer 2020 Courses, Registration and Internships</h2>
<p>Bellarmine has decided to move the currently-listed summer courses online. There are a few courses that cannot easily be translated to an online environment and those have been cancelled.  Students in those sections have already been notified.</p>
<p>
The registrar will adjust existing course listings to reflect their online status.</p>
<h2>What are your next steps?</h2>
<p><strong>Students already registered for summer courses:</strong> If you intend to remain enrolled in your summer courses, you do not need to take any action.</p>
<p>
<strong>Students not registered for summer courses:</strong> Review our <a href="https://www.bellarmine.edu/public/2020SU_Class_Schedule_Daily.pdf">summer course schedule</a>&nbsp;to see if there are classes you&rsquo;re interested in taking online. Our Financial Aid website includes information <a href="https://www.bellarmine.edu/financialaid/summerterm/">about summer courses</a>&nbsp;and we will follow up with you soon on our efforts to make these courses as affordable as possible.</p>
<p>
<strong>Summer internships:</strong> If you plan to pursue an internship for academic credit this summer, it must be a remote experience that does not require you to be in-person for your work (this does not pertain to health professions clinicals). There are many employers who offer remote internships and the <a href="/studentaffairs/careercenter">Career Center</a>&nbsp;is available to assist you in this search process. The <a href="https://www.bellarmine.edu/studentaffairs/careercenter/guarantee/">Summer Internship Scholarship</a>&nbsp;is still available to students who have completed BU299 (or a course equivalent), and there is an online section of BU299 in May.</p>
<h2>Summer 2020 Campus Housing</h2>
<p>Summer housing will only be available for students who are experiencing an undue hardship in completing their academic coursework and must live on campus due to personal safety and wellness concerns. All students will have single room accommodations for $50 per week. Please note that food service, if available, will be limited.</p>
<p>
To submit your application for summer housing, please log into your housing portal and select apply for the Summer 2020 term. Please email Residence Life at <a href="mailto:reslife@bellarmine.edu">reslife@bellarmine.edu</a>&nbsp;if you have any questions.</p>

<h2>Student Emergency Fund</h2>
<p><strong>For students who are experiencing financial hardship </strong>as a result of these sudden changes, support may be available through the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bellarmine.edu/studentaffairs/dean/student-emergency-fund/">student emergency aid fund</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Online Courses</h2>
<p><strong>Online courses</strong>, which began March 18, will continue for the rest of the spring and summer semesters, including final exams.&nbsp;Professors and instructors will communicate with students via email about their plans to deliver courses remotely. They will also communicate about internships and clinicals. Our intent is to ensure that our students' academic progress is not impeded.</p>
<p><strong>Student Support Communication Flow for Online Courses:</strong> Faculty should be your first point of contact for support in your online classes.  Faculty should do their best to determine whether an issue is either technical/technological, or academic, and direct you appropriately, as outlined below.
</p>
<p>
<em>Technical/technology issues </em>should be referred to the Technology Support Center (TSC), at <a href="mailto:tsc@bellarmine.edu">tsc@bellarmine.edu</a>, or 502.272.8301.</p>
<p>
<em>Academic-related issues</em> should be referred to the <a href="/studentsuccess">Student Success Center (SSC)</a>. The SSC will further direct or recommend additional resources as needed.  Students can reach the SSC via phone at 502.272.7400, or email at <a href="mailto:studentsuccess@bellarmine.edu">studentsuccess@bellarmine.edu</a>.  Students will also be able to seek support online, via live chat, through the <a href="http://bit.ly/BUonlinesupport">Bellarmine Online Learning Support group in Microsoft Teams</a>.</p>

<p>During this period of global upheaval, Bellarmine recognizes that international students may face special anxiety and concerns about the effects of COVID-19﻿. We want to offer our support and guidance especially during this difficult time. ﻿If you have any concerns about your classes, clinicals, internships, travel, the situation in your home country, or other questions, please contact&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bellarmine.edu/international-services/services/">International Support</a>.</p>
<p>In response to the crisis, Homeland Security is temporarily considering students to be maintaining status while completing courses remotely. There is no requirement that international students remain in the U.S. while classes remain entirely remote. </p>
<p>Travel for the purpose of education is generally considered "essential travel," and when Bellarmine resumes in-person classes, students should be entitled to return with a valid visa and I-20 (F-1 students) or DS-2019 (J-1 students). However, earlier this spring President Trump instituted travel restrictions for anyone present within the last 14 days in China, Iran, Ireland, the U.K., and the Schengen Area. "Essential travel" is not included in the exceptions listed in the president's order and students will be subject to the travel restrictions until they are lifted.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We advise all students to consider the risks of legal or practical barriers to travel (such as limited flight options or further travel restrictions) before choosing to depart the U.S. <strong>You must notify International Support if you are planning to travel outside the U.S. </strong></p>
<p>U.S. embassies around the world are currently closed except for emergencies, making new visas difficult to obtain. However, President Trump's April 22 executive order limiting immigration does not include F-1 or J-1 students, who are considered nonimmigrants according to U.S. laws. New students applying for admission to Bellarmine should contact their Admissions counselor or International Support, especially if you do not already have a valid visa.&nbsp;</p>
<p>All Bellarmine students studying abroad have been asked to return home due to the Department of State's Level 4 worldwide travel advisory. All study abroad opportunities for the summer have been canceled. &nbsp;</p>
