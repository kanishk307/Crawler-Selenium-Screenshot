<h3><a name="312">3/12: Students asked to depart from campus</a> </h3>
<p><strong>Dear Bellarmine University faculty and staff,&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>
I want to thank all of you for your professionalism and flexibility as we continue to grapple with changes necessitated by COVID-19. In particular, I am grateful to faculty who are leaning into the very difficult work of moving their classes online in an exceedingly short amount of time and to the Academic Affairs and IT staff who are supporting this transition.
</p>
<p>
I know that students are asking all of you many questions. We are developing regular email communications to students to provide answers, and we will add all pertinent details to the Bellarmine coronavirus website.
</p>
<p>
Please check that site frequently, as we are continually updating it with information for faculty and staff, as well as current and prospective students and their families.
</p>
<p>I want to reiterate these important dates related to class delivery:</p>
<ul>
    <li>
    Thursday, March 12: On-campus classes are suspended; online classes continue as usual
    </li>
    <li>Saturday, March 14: Students depart residence halls unless they&rsquo;re granted permission to stay
    </li>
    <li>Wednesday, March 18: Classes resume via temporary online delivery modes
    </li>
    <li>Wednesday, April 1: On-campus classes are projected to resume
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
We should now begin preparing for the possibility that faculty and staff may need to work from home as the coronavirus spreads and local K-12 schools consider closing. I have asked all vice presidents to develop continuity plans regarding which functions must be staffed on campus, which may be completed remotely, and what resources will be needed for those working elsewhere.
</p>
<p>
In the meantime, the reality of social distancing has arrived. Whenever possible, please conduct meetings by phone or on the internet, even when you&rsquo;re meeting with others on campus. In-person meetings with small groups in large spaces should happen only as a last resort. We will be following up tomorrow with information to help you with some of the tools available, including the videoconferencing function in Microsoft Teams.
</p>
<p>
Beginning next week, campus food service will be limited to the Palio and partial service in Caf&eacute; Ogle, and campus shuttle service will be suspended. Most university events, and rentals by outside groups, have been canceled or postponed.
</p>
<p>
You will find an FAQ below that addresses some issues related specifically to faculty and staff. If you have other questions, please send them along. I promise to provide frequent communication, including another email tomorrow, as we navigate this new territory together.
</p>
<p>
Stay safe,  <br />
Susan M. Donovan, Ph.D.  <br />
President </p>
<p><strong>FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS <br />
Should I still come to work? </strong><br />
Yes, you should report to work on your regular schedule as long as you are not experiencing COVID-19 symptoms, have not been exposed to someone who has been diagnosed with COVID-19, and are not otherwise ill. </p>
<p>
If you are ill, stay home. The university supports flexibility when staff need to stay home because of illness. If an employee self-isolates (upon return from travel, direction of healthcare provider, etc.), the university recommends making reasonable arrangements for working remotely if possible. Please contact your supervisor for review and prior approval. You should also notify your HR Business Partner (<a href="https://one.bellarmine.edu/facstaffresources/hr/Pages/default.aspx">https://one.bellarmine.edu/facstaffresources/hr/Pages/default.aspx</a>) so they can assist you with paid leave and timekeeping. </p>
<p>
If you are experiencing COVID-19 symptoms, contact your healthcare provider for guidance. You can also download the Humana app, Doctor on Demand, from the Apple App Store or Google Play for online, non-emergency care.
Our top priority is keeping our community safe and healthy. If you are sick, it is best to stay home. Supervisors should not pressure anyone who is ill to come to work.</p>
<p>
<strong>What if my child&rsquo;s school or regular care provider is closed? </strong><br />
Please notify your supervisor and discuss whether working from home is possible. If you are unable to work remotely, you should discuss with your supervisor whether you can work a flexible schedule (e.g., work in the evening or on a weekend). If these two options are unavailable to you, you will still be paid, as the university is committed to not allowing this situation to create financial suffering. Supervisors: Your HR Business Partner (<a href="https://one.bellarmine.edu/facstaffresources/hr/Pages/default.aspx">https://one.bellarmine.edu/facstaffresources/hr/Pages/default.aspx</a>) is available to discuss this with you.
</p>
<p>
<strong>How will I be paid during this time of uncertainty? </strong><br />
Bellarmine&rsquo;s pay practices will continue as usual. Whether you are on leave due to your own COVID-19 illness, your child is out of school/childcare due to school/childcare closure, or the campus officially closes, you will be paid. If you are on biweekly pay (hourly), you will track your actual work time on the timekeeping system as usual. You should record virus-related absence as OPTO. Supervisors: Be sure you review and approve all timekeeping records by the payroll deadlines to ensure timely payments. </p>
<p>
<strong>What if I supervise student workers? </strong><br />
Student employees who remain in Louisville may continue working on campus if they wish to do so. Those who leave Louisville or prefer to remain off campus are receiving instructions for work that can be done remotely. When student workers return, we encourage employees who supervise them to help them make up their hours, particularly when it affects work-study funds.
</p>
<p>
<strong>What if the university closes? </strong><br />
In the event the university closes, be on the lookout for additional communications. It is prudent to begin making plans for remote work.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Who can I see if I&rsquo;m having anxiety or other concerns? </strong><br />
Please contact your healthcare provider or the Human Development Company, our Employee Assistance Program, at 502-589-4357. HDC counselors are available to help you at no cost.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Can employees wear a face mask if they choose to? </strong><br />
The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) does not recommend the universal use of face masks to prevent acquiring COVID-19. However, this is a personal health decision. A supervisor should not encourage or discourage wearing a mask.
</p>
<p>
<strong>What should I do if one of my employees comes to work with a cough or other concerning symptoms? </strong><br />
Only a medical professional can diagnose an illness and provide care instructions. However, supervisors can err on the side of caution by advising employees who are displaying symptoms of illness to go home and suggesting they contact their health care provider.  </p>
<p>
<strong>What should I do if an employee shows signs of illness but does not want to go home? </strong><br />
Please call your HR Business Partner to discuss the situation, as the circumstances will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis. </p>

<p><strong>Dear Bellarmine University faculty and staff, </strong> </p>
<p>
As the COVID-19 situation continues to prompt closures nationwide to slow the spread of the virus, we have decided that starting Monday, most employees should work from home unless their on-campus presence is designated essential by their vice president.
</p>
<p>
Health-sensitive staff deemed essential (anyone age 60 or older and/or those with diabetes, heart disease, lung disease, kidney failure or other chronic major medical conditions) or those caring for health-sensitive relatives should seek guidance from Human Resources. There is also the opportunity for essential employees to develop rotations.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Work from home </strong><br />
It is critical for all employees to monitor email and phone calls daily, as we will continue to share updates via email. It&rsquo;s also crucial for every employee to enter time worked promptly and accurately and for supervisors to approve time promptly. Bellarmine&rsquo;s pay practices will continue as usual. Whether you are on leave due to your own COVID-19 illness, your child is out of school/childcare due to school/childcare closure, or the campus officially closes, you will be paid. If you are on biweekly pay (hourly), you will track your actual work time on the timekeeping system as usual. You should record virus-related absence as OPTO. We will communicate more about this next week.  It is important that the work of the University continue as if employees were at work. </p>
<p>
We will also continue to update the Bellarmine coronavirus website. </p>
<p>
<strong>Athletics </strong><br />
Athletics has suspended all competition after consultation with our conferences and the NCAA&rsquo;s decision to cancel championship events. We know this is hugely disappointing to our student-athletes, especially our seniors, and to Knights Nation. </p>
<p>
Please continue to be sensitive to the needs of all students as we prepare for resumption of classes online on Wednesday, March 18, and for registration, which will begin on schedule on Monday.
</p>
<p>
Again, many thanks to all faculty for pitching in so willingly to learn new ways of delivering instruction so that course delivery can continue; to Dr. Adam Elias, Gabrielle Read Jasnoff and Janice Poston for their coaching; and to Eric Satterly and the Information Technology team for keeping things running smoothly. </p>
<p>
Below are some resources gathered by Eric Satterly&rsquo;s team to help all of us prepare. He asks that I remind you to be hyper-vigilant with your passwords and wary of suspicious emails, especially those with attachments. If there is one group that welcomes times of crisis, it&rsquo;s the hacker community. Here is a story that outlines some of the ways cybercriminals have been preying on COVID-19 fear to steal people&rsquo;s data: <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/hackers-are-using-coronavirus-concerns-to-trick-you-cybersecurity-pros-warn-2020-03-12">https://www.marketwatch.com/story/hackers-are-using-coronavirus-concerns-to-trick-you-cybersecurity-pros-warn-2020-03-12

<p>
<strong>Dear members of the Bellarmine community, </strong> </p>
<p>
These are unusual and challenging times. The campus is not the same without students and faculty and staff engaging in the most noble work of educating our students, engaging them in the gritty issues of our day and enjoying one another&rsquo;s company. One of the best parts of my job is being able to watch &ldquo;miracles happen every day&rdquo; as I observe our students develop into wonderfully engaged and ethical leaders.  I am especially sorry for our seniors who are commendable leaders in their own right and will change this world for the better. I have no doubt that this is true.
</p>
<p>
In the past week, our faculty and staff have responded swiftly and with amazing resilience to ensure that our classes are able to move online this week to ensure that the educational experience continues on track toward on time degree completion and for each and every student to work toward completing their coursework. Trust me, this takes incredible work, persistence and adaptability.  It will also take incredible work, persistence and adaptability on the part of each of our students throughout the university. I thank you for your patience, your creativity and your eagerness to learn.
</p>
<p>
I&rsquo;d like to thank students for their understanding and Residence Life staff for their help as most students moved out of the residence halls over the weekend. Thanks also to the Public Safety officers who volunteered to drive some students home. At the recommendation of the governor&rsquo;s office that all restaurants close except for carry-out, Food Services will be operating on a carry-out basis only. I appreciate our Sodexo employees and the other staff members who are working on campus to keep things running smoothly and safely.
</p>
<p>
We are fortunate to live in a time where technology allows us to remain connected even while we are apart. It does not capture the full Bellarmine spirit, but I encourage you to be respectful of our faculty and staff as we take on these hurdles. There will be some natural mistakes I am sure, but we are working to make this as smooth a transition as possible. Please help us.
</p>
<p>
As noted last week, Summer/Fall 2020 course registration began today, and classes will resume online on Wednesday, March 18. Professors and instructors should have communicated with students via email by now about their plans to deliver courses remotely. The Registrar&rsquo;s Office will be available to assist with registration questions via email at <a href="mailto:registrar@bellarmine.edu">registrar@bellarmine.edu</a>. Advising is available through your faculty advisor or through the Student Success Center. We will continue to update the Bellarmine coronavirus website with information specific to students, faculty and staff. If you have concerns that are not addressed there, please send them to <a href="mailto:questions@bellarmine.edu">questions@bellarmine.edu</a>.
</p>
<p>
Being isolated can cause feelings of anxiety and/or depression. Remember to take a few minutes each day to get some fresh air and exercise. You can reach Bellarmine&rsquo;s Counseling Center for consultation and crisis management during normal business hours at 502.272.8480. Students can access <a href="https://www.bellarmine.edu/studentaffairs/counselingcenter/services/">online resources </a>at any point, and faculty and staff can access the <a href="https://www.humandev.com">Employee Assistance Program (EAP) here</a>. </p>
<p>
This is an unprecedented situation that our community is handling with professionalism and grace. </p>
<p>
Bellarmine University is known for our commitment to community service. Ordinarily, we frame that service in terms of going out into the community and helping others. But these are not ordinary times. Now, the best way that we can help others is to stay in our homes, slow the spread of the virus, and try to keep our healthcare system from being overwhelmed. </p>
<p>
Please take care, <br />

</div><div class='sfContentBlock'><h3><a name="317">3/17: Update closing Residence Halls March 21, Work from home</a></h3>
<p>
<strong>Dear members of the Bellarmine community,&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>I am writing to you today to update you on some important decisions. These obviously are not decisions we wanted to make, but the national situation regarding COVID-19 has changed significantly in the last 24 to 36 hours.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I know these precautions will be met with frustration and sadness, and believe me, everyone in the faculty and administration shares these feelings. We are sorry we will not be able to deliver the meaningful experiences that are normally part of the spring semester. It may be especially difficult to understand why we are taking what seem like radical steps when right now, the effects of COVID-19 aren&rsquo;t readily apparent in our city, and when people the age of our traditional student population don&rsquo;t seem to be severely affected.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>But this virus is real. It is unlike anything any of us has experienced in our lifetimes. We don&rsquo;t know everything about it, but we do know that its incubation period is about 14 days. I suspect that very soon its effects will be all too apparent.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) situation rapidly evolves, we have made several very difficult decisions:&nbsp;</p>
<p>Online courses, which begin tomorrow, March 18, will continue for the rest of the Spring 2020 semester. Academic Affairs is working with faculty to plan delivery of final exams.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To support the Center for Disease Control and Prevention&rsquo;s <a href="https://nam10.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fcoronavirus%2F2019-ncov%2Fcommunity%2Flarge-events%2Fmass-gatherings-ready-for-covid-19.html&amp;data=02%7C01%7Cecongleton01%40bellarmine.edu%7Cbe1821eb5e4842be147d08d7cab91215%7C5290229cd9f145dca0d4263790f731fa%7C1%7C0%7C637200768576354115&amp;sdata=1j0KQamyjlacM9DHW0axXNwAxq8gIB6Z1EJOSIqsGBM%3D&amp;reserved=0">updated social distancing guidance</a>, residence halls will close to students on Saturday, March 21 at 3 p.m. Details regarding hardship requests are below, but we will work on the premise that our students should be at home unless it is a risk to personal safety.&nbsp;</p>
<p>All university events through May 15, including Senior Week activities, have been canceled or postponed.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Commencement, scheduled for May 9, will be postponed. The graduation regalia distribution event scheduled for April 9 is canceled. We will be in touch with the Bellarmine Society and graduate students to seek guidance on our Commencement in late summer. We hope to announce the new dates for Commencement activities by the end of this week. Official graduation dates and availability of official final transcripts will not be affected by the postponement.&nbsp;</p>
<p>One of our faculty experts, Dr. Karen Golemboski, has answered a number of questions related to COVID-19. You can read more from Dr. Golemboski <a href="https://www.bellarmine.edu/news/archives/2020/03/13/karen-golemboski-immunology-expert-coronavirus/">here</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>We will continue to update our <a href="https://www.bellarmine.edu/coronavirus/">coronavirus information page</a> with the latest information for you, including up-to-date info on how to access campus services. You may also email <a href="mailto:questions@bellarmine.edu">questions@bellarmine.edu</a> if you&rsquo;re having trouble finding an answer to your question. We&rsquo;ve set up that address specifically in response to this situation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Use technology to keep in touch. We may not be together physically, but we are all in this together. As always, we are here to support you through this difficult and unprecedented time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please take care,&nbsp;<br />

President&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>CURRENT STUDENTS&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>With the on-campus experience ending for the semester, the residence halls will close to students on Saturday, March 21 at 3 p.m. to allow for maximum social distancing. Hardship requests for students who remain on campus and hope to remain beyond that date (even those who previously received permission to stay) must be completed on this form&nbsp;<a href="https://bellarmine.wufoo.com/forms/hardship-request/">https://bellarmine.wufoo.com/forms/hardship-request/</a> by Thursday, March 19, at 3 p.m. We will work on the premise that our students should be at home unless it is a risk to personal safety.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Limited campus services will be available to students who remain on campus after Saturday, March 21, including boxed meals available for pick-up from the Palio. Caf&eacute; Ogle will close tomorrow, and the bookstore&rsquo;s hours will be reduced to 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. on weekdays.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Residential students who wish to return to collect personal belongings should sign up for a check-out time. Students may begin to check out from the halls beginning Saturday, April 4. Please use this link <a href="https://bellarmine.wufoo.com/forms/spring-2020-express-checkout-sign-up-request/">https://bellarmine.wufoo.com/forms/spring-2020-express-checkout-sign-up-request/</a> to request a check-out time. If you are unable to return to campus in early April, we will work with you. If you have essential items in your room that you need sooner, please email <a href="mailto:reslife@bellarmine.edu">reslife@bellarmine.edu</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For students who are experiencing financial hardship as a result of these sudden changes, support may be available through the <a href="https://www.bellarmine.edu/studentaffairs/dean/student-emergency-fund/">student emergency aid fund</a>. &nbsp;</p>
<p>We are working to address the issue of housing and meal plan credits. We know this is important, and we will communicate with you as soon as we have answers.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>FACULTY &amp; STAFF&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Our plan remains for most employees to work from home while essential employees work on campus as needed. As we transition to completing the semester via online instruction, essential personnel will remain on campus to provide support, primarily via email, videoconference or phone. Standard office hours for on-campus employees will become 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. until further notice. Our vice presidents are communicating with employees in their divisions about these work plans.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Effective today, March 17, academic and administrative buildings will lock at 6 p.m. and will require swipe-card access. If you need assistance after hours and you have authorization to access a building, please contact Public Safety at 502-272-7777.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As indicated previously, any employee with certain health considerations <a href="https://nam10.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fcoronavirus%2F2019-ncov%2Fspecific-groups%2Fhigh-risk-complications.html&amp;data=02%7C01%7Cecongleton01%40bellarmine.edu%7Cbe1821eb5e4842be147d08d7cab91215%7C5290229cd9f145dca0d4263790f731fa%7C1%7C0%7C637200768576364114&amp;sdata=ccSyrVlq%2BqGTgJLas39M%2ByyBHH5FILfhLl%2BybkayImI%3D&amp;reserved=0">outlined by the CDC</a> should speak to Human Resources if they have concerns about reporting to campus for a work assignment.&nbsp;</p>


</div><div class='sfContentBlock'><h3><a name="319">3/19: Commencement Postponed</a></h3>
<p><strong>Dear Fall 2019 and Summer 2019 Bellarmine Graduates, &nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>I am writing to update you on some important and difficult decisions prompted by the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) situation. &nbsp;</p>
<p>To support the Center for Disease Control and Prevention&rsquo;s updated social distancing guidance, all university events through May 15 have been canceled or postponed. &nbsp;</p>

I know the postponement of Commencement will be met with frustration and sadness, and believe me, everyone in the faculty and administration shares these feelings.

<p>As always, we are here to support you through this difficult and unprecedented time. We will continue to update <a href="https://www.bellarmine.edu/coronavirus/">our coronavirus information page</a> with the latest information.

</div><div class='sfContentBlock'><h3><a name="320">3/20: Knights helping Knights</a></h3>
<p><strong>Dear Bellarmine community, &nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m writing to ask you to help some of your fellow Knights who are in particular peril due to the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. &nbsp;</p>
<p>As most of you know, we have sent students home and canceled or postponed all campus activities to help slow the spread of the virus. Online instruction, which began on March 18, will continue for the rest of the semester. While faculty, staff and students have reacted quickly and nimbly, these changes have been jarring, particularly for our seniors, who are missing out on many anticipated milestone moments. &nbsp;</p>
<p>But for some students, this unprecedented global crisis is leading to unprecedented personal crises. Remember, one-fourth of our students are Pell Grant eligible, meaning they are among the neediest students in the nation. Some of them lack internet access or other tools needed for online instruction, for example. Others may be facing food insecurity issues at home. As they or their parents lose their jobs, they may struggle to pay the rent. &nbsp;</p>
<p>We must help these students now, in this time of urgent need. To do so, we are postponing our annual Day of Giving and launching an immediate campaign for our students. We are calling it Knights Helping Knights&mdash;because that is what we do. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The campaign will launch at noon on Monday, March 23, and will bring the Bellarmine community together to support our most desperately affected students through the crisis. Your support of the Knights Helping Knights Fund will help provide emergency assistance such as medication, internet access, food, scholarships, and other emergency needs we haven&rsquo;t even identified yet as the situation evolves. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how long the coronavirus pandemic will last, or what its lasting effects will be; no one does. What I do know is that I can count on the Bellarmine family to take care of its own. Already, our Student Government Association has voted to donate funds in an unused travel account to this effort, for instance. Hospitality is a core value at Bellarmine; these times call for what one of our Student Affairs professionals has termed &ldquo;radical hospitality.&rdquo; &nbsp;</p>
<p>The coronavirus may have pulled us apart physically, but we can still come together in this crucial way to support our neediest Knights. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you so much for your generosity in this time of uncertainty. We appreciate you now more than ever. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sincerely, &nbsp;<br />
Susan M. Donovan, Ph.D. &nbsp;<br />
President &nbsp;</p>


</div><div class='sfContentBlock'><h3><a name="48">4/8: Commencement Announcement</a></h3>
<p><strong>Dear students,&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Every so often, the world unfolds a tremendous challenge, and a generation is called to meet it with courage and grace. Such are our times. Such has been the exemplary response of our rising Bellarmine graduates. I know this has not been easy, but I&rsquo;m proud of you.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Fall 2020 Commencement&nbsp;</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Necessary precautions to prevent the spread of COVID-19 delayed our May commencement, but I&rsquo;m pleased to announce that, as promised, a date has been set. The rescheduled commencement ceremony will be December 19, 2020, in Freedom Hall for students who complete degree requirements in Summer and Fall 2019; Spring and Summer 2020; and Fall 2020. The exact ceremony time will be announced later.&nbsp;</li>
    <li>While I know it&rsquo;s not what you initially planned, it will be a momentous occasion. We will celebrate your tremendous accomplishments in the face of adversity. You will have your cap and gown, pictures with classmates, and the joyous feeling of a job well done.&nbsp; &nbsp;</li>
    <li>Students who complete degree requirements at the end of this spring semester will still have an April 30, 2020 degree date posted on their transcripts. We will communicate with you about the availability of your diploma at a later date.&nbsp;</li>
    <li>The Registrar&rsquo;s Office will reach out in October to ask you to RSVP for the new ceremony. In the coming months, we&rsquo;ll release additional information as our plans are solidified.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Delivery of Remote Teaching &nbsp;</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>I&rsquo;ve been pleased with everyone&rsquo;s ability to adapt to our temporary new learning environment. As you&rsquo;ve experienced first hand, our incredible faculty members have worked tirelessly to ensure that our education continued on a remote learning basis, so tuition and fees will not be refunded.&nbsp;</li>
    <li>For questions about your account, feel free to contact the Office of Student Accounts at <a href="mailto:studentaccounts@bellarmine.edu">studentaccounts@bellarmine.edu</a> or 502.272.8264.&nbsp;</li>
    <li>For questions about financial aid, feel free to contact the Office of Financial Aid at <a href="mailto:finaid@bellarmine.edu">finaid@bellarmine.edu</a> or 502.272.7300.&nbsp; &nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Student Emergency Fund&nbsp;</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>For students who are experiencing financial hardship as a result of these sudden changes, support may be available through the <a href="https://www.bellarmine.edu/studentaffairs/dean/student-emergency-fund/">student emergency aid fund</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Enrollment Outlook&nbsp;</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Some of you have asked how this pandemic is affecting our work to enroll new students. I&rsquo;m happy to report that our numbers for fall starts are largely on target and tracking positively in some instances in comparison to last year. This is very comforting, especially in light of the uncertainty that COVID-19 is causing for prospective students and their families, which I know you&rsquo;re also experiencing.&nbsp;</li>
    <li>On the undergraduate side, we have admitted 9 percent more first-year students and 7 percent more transfer students than at this time last year. The numbers of those who have committed are down very slightly &ndash; about 6 percent &ndash; but we have extended our deposit deadline because of the current public health crisis.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
    <li>On the graduate side, our applications for the Fall 2020 semester are up 49% over this time last year. We&rsquo;ll have a better sense of the impact on eventual enrollment as the fall semester gets closer.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>A deep sense of community was valued at our university&rsquo;s founding, and has been so finely woven throughout Bellarmine&rsquo;s life, it is intrinsic to our very being. Now, more than ever, we must find unique ways to honor and strengthen our relationships we hold so dear.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>As we know, this is Holy Week for Christians and Passover for our Jewish members. For the Muslim members of our community, Ramadan will soon arrive. As a Catholic University, Easter Sunday brings us a sense of hope and renewal. I hope that you continue to be hopeful. Individually and collectively, we will rise out of this crisis, stronger and more resilient.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please take some time to reflect upon the many things for which we are grateful. My prayers are with any and all of you experiencing loss of any kind. I know that the Bellarmine community is trying to extend <em>cura personalis </em>to each one of you. Please know that you are in my prayers over Easter and throughout this crisis.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>During this weekend, I encourage you to take a break from your studies. Our academic calendar allows us a pause to recognize the importance of this time. It&rsquo;s an opportunity to give yourself some rest and spend time in communion with your loved ones, whether they&rsquo;re near you or at a distance.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please take care of yourself and one another.&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>In Veritatis Amore</em>,&nbsp;<br />
Susan M. Donovan, Ph.D.&nbsp;<br />

</div><div class='sfContentBlock'><h3><a name="422">4/22: Financial Impact Statement</a></h3>
<p>Dear Bellarmine employees,<br />
&nbsp;<br />
As we continue to respond to the changes necessitated by the ongoing COVID-19 public health crisis, one thing hasn&rsquo;t changed: our shared commitment to respect, seeing the good in each other, trust and candor. These values have shaped our collaborative discussions about Bellarmine&rsquo;s future since my first Town Hall in the fall of 2017.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Since the university&rsquo;s founding, the Bellarmine community has had to unite in the face of hardship on several occasions. Because of the way the university dealt with these challenges, Bellarmine emerged stronger in every instance, and this year will be no exception. We have lost revenues for many reasons as a result of COVID-19, including the cancellation of revenue-producing events, the impact on our fundraising, financial adjustments for unused room and board, and the cost of doing business in this new reality. At the same time, we have risen to the challenge&hellip; moving over 1,000 sections, hundreds of faculty, and thousands of students to remote learning platforms in less than a week! We&rsquo;ve also been very successful in migrating university support functions to Teams. While we will continue to innovate, to explore new revenue opportunities, and to fundraise, it is now apparent that more drastic measures will be required of us for the remainder of this fiscal year and the start of the next one.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
We have reviewed multiple financial scenarios based on forecasting the impact of COVID-19 and how Bellarmine might thrive in a post-pandemic environment. <strong>As part of this effort,</strong> <strong>in order to ensure Bellarmine has a stronger future, we are considering a range of difficult options</strong>, including &ndash; but not limited to &ndash; reducing operating expenses, furloughs, a hiring freeze other than commitments made and the most urgent needs, and compensation adjustments. We are committed to <strong>maintaining current health insurance benefits</strong> for all members of our community.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Effective May 1, 2020, I will be the first to take a salary reduction of 10 percent, and our vice presidents will take 5 percent reductions.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Early next week, I will provide more details, as guided by our human resource professionals and in consultation with the Cabinet and Board of Trustees. I know that any decisions we make will cause anxiety and concern. I would not consider these difficult choices if the needs were not so urgent.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Our Strategic Plan calls on us to be responsible and effective stewards of the university&rsquo;s resources, ensuring our long-term financial stability so that we can make a Bellarmine education accessible to all students. The hard decisions we make now may spare us some of the more severe impacts we&rsquo;re seeing at other institutions. Fortunately, before COVID-19 arrived, we were in a position of good financial health, thanks in part to the work of everyone in our community the past couple of years.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
When life as normal resumes after COVID-19 social distancing measures end, I believe that Bellarmine will emerge as a stronger, more vibrant institution that will once again be in good financial health. I appreciate all that each of you are doing in the meantime to continue to educate our students in mind, body and spirit. We are a resilient community, and we will get through this together. Please know that you and your families are in my thoughts and prayers.<br />

</div><div class='sfContentBlock'><h3><a name="58">5/8: Fall 2020 and Summer Courses</a></h3>
<p>Dear Bellarmine students,</p>
<p>With grades posted and final exams complete, I&rsquo;m sure we&rsquo;re all happy to have this spring semester behind us. We look forward to welcoming returning students back to Bellarmine in the fall. If you have any doubt about campus reopening, we encourage you to put those thoughts out of your head, as&nbsp;<strong>we are moving forward with plans to return to campus this fall.</strong></p>
<p>The health and safety of our campus community remain our top priorities. While we do not have all the answers at the moment, we have a contingency planning committee working on detailed plans to ensure that the experience we offer meets our usual high-quality standards.&nbsp;A current student is serving on this committee.</p>
<p>To be sure, we understand that we will be operating under a new normal in the fall as we follow public health guidelines announced by the Commonwealth of Kentucky. The need to ensure the safety of our community will guide our work and any needed accommodations will be made on a case by case basis. We will update you regularly as our plans are developed.</p>
<p>We educate students in mind, body and spirit, and we know there is great value in being on campus&mdash; together&mdash; where students learn not only from professors in the classroom, but also from extracurricular activities and from the opportunity to interact with people whose backgrounds and opinions differ from their own.</p>
<p><strong>SUMMER COURSES</strong></p>
<p>As we plan ahead for an on-campus fall experience, remember that you can stay on track for graduation or get ahead by&nbsp;<a href="/admissions/undergraduate/summer">enrolling in online summer courses</a>. In light of the current circumstances, we are awarding a summer 2020 grant that is $300 per credit hour less than our regular $950 undergraduate summer credit hour tuition rate. The summer 2020 grant is automatically applied to a student&rsquo;s account when they enroll in summer courses. In addition, federal financial aid may be available. If you have any questions or need assistance, feel free to contact our&nbsp;<a href="/financialaid/summerterm">Office of Financial Aid</a>&nbsp;at&nbsp;<a href="mailto:finaid@bellarmine.edu">finaid@bellarmine.edu</a>&nbsp;or 502.272.7300.</p>
<p>This has been an especially challenging and emotional semester for graduating students. As you know, we have postponed our own commencement ceremony until Dec. 19, but in keeping with &ldquo;the Bellarmine difference,&rdquo; we will hold our first-ever virtual Toast to Our Graduates on&nbsp;<a href="https://nam10.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2FBellarmineU&amp;data=02%7C01%7Cecongleton01%40bellarmine.edu%7C55748294b33547ef60d408d7f36a082d%7C5290229cd9f145dca0d4263790f731fa%7C1%7C0%7C637245509067387062&amp;sdata=Ut0M4rRUiZzIubb1f2uTTq9Z%2B8Fu7ZY4mMOlatk%2BCEI%3D&amp;reserved=0" title="Original URL: https://www.facebook.com/BellarmineU Click to follow link.">Bellarmine University&rsquo;s Facebook page</a><span style="text-decoration: underline;">&nbsp;</span>at 1 p.m. this Saturday, May 9, the original commencement date. We encourage you to log in and join us. The Bellarmine community is a family, and we couldn&rsquo;t let such a milestone pass without a celebration.</p>
<p>Thank you so much for your patience, understanding and flexibility as we deal with this challenging situation. We can&rsquo;t wait to see you in the fall!</p>
<p>Go Knights!</p>

<p><strong>Dear Bellarmine Knights,&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>In addition to regularly updating the <a href="https://www.bellarmine.edu/coronavirus/">University&rsquo;s Coronavirus (COVID-19) Web page</a>, the University will be providing with regular communication via email and social media updates to address common questions. Please consult social media pages for various offices and the University COVID-19 web site for information.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Among the reasons why we shifted away from face-to-face delivery of courses was to encourage social distancing, to minimize situations in which members of our community could be exposed to COVDID-19 and to slow the spread. Social distancing means remaining out of congregate settings, avoiding mass gatherings, and maintaining distance (6 feet) from others when possible. Please keep this in mind.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Key dates:&nbsp;</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Thursday, March 12: on-campus classes are suspended; online classes continue as usual&nbsp;</li>
    <li>Saturday, March 14: students depart residence halls unless they receive permission to stay&nbsp;</li>

</div><div class='sfContentBlock'><h3><a name="413">4/13: Summer Courses Online and Housing Announcement</a></h3>
<p><strong>Dear Bellarmine Students,&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>I hope this message finds you safe and healthy. I want to take this opportunity to update you on two important issues: Summer course delivery and summer campus housing. We feel it is important to give you as much advance notice as possible so you can plan your summer accordingly.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Summer 2020 Courses, Registration and Internships&nbsp;</strong><br />
Given the circumstances, Bellarmine University will conduct all summer courses via online instruction.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For the most part, currently-listed summer courses will be delivered online. There are a few courses that cannot easily be translated to an online environment and have been cancelled. Students in those sections have already been notified.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The registrar will adjust existing course listings to reflect their online status.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>What are your next steps?&nbsp;</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Students already registered for summer courses: If you intend to remain enrolled in your summer courses, you do not need to take any action.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li>Students not registered for summer courses: Review our <a href="https://www.bellarmine.edu/public/2020SU_Class_Schedule_Daily.pdf">summer course schedule</a> to see if there are classes you&rsquo;re interested in taking online. Our Financial Aid website includes <a href="https://www.bellarmine.edu/financialaid/summerterm/">information about summer courses</a> and we will follow up with you soon on our efforts to make these courses as affordable as possible.&nbsp;</li>
    <li>Summer internships: If you plan to pursue an internship for academic credit this summer, it must be a remote experience that does not require you to be in-person for your work (this does not pertain to health professions clinicals). There are many employers who offer remote internships and the <a href="https://www.bellarmine.edu/studentaffairs/careercenter/">Career Center</a> is available to assist you in this search process. The <a href="https://www.bellarmine.edu/studentaffairs/careercenter/guarantee/">Summer Internship Scholarship</a> is still available to students who have completed BU299 (or a course equivalent), and there is an online section of BU299 in May.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Summer 2020 Campus Housing&nbsp;</strong><br />
Summer housing will only be available for students who are experiencing an undue hardship in completing their academic coursework and must live on campus due to personal safety and wellness concerns.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
    <li>All students will have single room accommodations for $50 per week. &nbsp;</li>
    <li>Food service, if available, will be limited. &nbsp;</li>
    <li>To submit your application for summer housing, please log into your housing portal and select apply for the Summer 2020 term.&nbsp;</li>
    <li>Please email Residence Life at <a href="mailto:reslife@bellarmine.edu">reslife@bellarmine.edu</a> if you have any questions.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>While online learning is not our preferred mode of delivery for many classes, circumstances are such that step is necessary to ensure your health and safety and to permit you to continue to stay on track academically. I remain very optimistic that we will return to Bellarmine-as-Normal in time. Until then, however, I hope that you will take advantage of the opportunity to continue your studies with us this summer. If you have any questions about summer courses, or other issues related to Bellarmine&rsquo;s response to COVID-19, you can email <a href="mailto:questions@bellarmine.edu">questions@bellarmine.edu</a>. Thank you.&nbsp;</p>

</div><div class='sfContentBlock'><h2>Emails from the Business Office</h2>


</div><div class='sfContentBlock'><h3><a name="414">4/14 Financial Adjustment Memo</a></h3>
<p><strong>Dear Bellarmine student,&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>You&rsquo;re receiving this email because you lived in a residence hall and/or had a meal plan in the Spring 2020 semester. We appreciate your patience as we finalized a plan for partial room and board financial adjustments resulting from the COVID-19 global pandemic, when Bellarmine asked current students to leave the residence halls to comply with CDC social distancing recommendations.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>Bellarmine has committed to providing financial adjustments to your student account. The university will email each student the exact calculation of their adjustment by April 20. These adjustments will be calculated on an individual basis based on the date you checked out of the halls and/or your meal plan balances (see attachment for more details). These adjustments will be made with no action required on your part.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Returning Students&nbsp;</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>All returning residential students will receive a credit to your student account for the fall 2020 semester. It will show up on your estimated bill in June/July as part of your fall financial aid package.&nbsp;</li>
    <li>All adjustments will first apply to any outstanding balances owed to the university. If your account is paid in full, the credit can be used for tuition, fees, room, board, and other charges for the coming 2020-2021 academic year.&nbsp;</li>
    <li>Returning commuter students with unused block meal plan swipes, flex dollars, and bonus bucks will see those funds roll forward. They can be used in the summer, fall, and next spring.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Graduating Students&nbsp;</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Students scheduled to graduate in May 2020 will receive a credit to your current (Spring 2020) account for any unused room and/or board.&nbsp;</li>
    <li>All adjustments will first apply to any outstanding balances owed to the university. If your account is paid in full, this will result in a refund to you within 14 days of the financial adjustment to your account, in accordance with federal regulations.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>Based on when you departed the residence halls, financial adjustments will be made to your Spring 2020 room and board (based on your residence hall and meal plan, less any used flex dollars) using this calculation:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
    <li>March 11-14, 2020 = 40% adjustment&nbsp;</li>
    <li>March 15-21, 2020 = 35% adjustment&nbsp;</li>
    <li>March 22-31, 2020 = 30% adjustment&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>Students in housing beyond March 31 will not receive consideration for the prorated credit of room and board.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Students on a full or partial scholarship that includes room and board, resident assistants, Bellarmine Scholars, Athletes, and others receiving financial aid to support for housing or meal plan costs will be ineligible for a credit or will receive a prorated credit. Any adjustments that result in a credit will be refunded to the source of the aid.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you have questions about this financial adjustment plan, please first review the attached FAQ. If your question isn't answered there, contact the Office of Student Accounts at <a href="mailto:studentaccounts@bellarmine.edu">studentaccounts@bellarmine.edu</a> or 502.272.8264. Thank you for your patience and understanding as we complete these calculations.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Should the state or federal government make any new decisions regarding room and board adjustments to college and university students, we reserve the right to modify any of the actions outlined above or in the attached FAQ. The financial adjustment is non-negotiable and there is no appeals process for the adjustment amount.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We look forward to our next opportunity to see you, either as we celebrate your graduation or as we welcome you back to campus when face-to-face instruction is able to resume.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
Sincerely,&nbsp;<br />

<h3><a name="4142">4/14 Attached FAQ</a></h3>
<p><strong>How are you calculating my financial adjustment for room and board?</strong>&nbsp;<br />
Students who completed the express checkout process will receive an adjustment of room and board costs based on your residence hall and meal plan, reflecting the date your checkout form was submitted.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Financial adjustment to your Spring 2020 room and board (based on your residence hall and meal plan, less any used flex dollars), based on your checkout date:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
    <li>March 11-14, 2020 = 40% adjustment&nbsp;</li>
    <li>March 15-21, 2020 = 35% adjustment&nbsp;</li>
    <li>March 22-31, 2020 = 30% adjustment&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>Students in housing beyond March 31 will not receive consideration for the prorated credit of room and board.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Each adjustment must be individually calculated based on your current room, meal plan, and used flex dollars, but the percentages above should allow you to determine your approximate financial adjustment. Once you receive the email detailing your personalized adjustment calculation, email Residence Life at <a href="mailto:reslife@bellarmine.edu">reslife@bellarmine.edu</a>&nbsp;if you have any questions about your recorded move-out date.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>What if I left the residence halls without completing the express checkout process?&nbsp;</strong><br />
Residents who did not complete an express checkout form and did not complete a housing hardship request will receive an adjustment based on a departure date of March 21, 2020.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>What if I'm not returning to Bellarmine in the fall?&nbsp;</strong><br />
Credit issued to students who are not graduating must be applied to costs associated with the 20-21 academic year; credits not utilized for this purpose will be forfeited.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Should the state or federal government make any new decisions regarding room and board adjustments to college and university students, we reserve the right to modify any of the actions outlined above or in the email you received with this document on April 14, 2020. The financial adjustment is non-negotiable and there is no appeals process for the adjustment amount.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><a name="515">5/15 COVID-19 Notification</a></h3>
<p><strong>A note from our Director of Health Services, Alice Kimble:</strong></p>
<p>Dear staff and faculty,
</p>
<p>
I wanted to inform you that an essential employee who was working on campus as recently as May 7 has tested positive for COVID-19. The person affected is in stable condition and self-isolating at home.
</p>
<p>
We offer this member of our Bellarmine family our deepest wishes for a full and fast recovery.
</p>
<p>
Out of respect for our employee&rsquo;s privacy, we will not divulge personal health information. However, all co-workers in the affected department have been notified of the situation. Those who have been in contact with the employee &ndash; within six feet for more than 15 minutes &ndash; have been asked to self-quarantine and contact their healthcare provider.
</p>
<p>
To support effective contact tracing, we ask all faculty and staff members to self-report COVID-19 confirmations, pending tests and exposures to me through my email: <a href="mailto:mkimble@bellarmine.edu">mkimble@bellarmine.edu</a>. If you experience fever or symptoms of respiratory illness, such as cough or shortness of breath, please seek advice by calling your health care provider.
</p>
<p>
Bellarmine&rsquo;s campus is currently open only for employees identified as essential; all other employees are required to continue working remotely. Essential employees must complete a health screening by filling out this form prior to arriving on campus or at their respective work station. If you are unable to complete this form remotely, please visit the Office of Public Safety on the ground level of Centro's Treece Hall upon your arrival to campus.
</p>
<p>
If you are a non-essential employee and need to visit campus, please contact the Office of Public Safety at 502-272-7777 or <a href="mailto:security@bellarmine.edu">security@bellarmine.edu</a>&nbsp;for more information.
</p>
<p>
This case affirms the absolute necessity to continue following protocols established by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Kentucky Department for Public Health, including frequent hand-washing, social distancing and leaving home only when it&rsquo;s essential.
</p>
<p>
As the number of cases grow in our region, it is reasonable to conclude others within our community also may contract the virus. We will continue to update you about individual cases only when potential exposure to campus warrants it.
</p>
<p>Stay safe and healthy,<br />
Alice Kimble RN, BSN, MS, PhD<br />
Director of Health Services</p>
