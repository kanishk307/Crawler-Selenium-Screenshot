<h4>Message to Students from&#160;NSU President Dr. George Hanbury:</h4>
<p>I hope you and yours are in good health and good spirits. As we all have been navigating through the &#8220;new normal&#8221; for the past few months, I realize that the COVID-19 pandemic has had an impact on your lives.</p>
<p>I want to assure you that we have been working hard making physical changes and implementing recommended protocols by the CDC, state, local, and our own medical and public health experts to welcome you back and provide an environment that will help stop the spread of COVID-19 and allow you to continue your educational journey,&#160; in the safest ways possible.</p>
<p><span>When you arrive on campus, you&#8217;ll see changes that have been made to keep everyone safe as possible &#8211; from increased signage to the addition of more hand-sanitizing stations to the installation of safety plexiglass &#8211; all to keep students, faculty, staff, and visitors safe and healthy.</span></p>
<p>The <a href="/ehs/cv19-resources/student-guide/index.html" originalsrc="https://www.nova.edu/ehs/cv19-resources/student-guide/index.html" shash="t3CK5+sjgYo6UIBt/pbmxR15sP4qgjzoCoivpSoH4bfN36w/Opr50sDwaa13JC5Nx0+J3XAlJ0GadpYmBcHOM9d8WcrTDDmbgNRMBhuNDeplnXyGqhUGwwLc3U/YqwLQXaPO1rS8orSy2JfG8dtWL21FuvNXl6s+DTSIfqTuiQs=">Return of the Sharks website</a> contains detailed information about what we have done, and what we are continuing to do related to COVID-19. &#160;For example, recognizing that you may feel uncomfortable having on-campus classes and now wish to remain online&#8212;we have made preparations so you can do so. The choice is yours, and you can change your method throughout the semester/term so you can continue your education at NSU however you feel safest; that is priority #1.&#160;</p>
<p>Every classroom has been equipped with cameras, microphones, and screens so that NSU&#8217;s faculty may teach both in the classroom and remotely. There may be some exceptions, however, for certain labs or clinical requirements, and you can talk with your academic adviser or program chair to see if these pertain to your educational program. Our goal is to work with you to meet your needs. We understand these are unprecedented times, so we wanted to be as flexible as possible, for you.</p>
<p><strong>Please note that the last day for <em>traditional, in-person undergraduate classes</em> will be Friday, Nov. 20. Those traditional undergraduate courses will conclude in the fall semester fully online. Some undergraduate in-person health care and nursing programs will continue in-person or through hybrid delivery.</strong></p>
<p>While we have made numerous preparations and are taking as many precautions as we can, there is still one thing that is beyond our control&#8212;your role in all of this. <strong>Whether you return to campus, stay online for the fall semester/term, or opt for a hybrid delivery model, you still must do your part and follow all of NSU&#8217;s </strong><a href="/ehs/cv19-resources/index.html" originalsrc="http://www.nova.edu/cv19" shash="sHMpR9EKbyWjf3QoBC32gm68XHsAdndLN9M9gnCPQVtENIbzvwaAiEdDsOXlk18YzKp3ikmN1RjQz0n80RBFHJnaxJGyYIlA95MT+RrAqQFOpyRWfF1B425Xf4LxEkt5LLauc1JBGWNWYYb8hdD1W10QzEZ5/Zqtfw2ySYwSmR0="><strong>Return of the Sharks protocols</strong></a><strong> to help everyone stay healthy. </strong></p>
<p>Remember, continue washing your hands &#8211; for a minimum of 20 seconds &#8211; as often as you can, with soap and water. If you cannot wash your hands, utilize hand sanitizer, either your own or from one of the numerous stations you will find on campus. A face covering will be required at all times while you are on campus or at an NSU location this fall. And, most importantly, if you feel ill, you cannot come to any NSU campus or building &#8212; stay home, or in your resident hall room, and contact the COVID-19 case manager at: <a href="mailto:covidcase@nova.edu">covidcase@nova.edu</a>.</p>
<p>We are in uncharted waters, but the good thing is we&#8217;re all in it together. And together, we&#8217;ll be able to make our way through and, like our mascot the Mako shark, keep swimming forward.</p>
<p>I look forward to seeing you on-campus or online this fall!</p>
<p>&#160;</p>

<h4>Message to Faculty and Staff Members from&#160;NSU President Dr. George Hanbury:</h4>
<p>During most of the spring semester, NSU has weathered an unprecedented crisis, which has required us all too often to exercise creativity, resilience, and versatility. I would like to extend a huge <strong>thank you and an enthusiastic &#8220;Fins Up&#8221; </strong>for all of your hard work to ensure that our students continue to receive a high-quality education, uninterrupted in their journey to thrive and fulfill their academic dreams and aspirations during this ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>To our dedicated and passionate faculty who continued to teach remotely while adhering to NSU&#8217;s Core Values, and to those faculty members who adapted quickly to new learning modalities &#8211; a BIG Thank You! You have excelled and your work has been both encouraging and inspirational. I also wish to commend all our administrative staff&#8212;especially those who needed to remain working on-site&#8212;for the commitment, courage, and strength you have demonstrated over the past months. Because of your efforts, and working as a team, we can truthfully say, &#8220;WE NEVER CLOSED!&#8221;</p>
<p>As to the future, which changes daily, I will keep you informed and continue to keep your health, safety, and well-being a priority as NSU deftly navigates through uncharted and often stressful waters. As such, we will be providing detailed plans and protocols for a phased and thoughtful return to all campuses during the Summer and Fall terms, including but not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li>As stated in previous communications, we will provide in-person, hybrid, and online courses as originally scheduled for the Fall term, in the modality preferred by the student, while adhering to all CDC and local health department guidelines;</li>
<li>To prepare for continued remote classes for fall, we will install multiple cameras and high-tech audio-visual equipment in more than 700 classrooms so that faculty members and students will be able to fully participate in their classes, simultaneously, whether online or face to face.</li>
<li>Faculty members who are assigned to teach in-person classes and staff whose work supports students and is more effectively performed on-site may be asked to return to the workplace for fall terms. However, if a faculty or staff member needs to remain isolated, and is not ill, every effort will be made so that they may be able to perform their duties and responsibilities remotely. Your dean or vice president will be having these discussions with you.</li>
<li>Those employees currently working remotely should continue to do so unless they receive specific direction from their supervisor.</li>
<li>Finally, some students who must meet clinical requirements in their health professional programs and their related faculty and staff members, will begin returning in June and July. They will receive guidance from their dean and professional supervisors this week</li>
</ul>
<p>So, please stay tuned for subsequent updates from me as we formalize the detailed plans and protocols for a phased and thoughtful return to all campuses</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">MAY 1, 2020</span></p>
<h4>Returning to Campus</h4>
<p>I am pleased to inform you that <strong>NSU will open the residence halls and resume in-person classes for the fall 2020 semester/term under our regular schedule at all campuses</strong>, with most programs having either July or August start dates. This, of course, is subject to the Governor of Florida&#8217;s executive orders at the time of opening, as well as CDC and local government directives.</p>
<p>Recommendations and protocols from NSU&#8217;s internationally recognized medical health professionals, along with guidelines from the CDC, state, and local health departments, have <strong>enabled us to be well prepared for your safe return to campus later this summer.</strong>&#160;</p>
<p>Along with helping all NSU students to fulfill their academic dreams and aspirations, your health, well-being, and safety continue to be our top priorities.&#160;NSU&#8217;s core values are foremost as we plan for this return to campus, which focuses on our diverse community of students, faculty and staff, and the provision of the appropriate learning environments that will be key to successful matriculation&#8212;but with careful attention to include special arrangements, choices, and support along the way.</p>
<p>For the fall, our fully online course offerings remain online and our hybrid courses will remain hybrid.<strong> As stated, we are planning to make face-to-face classes and labs available for the fall semester/terms, taking into account proper use of physical distancing, face coverings, and other safety protocols.</strong> However, should public health restrictions or best practices change, or if a student would prefer <em>not</em> to attend a class in person, <strong>the student</strong> <strong>will have a choice to attend this class via synchronous online delivery</strong>. Please note, there may be some clinical programs, studios, experiential courses, clinical hours, or labs where online delivery is not feasible or permissible by accrediting boards, but those will be specific cases.</p>
<p>College deans will be communicating with their students to provide more information and options for each program.</p>
<p>The world is hoping for a cure or vaccine soon to counter this invisible enemy; however, while we hope for the best, we must still make plans for today, and, as such, we are adding more details to our Return to Campus plans and special arrangements each and every day. <strong>As fall start dates draw nearer, we will provide additional updates as you finalize your plans to rejoin us later this summer.</strong></p>
<p>Keep swimming forward as all SHARKS do because that is what NSU continues to do&#8212;and has done for more than 56 years. Fins Up!</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">APRIL 21, 2020</span></p>
<h4>Message from NSU President Dr. George Hanbury:</h4>
<p>As promised, I am continuing to reach out to you with information as decisions are made and developments arise related to the effects COVID-19 has had on NSU and the NSU community. Since I wrote to you last week, we have made some decisions about commencement ceremonies. Also, in addition to the Federal government&#8217;s &#8220;CARES&#8221; stimulus package authorized by Congress and President Trump, we launched the <strong>NSU COVID-19 Student Support Fund</strong> in an effort to provide additional assistance for those students who are in need.&#160; &#160;</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<h5>Commencement</h5>
<p>One of my great joys as your President is to shake your hand as you walk across the Commencement stage.&#160;Unfortunately, that will not be feasible this May or June. Instead, I look forward to experiencing this important milestone with you when we are able to schedule various ceremonies at a later date or, for some of our professional degree recipients, via remote events. Please be assured that your degree will be officially conferred, as usual, based upon your satisfactory completion of all degree requirements, as sanctioned by NSU faculty, and as approved by NSU&#8217;s Board of Trustees.</p>
<p>Even though we always have held commencement ceremonies to publicly witness and celebrate the hard work you perform to achieve your academic goals, our graduates receive their diplomas and degree credentials via FedEx to the address provided on your <a href="/registrar/instructions.html">degree application form</a><span>.</span></p>
<p>As to the commencement ceremonies regularly scheduled for May or June, we are evaluating the best way to hold a live celebration of your academic achievements later this year when it is suitable to have groups assembled. Please stay tuned for updates from your dean.</p>
<p>For those of you receiving professional degrees, your dean will reach out to you with further information as it may be required for you to attend a digital event in order to be given your oath.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<h5>Federal Cares Act and&#160;NSU COVID-19 Student Support Fund</h5>
<p>As I am sure you have seen in the news, the federal government&#8217;s national CARES Act assures that funds will be made available for colleges and universities in order for them to offer some financial support to eligible students who have experienced direct financial or other hardships as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. We were recently informed that NSU will be awarded $3.5 million intended solely for NSU students who are currently enrolled in the winter semester/term and can document financial hardship due to the pandemic. Although we are in receipt of the notification from the federal government, as of today, NSU has not yet received the funds nor have we been given a date when they will be released. We have, however, set up the necessary protocols for the online application, document review, and distribution of these funds once they do arrive.</p>
<p>In addition to the government funding, we created a university-based fund&#8212;the <strong>NSU COVID-19 Student Support Fund&#8212;</strong>that is being contributed to by alumni, faculty, staff, fellow students, past NSU donors and friends. Please watch and share this <a href="https://app.mobilecause.com/f/2qmv/n?vid=78j9p" rel="noopener" target="_blank">video appeal that I made to help those students in need</a>. One hundred percent of these donations will be available, in addition to the Federal CARES Act funds, to provide access to more financial assistance to students who are suffering from COVID-related hardships.&#160;</p>
<p>To apply, and qualify, for federal or NSU COVID-19 Fund financial assistance, eligible students will need to complete an online application form and provide appropriate, supporting documentation to be considered for these funds. In order to ensure regulatory compliance and equity in their distribution, I appointed an NSU Federal CARES Act/COVID-19 Student Support Fund Committee, led by Dr. Stephanie G. Brown, vice president for Enrollment and Student Services. The committee will review the applications to assess eligibility for federal or NSU funds and then determine award amounts to be distributed. &#160;</p>
<p>The committee will be posting additional application details and criteria on the <a href="/financialaid/index.html">ESS financial aid webpage</a> no later than Monday, April 27. While the committee will begin to review applications as they come in, no awards can be distributed until the federal funds are received by the university by the government.</p>
<p>I hope that you remain well and continue to take all necessary precautions as you continue to live, study, and work where you are.</p>
<p>Stay strong, Sharks!</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">APRIL 14, 2020</span></p>
<h4>Message from NSU President Dr. George Hanbury:</h4>
<p><span>I hope this note finds you safe and well as we move into another week under the stay-at-home directives from our governmental and health care leaders.&#160;This incredible transition in a short period of time has, rightfully so, caused many people anxiety, and has produced a lot of questions from students, faculty, and staff members. In my effort to stay in touch with you and respond to you in the timeliest fashion possible, today I have updates to share: 1) grading policy; 2) housing and meal credits and/or refunds; 3) Zoom&#8217;s and NSU&#8217;s security measures necessary to provide privacy protection for students and faculty.</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span><strong>&#160;Grading Policy</strong></span></li>
</ol>
<p><span>In order to respond to this issue correctly, and since NSU has more than 152 academic programs of which 80% are graduate and professional, significant due diligence was undertaken by the Provost and me.&#160; As such, we asked each of the NSU deans to engage in conversations with many of their students, faculty, accreditation agencies, and academic peers to thoroughly explore this issue. We&#8217;ve heard many opinions on all sides of this topic. After careful consideration, our deans agree that we will honor our existing traditional grading system for this semester/term.</span></p>
<p><span>However, all the deans and faculty recognize that one semester/term does not make or unmake a student and his or her overall academic standing. Let me assure you that NSU undergraduates holding NSU scholarships will not be in jeopardy of losing their scholarship based solely on their GPA in this one semester/term. And, as always, assessments of dual admit status toward NSU graduate programs will continue to take into consideration more than one-semester/term variation in a student&#8217;s academic performance. Finally, for those looking forward to NSU&#8217;s other graduate school applications in general, you can expect that all of us will be having to use even greater judgment and discretion in assessing graduate and professional school candidates for next year.</span></p>
<p><span>Any questions should be directed to your department chair or dean.</span></p>
<ol>
<li value="2"><span><strong>&#160;Housing and Meal Credits/Refunds&#160;</strong></span></li>
</ol>
<p><span>Although our residence halls continue to remain open for those who need them, I have authorized Enrollment and Student Services to issue:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Prorated housing <strong>rollover credits, </strong>which will be applied to the next academic year for continuing students (or you can elect to receive a refund); and</span></li>
<li><span>Prorated housing <strong>refunds</strong> for graduating students.</span></li>
<li><span>Students with a remaining balance on their SharkDining accounts will be able to roll over any remaining credit balance to next year or elect to receive a refund.</span></li>
<li><span>Students receiving a residential assistance scholarship for full room and board will not receive a credit or refund since these funds originated from the university.</span></li>
<li><span>Students receiving a university scholarship that included an award toward room and board may not receive a credit or refund since these funds originated from the university.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>Applicable housing credits/refunds will be prorated to coincide with NSU&#8217;s announcement that the remainder of the winter semester would be held fully online.Enrollment and Student Services will begin reaching out to students starting next week outlining the details of their credit or refund. Please allow a few days for these computations to be finalized, but questions can be answered by emailing: <a href="mailto:ESSStudentAccounts@nova.edu">ESSStudentAccounts@nova.edu</a> or by calling (954) 262-5200 or (800) 541-6682, ext. 25200.</span></p>

</ol>
<p><span>In closing, many of you also contacted me last week to inquire about the security of the Zoom platform. I asked our technology officers to reach out to the FBI and the Zoom corporation, and I am confident in the security measures we have in place. Such measures range from a robust encryption system for all Zoom meetings to requiring only authenticated NSU users be permitted to join classroom meetings.

<h4>Message from NSU President Dr. George Hanbury to NSU Faculty and Staff:</h4>
<p>Thank you for everything you do&#8212;from teaching courses, to enrolling new students for the summer and fall, to making sure the enterprise continues to function successfully.</p>
<p>Even though I believe everyone is working hard remotely, we have experienced some &#8220;glitches&#8221; in these first two weeks. I&#8217;ve been hearing from students who are having difficulty transitioning to the online format, and I want to make sure that if you need help reaching your students in this new way of teaching, you know how to access those resources.&#160;</p>
<p>I ask you to extend your compassion in these trying times. Take that extra moment to coach your students who are struggling. Take a moment to reach out to team members who might be dealing with extra stress in their life; then take a moment for yourself.</p>
<p><strong>It is more important than ever for faculty members to be in-tune with your students.</strong></p>
<p>As students learn to &#8220;live their new normal,&#8221; we need to be hyper-focused on organization and flexibility of learning styles. <strong>Our most successful professors have adapted their curricula to meet the needs of our students</strong>&#8212;including recording live classes so that those who are unable to attend in real-time due to schedules for childcare and eldercare, time zone differences, and so many other variables that have been thrust upon us. Helping our students be successful remains our number one priority. Here is some help:&#160;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Please refer to Interim Provost Chenail&#8217;s email from Sunday, April 5, 2020 11:51 a.m. for additional guidance on academic solutions.</strong></li>
<li>Your first point of contact, if you have any questions or concerns, should be your program chair and/or dean.</li>
<li>Engage with the <a href="/lec/index.html">Learning and Education Center</a> where faculty from diverse disciplines can connect and learn from one another, so you can perform at your highest level for your students.</li>
<li>Be kind and mindful that everyone is in a different situation, and know that extending one gesture of kindness to someone might be the touchpoint that turns their day around.&#160;</li>
</ul>
<p>Remember to check <a href="/coronavirus/index.html">NSU&#8217;s COVID-19 webpage</a> for the latest updates, and visit the <a href="/hr/COVID19/index2.html">Office of Human Resources COVID-19 webpage</a> for personnel-related information.&#160;</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t stress enough to please take care of yourself. While we can&#8217;t hold class in-person, go to the gym, or gather with your friends, we can still be well. Here are a few of the many resources available to help us all feel a sense of normalcy in what is most certainly not a normal time.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<h5>Health of the Mind and Body</h5>
<p><strong>Employee Assistance Program&#160;</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The EAP is a confidential, free resource&#160;staffed 24/7 by professional counselors who&#160;can&#160;provide direct support and referral to other support services to&#160;help you deal with situations that seem overwhelming.&#160;The EAP is available to all NSU employees and every member of their household. All NSU employees may access this service &#8211;&#160;you do NOT need to be&#160;enrolled&#160;in the NSU&#160;ICUBA&#160;insurance plan to use this benefit.&#160;You may access services online at&#160;<a href="https://www.resourcesforliving.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">resourcesforliving.com</a> or by phone at 877-398-5816 (press option 1 for EAP services).

<p>While we remain in a remote work situation, I encourage everyone to find ways to exercise and keep yourself active. This can be as simple as taking a walk down the street (keeping six feet distance!) or doing jumping jacks in your living room. There are also many resources available on <a href="/hr/training/index.html">NSU&#8217;s Learning and Organizational Development</a> web page.</p>
<p>Working remotely for the last two weeks, the NSU community has come together in these unprecedented times to continue to deliver on our promise of high-quality education and community service.</p>
<p>Thank you for all that you do, and be well.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><u>APRIL 1, 2020</u></p>
<h4>Message from NSU President Dr. George Hanbury:</h4>
<p>We are living in unprecedented times. I reach out to you today as your president, and as a parent and grandparent. While we limit in-person contact, I&#8217;ve never felt more connected to you. The NSU community continues to demonstrate flexibility, leadership, and capability in providing our students, patients, and families with what you need&#8212;for today and for the future.</p>
<p>Recent projections by state and national health officials make it clear that our preparations to deliver all spring/summer courses fully online were well-measured. We are ready to maintain the continuity of your academic progress in this evolving public health and social environment.</p>
<p><strong>TO THAT END, I AM ANNOUNCING TODAY THAT IN ADDITION TO CURRENTLY RUNNING COURSES, ALL 2020 SPRING AND SUMMER COURSES, WHICH BEGIN BETWEEN MARCH 30 AND MAY 18, WILL BE OFFERED FULLY ONLINE. </strong></p>
<p>COVID-19 is still a fluid situation. As the situation evolves, decisions will be made in consultation with medical experts in the best interest of you, your classmates, and our colleagues.</p>
<p>Should the COVID-19 situation stabilize sooner than expected, the option to participate in face-to-face learning, labs, and clinical activities may become possible again. Specific decisions will be made by, and communicated from, college deans and program heads.</p>
<p><strong>You can feel confident to register for NSU&#8217;s spring and summer courses.</strong></p>
<p>Unique circumstances between colleges and programs&#8212;particularly those involving final years of study and/or licensing, labs, or clinical requirements&#8212;will be taken into consideration. I ask that you work with your program chair or dean to help you navigate those situations.</p>
<p>Finally, I&#8217;ve heard you loud and clear on a number of other topics, such as <strong>commencement</strong>, <strong>pass/fail grading</strong>, and possible <strong>housing and meal plan credits</strong>. I am in continuous contact with NSU&#8217;s deans, faculty members, and students as we weigh the options before us. I expect to provide additional information about these plans in the days ahead.</p>
<p>For now, most NSU faculty and staff members will continue to work remotely to support the normal operations of the university, except for those positions requiring an on-site presence.&#160;</p>
<p>Thank you to our students, faculty and staff members for your commitment, collaboration, and spirit of community. You are doing an amazing job to support each other and ensure that we continue to deliver on our mission. I thank you for that!</p>
<p>After all, we are Sharks. We keep swimming forward and nothing stops us. Fins UP!</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">MARCH 27, 2020</span></p>
<h4>Message from NSU President Dr. George Hanbury:</h4>
<p>Many of you have reached out to me and expressed your concerns about the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as your appreciation for the university&#8217;s response. <em>Your dedication to NSU gives me strength</em>. The incredible collaboration taking place to remain successful is monumental.</p>
<p>I am confident by what I have witnessed in this first week of being fully online, that NSU is well prepared to fulfill our mission. I am encouraged and uplifted daily by stories of innovative teaching and working at NSU&#8212;and I&#8217;ve heard even more enthusiastic stories from our students, who are all online and doing well.</p>
<p>When NSU suspended classes on March 13 to encourage the physical separation between people and eliminate large gatherings, I hoped that we would be able to resume some sense of normalcy after April 17. However, I am informed by Dr. Elaine Wallace&#8212;the head of NSU&#8217;s COVID-19 task force&#8212;and other public health officials, that the requirement for physical separation will remain at least through the remainder of this semester.&#160;</p>
<p>Therefore, I am announcing tonight that <strong>NSU will remain fully online through the remainder of the 2020 &#8220;winter term&#8221; for all undergraduate, graduate, and professional students.</strong>&#160;We will continue to monitor the advice of national and local public health experts to determine if we will transition to residential classes for the summer term, and we will be in touch so you can plan.&#160;</p>
<p>Many decisions remain to be made. As we make those decisions, I will be sure to communicate them with you in a timely manner.&#160;I am currently discussing with university leadership about how to handle our <strong>commencement</strong> ceremonies, <strong>pass/fail grading </strong>options, and all of your most important questions.</p>
<p>I will have more answers for you soon. I know that these topics are important for you and our broader university community. These decisions are not made lightly or without significant thought and study. Please continue to stay connected for further information.&#160;&#160;</p>
<p>Be well, be safe, and keep practicing social distancing (six feet!).&#160;</p>
<p>FINS UP!</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">MARCH 22, 2020</span></p>
<p>On Monday, March 23, NSU resumes all class delivery&#8212;now fully online&#8212;while many of us begin to work remotely. Some of you, whose work functions require it, will continue to work on campus, but there will be fewer people around. Welcome to our &#8220;new normal,&#8221; for now.</p>
<p>As we transition to learning, teaching, and conducting our daily business fully online, I again want to say <strong>thank you </strong>for your ongoing patience and dedication. NSU was in the vanguard of distance and online learning, and we are prepared to meet our students&#8217; needs today as we have in the past.</p>
<p>Many are saying that we are in an &#8220;era of uncertainty.&#8221; <strong>I assure you today, as your president, that I am confident we will continue to swim forward&#8212;like a shark&#8212;and be stronger than ever.</strong></p>
<p>I enjoy interacting with you in person, and in the spirit of social distancing, I put together a short video message for you.</p>
<center><iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" height="225" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/x62Ouv7lyTk" width="400"></iframe></center>
<p>Please continue to find operational updates on the university&#8217;s <a href="/coronavirus/index.html">COVID-19 information page</a>. As always, the best resource for your questions and concerns are your deans, vice presidents, and supervisors. Also, employees can find important updates from the <a href="/hr/COVID19/index2.html">Office of Human Resources here</a>.</p>
<p>And for when your students have questions, Dr. Brad Williams compiled a <a href="/prmc/communications/images/student-service-letter.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><strong>resource guide for students</strong></a> to help them continue to receive support and be academically successful. It&#8217;s essential to me that you can all receive the support you need to keep NSU fully operational and able to serve our students, patients, and extended community.</p>
<p>Whether you are in your office or working remotely come Monday&#8212;based on direction from your supervisor&#8212;I am sending you a big FINS UP as we go fully online tomorrow. Together, we are ONE NSU.&#160;</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">MARCH 20, 2020</span></p>
<h4>Message from NSU President Dr. George Hanbury:</h4>
<p><span>I want to start by thanking you, the NSU community, for your dedication and all of your efforts to rise to the challenges we are facing today with the COVID-19 pandemic. </span></p>
<p><span>The health, safety, and well-being of our NSU community remains my highest priority. The current situation, particularly in Broward County, is rapidly evolving. We continue to closely monitor and incorporate guidance from the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and our own Pan-NSU Coronavirus Task Force, led by the dean of the Dr. Kiran C. Patel College of Osteopathic Medicine, Dr. Elaine Wallace. </span></p>
<p><span>It&#8217;s essential that NSU remains operational so that we may continue to fulfill our mission for our students, patients, alumni, and extended community. In preparation to resume all classes&#8212;fully online&#8212;on Monday, March 23, our faculty remain laser-focused on meeting our students&#8217; needs via video instruction, live chats, teleconferences, and other digital connections, all in accordance with CDC guidelines. Our recruiters and admissions staff continue to shape next year&#8217;s academic class, and our coaches are creating innovative training and conditioning regimens for our student-athletes.</span></p>
<p><span>Student support services (including admissions, registration, financial aid, and academic advising), as well as human resources, OIIT, and all other administrative services will remain fully operational during the COVID-19 disruption. Please refer to the </span><a href="/hr/COVID19/index2.html" originalsrc="https://www.nova.edu/hr/COVID19/index2.html" shash="oLkt5xTpEJqZ9rFeXb7BLHYWSRyFReEx2lgimDrovToMfuB5k4eRBpM7SEdiVX9Uvbx7JKOZvzaOtGS7Od4FR+xTVgM1MPgpxkxiMwENSWSJnIz+/0n+cO156hOSq83IbW/a40wymrwO+D7UEB9hQSqHpuxmJD8uu3mt8o4LIbw=" title="Office of Human Resources COVID-19 web page"><span>Office of Human Resources COVID-19 web page</span></a><span>for important details.</span></p>
<p><span>For the last several days, we have tested our capabilities to deliver our curricula and university business in a remote working environment, and we have been very successful. <strong>Therefore, beginning at 5:00 p.m. today, I am authorizing a broader application of our enhanced Telework Policy</strong> so that all faculty and staff&#8212;other than clinical or critical personnel for the operations of the university&#8212;shall perform their duties remotely in the days to come. As such, emergency clinical and critical on-site operations for the continued operation of the university will remain in place.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Some employees whose work functions require it and are critical to the operations of the university, will continue to work on campus or in their offices, as assigned by their supervisor.

<p>&#160;</p>
<h4>Operational Updates</h4>
<p>As NSU adapts to today&#8217;s ever-changing conditions, here are some operational updates to help you understand how various university units are managing their policies and practices to ensure that we can all remain fully operational while best ensuring the safety, health and wellbeing of our people and our institution.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Direct Deposit is strongly recommended.</strong> All employees are encouraged to participate in the electronic direct deposit program for their payroll and employee reimbursements. Should there be any disruptions in mail or other services as a result of developments surrounding COVID-19, direct deposit will ensure a reliable method to receive payroll payments. Any employees who are currently receiving a paper paycheck (employees who are NOT already signed up for direct deposit), can access the following link to <a href="/payroll/index.html">sign up for this free service on the Payroll web page</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Business Services and Accounts Payable</strong> will be working with active vendors who have not submitted the necessary documentation to receive payments via ACH, and are currently being paid through paper check, to encourage their participation in the ACH process. For those employees who are involved in submitting vendor payment requests/manage vendor relationships, please work with your vendors accordingly to ensure they submit the necessary information to Accounts Payable. The Vendor Direct Deposit Form is accessible at <a href="/accounts-payable/forms/index.html">https://www.nova.edu/accounts-payable/forms/index.html.</a></li>
<li><strong>Facilities and housekeeping</strong> reassures everyone that special crews and additional staff are continuing to keep campus facilities clean and maintained per CDC and other public health guidelines. While main campus buildings are currently open, with classes suspended and resuming online only on Monday, there may be some classrooms that are locked after cleaning to allow cleaning crews to focus their efforts only on in-use spaces and common areas. Cleaning staff are provided with extra training and protective gear as needed, given their particular assignments.</li>
<li><strong>OIIT</strong> reminds NSU employees to only open and use our VPN connections when it is essential for your current work transaction. Please do not leave VPN open if you are not actively using it. Zoom is the preferred meeting platform for NSU but remember that you can also use the NSU conference call platform when that type of connection will suffice. A <strong>hot line for technical questions is 954-262-0070</strong> and additional tech staff have been assigned to serve your needs.&#160;</li>
<li><strong>Regional Campus locations</strong> remain fully operational, but with all classes resuming fully online on Monday, these locations are no longer accessible to walk-ins. Regional campus staff are working remotely and remain connected with current and prospective students through phone, digital meeting platforms, email and web. Please go to <a href="/campuses/index.html" title="nova.edu/campuses">nova.edu/campuses</a> to check for contact info.</li>
<li><strong>NSU Libraries</strong>, including the Alvin Sherman Library and all other locations, are fully operational online to support students, faculty and library users. Administrative staff are working remotely or on site only as needed. Most of the libraries&#8217; extensive collection has been online for more than 10 years and we&#8217;ve provided library services to distance and regional campus students for more than 25 years. For current information, see&#160;<a href="http://lib.nova.edu/virtual" originalsrc="http://lib.nova.edu/virtual" rel="noopener" shash="BApi8V5HYeaZWXaqHk3ekzPn8i8H3bOXR3tU9Z64I6RWXIHH1CggStKS2NRLggZiu8WT5mLgBzfbPXw6Z7WGgeT1SewJ6qXvhJBGWrlRYheNn4D9Gzzf51r0GSPxtORZPT9UJqVaW3PYBmn7cU1IKJroIRPcmydVe6v4bBRPtFA=" target="_blank">http://lib.nova.edu/virtual</a>.</li>
<li><strong>NSU Clinics and Pharmacy</strong> are open in a limited capacity and with a focus on maintaining essential continuity of care and providing emergency services. Clinic cleaning and protection protocols are all in full accordance with CDC guidelines to protect clinical staff and patients. Administrators are working remotely with some rotations accessing clinic offices when work functions require on-site activities. Clinics are expected to add telehealth services in the coming days. Please call your clinic office or check their website for details.</li>
<li>All <strong>Human Resource</strong> functions are fully operational to provide employees with uninterrupted payroll, benefits and other workplace support services. Be sure to check regularly at the special <a href="/hr/COVID19/index2.html" title="OHR COVID-19 web page">OHR COVID-19 web page</a> on the Human Resource site for updated details, tips, resources and FAQs.</li>
<li><strong>NSU Business Services and Mailroom</strong> continue to operate to ensure that you will receive mail and deliveries, as well as meeting special supply needs for researchers, health care operations and providing meal deliveries to any students who remain in residence halls. All other food or regular dining outlets on campus are suspended at this time.</li>
<li><strong>NSU Research operations</strong>, including the Center for Collaborative Research (CCR), the Ocean Campus and our many research centers and projects, remain fully operational including maintaining essential on-campus or location-specific facilities and providing access and support for all active researchers and projects to ensure research integrity and continuity.</li>
<li><strong>The NSU Museum of Art</strong> closed to the public Wednesday, March 18, but remains fully operational with employees working on site as needed or remotely. Please check out the <a href="https://nsuartmuseum.org/exhibitions/currently-on-view/" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="virtual exhibit link">virtual exhibit link</a> or visit the webpage at <a href="https://nsuartmuseum.org/" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="nsuartmuseum.org">nsuartmuseum.org</a></li>
<li>As a reminder, <strong>all NSU-related travel is suspended.</strong> If you believe pending travel is &#8220;essential,&#8221; please seek approval first from your dean or vice president. They can then submit the request to Dr. Ron Chenail (deans) or Dr. Harry Moon (vice presidents) for approval before any travel funds or expenses will be authorized to be issued or reimbursed.</li>
</ul>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">MARCH 17, 2020</span></p>
<p><span>The continued spread of COVID-19 requires Nova Southeastern University to be pragmatic, act quickly, and take proactive steps to ensure our shared safety and the safety of the community at large. To that end, NSU will be making adjustments to its clinical operations.</span><span></span><span>&#160;</span><span></span></p>
<p><span>NSU will close the following clinical locations as of</span><span>&#160;</span><span><strong>noon on Tuesday, March 17, 2020</strong></span><span>, for the next two weeks:</span></p>

<h4>Message from NSU President Dr. George Hanbury:</h4>
<p>As I promised in my previous communication to you on Thursday night, I want to keep you up-to-date on the rapidly evolving coronavirus pandemic. Here are the latest updates:</p>
<ul>
<li>Today, the university learned, and the Broward County Health Department has confirmed, that there is a total of six positive COVID-19 cases involving individuals with an NSU affiliation, all of whom had traveled internationally to Ireland prior to travel restrictions for Europe and the U.K. (Ireland and the U.K. were only added to the U.S. travel ban as of today).</li>
<li>At this time, to our knowledge, no other NSU student, faculty or staff member has tested positive for COVID-19.</li>
<li>NSU&#8217;s medical and health care experts, under the guidelines established by the Broward County Health Department, interviewed the Study Abroad students and have counseled these travelers, as well as any students, faculty or staff members believed to have been in close contact with them, to self-isolate, and NSU has provided many services to support them.</li>
<li>NSU suspended all classes on Thursday, March 12, at 11:59 p.m. Classes will resume on Monday, March 23, with fully online delivery.</li>
<li>Residential Life and Housing is assisting students to leave all residence halls, transitioning to their homes or off-campus housing by no later than 5:00 p.m. on Sunday, March 15.</li>
<li>The university is working with all individuals who are not able to travel home to ensure that that they have a housing option.</li>
<li>We continue enhanced cleaning measures that were put in place more than a month ago for all residence halls and throughout the university&#8217;s public spaces.</li>
<li>The NSU community has been provided with posted reminders from the CDC on how to conduct ourselves in the safest and most hygienic manner possible. For a reminder, visit: <a href="/coronavirus/prevention.html">https://www.nova.edu/coronavirus/prevention.html</a></li>
<li>As of Friday, March 13, NSU University School and the Mailman Segal Center suspended all in-person classes for students in their early childhood and Junior Kindergarten through Grade 12 programs until April 13.</li>
<li>The university remains open and operational with appropriate measures in place to protect the health, safety, and welfare of the community.</li>
<li>All employees and staff should maintain regular work schedules as directed by their supervisors. The Office of Human Resources will issue a follow-up email later today to all employees that will provide further guidance, including answers to frequently asked questions.&#160;</li>
</ul>
<p>NSU is taking decisive and informed action to respond to concerns about the coronavirus while ensuring the continuity of our academic and institutional mission. As such, today&#8217;s updates might not be tomorrow&#8217;s answers, but we continue to monitor and adapt to the ever-changing situation. I will keep you posted.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">MARCH 13, 2020</span></p>
<h4><strong><span color="red" style="color: red;">Effective as of 11:59 p.m., March 12, 2020, all university classes are suspended until Monday, March 23, 2020.</span></strong>&#160;</h4>

As more information is available, we will communicate further with our families.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Housing, Events, and Campus Life</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>NSU is taking decisive and informed action to respond to concerns about the coronavirus while ensuring the continuity of our academic and institutional mission. The university remains open and operational with appropriate measures to protect the health of the community.</li>
<li>As such, to minimize social contact, residential students are strongly encouraged to depart their residence halls by Sunday, March 15, 2020.</li>
<li>All residential students should coordinate with the Office of Residential Life and Housing regardless of whether they choose to stay or leave by registering here: <a href="https://opinio.nova.edu:443/opinio/s?s=18617">https://opinio.nova.edu:443/opinio/s?s=18617</a>. We will communicate further information as it becomes available.</li>
<li>The University is following all guidelines, including those from the CDC, the Florida Department of Health, and the Broward County Health Department&#8217;s broader set of recommendations, which may include self-isolation for students in some circumstances.</li>
<li>All Athletic events are suspended until further notice, pursuant to direction from the NCAA&#8217;s Board of Governors.</li>
<li>There will be no events or gatherings of more than 50 people at any university locations through at least April 17, in response to federal and state guidelines as well as Broward County&#8217;s recently issued state of emergency.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Travel</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>As of today, all NSU-related travel outside of the continental U.S. is suspended.</li>
<li>As a reminder, all non-essential NSU travel has also been suspended within the continental United States, as determined by your Dean or Vice President, and approved by the Provost.</li>
<li>If you are currently traveling internationally and return with symptoms, we recommend that you self-isolate for 14 days and consult with a medical professional.</li>
<li>If you are currently traveling internationally and return without symptoms, we recommend that you self-isolate for 3 days and consult with a medical professional if symptoms arise.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Campus and Off-Site Operations</strong></h4>
<p>NSU wants to support its employees in making the best choices for themselves, their families and the University community in response to COVID-19 disruptions.&#160;</p>
<ul>
<li>At this time, the university remains open. Employees should maintain their regular schedules unless otherwise informed by their supervisor.</li>
<li>All of our clinical health centers remain open at this time.</li>
<li>NSU Art Museum Fort Lauderdale will remain open. All events or groups scheduled through April 17 with more than 50 people will be postponed or canceled. Please consult the museum's website <a href="http://www.nsuartmuseum.org">nsuartmuseum.org</a> for updates.</li>
<li>NSU Libraries will remain open, but all library events will be suspended until April 17.</li>
<li>Employees should not feel compelled to come to work while ill because they have no available paid sick leave and may lose pay. Please review the email sent by the Office of Human Resources to all employees on 3/12/2020 for more details.</li>
</ul>
<p>The safety and security of our NSU community is the most important thing, and so it is out of an abundance of caution that we are&#160;taking these steps. All of these precautions are based on the recommendations of NSU&#8217;s world-class health care experts and operational teams who are leading NSU&#8217;s COVID-19 preparedness committee.</p>
<p>Please monitor your email and the special <a href="/coronavirus/index.html">information page on the NSU website</a> dedicated to COVID-19 information for updates.</p>
<p>Thank you for your cooperation in making this transition to keep our community safe and healthy. Remember to wash your hands frequently and cover your coughs and sneezes. NSU will send further&#160;communication on COVID-19 as there is new information.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>Previously Shared Information Below</strong></em></h4>
<h4>Health Clinics</h4>
<ul>
<li>All of our clinical health centers remain open at this time. Triage is occurring prior to entry into our clinics to minimize patients with COVID-19 symptoms co-mingling with other patients.</li>
<li>We are not aware of any clinic patients who have been diagnosed with COVID-19.</li>
<li>No clinical location on campus is providing COVID-19 testing at this time.</li>
<li>If it is deemed necessary, you will be referred to the closest testing center.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Facilities</h4>
<ul>
<li>NSU&#8217;s campuses are clean and safe. The Office of Facilities Management and our janitorial partner, ABM, are taking extra measures to ensure the university&#8217;s campuses are clean and safe.</li>
<li>High-touch surfaces like doorknobs, door touch plates, door handles, the top of chair backs and armrests, table tops, faucets and light switches are cleaned with a medical grade disinfectant at least once a day.</li>
<li>Extra hand sanitizer dispensers have been added to the campus</li>
<li>CDC health care/viral protection posters have been placed around campus.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Faculty, Administrators, and Staff</h4>
<ul>
<li>NSU wants to support its employees in making the best choices for themselves, their families and the University community in response to COVID-19 disruptions. Employees should not feel compelled to come to work while ill because they have no available paid sick leave and may lose pay.</li>
<li>Additional information on operationalizing sick leave will be communicated shortly to the all employees, the President&#8217;s Council, and the university&#8217;s HR Contacts.</li>
<li>If you are feeling any symptoms of illness that would require you to miss work, please contact your supervisor or HR contact. Do not come to work if you are ill.</li>
<li>All NSU staff should obtain training on the&#160;<a href="/oiit/news/zoom.html">Zoom videoconferencing platform</a> (see email from OIIT dated Feb. 14, 2020). Zoom is an excellent way to conduct meetings remotely.</li>
</ul>
<h5>Shark Preview Weekend (Future Students)</h5>
<p>NSU&#8217;s&#160;<strong>Shark Preview Weekend for March 12-14, 2020</strong>&#160;<strong>will continue as planned.&#160;</strong>Although there are no known cases of the virus among the NSU community as of March 11, 2020, NSU places the highest priority on the health and safety of its students, faculty, staff and campus visitors. We want to ensure our future and current Sharks remain safe and healthy during this time.</p>
<p><strong><u>Out of State Students Who Requested Housing</u></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Due to the developments surrounding the novel coronavirus (COVID-19), students who are not traveling alone to Shark Preview Weekend, meaning they are traveling to campus with their families, must stay with their families in their lodging accommodations rather than staying overnight with our student hosts on campus.</li>
<li>Students traveling to campus alone will still receive airport transportation and housing accommodations.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><u>Tri-County Students Who Requested Housing</u></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Due to the developments surrounding the novel coronavirus (COVID-19), we cannot provide the overnight experience in our residence halls for local students.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Be Prepared</h4>
<p>In order to assure continued safety within our community, we ask the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>All members of the NSU community should register for &#8220;NSU alerts.&#8221; Registration can be found at&#160;<a href="/emergency/notification/registration-process.html">https://www.nova.edu/emergency/notification/registration-process.html</a>.</li>
<li>Do not travel to Level 3 countries (as of now, China, Iran, Italy, South Korea)</li>
<li>If you have been in close contact with anyone who has traveled to a Level 3 country, please identify yourself to your supervisor; you may be asked to self-quarantine.</li>
<li>Be familiar with all items on NSU&#8217;s dedicated&#160;<a href="/coronavirus/index.html">COVID-19 web page</a>.</li>
<li>Read all updated emails from the university thoroughly.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Stay Healthy</h4>
<ul>
<li>If you are symptomatic, your doctor will determine if you have signs and symptoms of COVID-19 and whether you should be tested.</li>
<li>Do not go to an NSU clinic as we are not testing on-site at this time.</li>
<li>Wash your hands with soap and water for 20-seconds or more and do this regularly and frequently. Use hand sanitizer (60% alcohol) if you cannot access soap and water.</li>
<li>Cover your nose and mouth when coughing or sneezing in the bend of your elbow or into a tissue (and throw the tissue away).</li>
<li>Regularly disinfect commonly touched surfaces or items with a cleanser that is at least 60% alcohol.</li>
</ul>
<p>Remember that you are part of a community that is being proactive and is&#160;<u>actively engaged</u>&#160;in preparedness.&#160; Refer any questions or concerns to your respective deans or unit administrators.&#160; They have all been advised of proper channels of collective communication.</p>            </div></div><!-- content-block -->
