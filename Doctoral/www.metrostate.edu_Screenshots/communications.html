            <p>Dear Faculty and Staff, </p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon Chancellor Malhotra asked all Minnesota State College &amp; University presidents to create alternatives to our current service delivery. Campuses were asked to allow for alternative work schedules for employees, including remote work where it is feasible. Employees, for instance, who have underlying conditions will be accommodated, and we may staff that functionality in an alternative manner. The Chancellor has also asked all campuses to keep libraries and essential services operational. Plans are underway to provide all student support services in a remote manner for the rest of the semester. </p>

<p>This situation is changing daily, so please continue to read emails thoroughly. The Metro Pandemic Planning and Response Team met this morning and we would like to clarify the Chancellor’s memo and what this means for Metropolitan State University employees: </p>
<ul><li>Metropolitan State University’s goal is to have as many employees work remotely as possible. There <strong>will </strong>need to be some individuals on campus. We will distribute the on-campus work so it will not fall to a small group of individuals. </li>
<li>We are working to solidify open building hours so faculty and staff can access offices. You will receive a message about building hours and services at our locations soon. </li>
<li>Work with your supervisor to schedule needed hours on campus. </li>
<li>If you have concerns about not having enough work to do at home for 40 hours a week, please contact your supervisor. Human Resources and the President’s Executive Cabinet is working on a list of projects from other departments that can be done remotely. </li>
<li>Employee work schedules and assigned duties will continue to change over the next few weeks. </li>
<li>Governor Waltz signed a new <a href="https://mn.gov/governor/assets/EO%2020-07_tcm1055-423539.pdf" target="_blank">Executive Order</a> (PDF) that suspends, for the duration of the peacetime emergency, provisions of public employees’ collective bargaining agreements regarding work schedules, work locations, assignments, and reassignments. </li>
</ul><p><strong>Remote working:</strong> </p>
<ul><li>Yesterday, the Metro Pandemic Planning and Response Team, completed the review of all requests for laptops and software needs to enable employees to work remotely. We are able to fulfill all the requests we received. ITS is re-imaging the devices now and installing needed software. <strong><em>Individuals who have been approved for laptop distribution will be notified when a laptop is ready for them directly by ITS. Please do not call ITS with inquiries. </em></strong>We expect all laptops to be distributed by the end of the day on Friday, March 20. </li>
<li>In some cases, employees working from home will have to use their own equipment. This allows us to stretch our available resources further and support more remote working arrangements. Please do not take office desktops or monitors home. </li>
<li>Remote working or working from home, usually requires a telework agreement. Given the urgency of allowing as many people as possible to work from home, we are not requiring a written telework agreement. However, supervisors will be in contact with each employee who is working remotely over the next week, to review the requirements of work from home and will need an email acknowledgment from each employee that the supervisor has reviewed the requirements with them and that they understand their obligations. <strong><em>Please note that telework does not apply to instructional faculty (IFO).</em></strong> </li>
</ul><p><strong>Additional notes:</strong> </p>
<ul><li>In-person meetings of fewer than ten individuals are permitted through March 31 unless otherwise noted. However, I encourage the use of Zoom for all meetings.</li>
<li>The Fitness Center will be closed starting March 19 until further notice. </li>
</ul><p><strong>Our priorities are the following:</strong> </p>
<ul><li>To safeguard the health, safety and welfare of our faculty, staff and students </li>
<li>To enable students to complete the spring semester and progress toward their educational goals </li>
</ul><p>
Thank you for your continued dedication and commitment to our students and university. We are strong and we will succeed! </p>

<p>Please take care of yourself and your loved ones.... </p>

<p>Ginny</p>

            <p><a>Dear Students, </a></p>
<p>I am writing to provide an update to you on the planning work that is occurring during our current suspension. <strong>All instruction at Metropolitan State University is suspended until March 30, 2020</strong>. When classes resume, <strong>all instruction will occur remotely for the rest of the semester</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Planning for Classes to Resume</strong></p>
<p>The faculty are using this suspension to modify their courses in two ways: 1) to resume using remote instruction, and 2) to accommodate a shorter semester and complete as planned on May 4, 2020. I’ve asked faculty to communicate with you by the end of Friday, March 20 providing a list of the technology tools that you will need to be able to use to successfully complete each of your classes. Training materials and sessions will be available next week for the different technology tools. More information will be provided to you by Friday, March 20.</p>

<p><strong>Supporting You</strong></p>
<p>Student support areas are also engaged in planning activities this week. We are working to have academic advising, tutoring, counseling, other student support services, and accessibility meetings available remotely by the end of the week. Each of the four main campus locations (St. Paul, LECJEC, MEC, and Midway) will be open for students to access computer and internet, until we are told to do otherwise. The Food for Thought Food Shelf will remain open and we are looking at remote distribution options. We are also gathering information about community-based resources that will support our students. More information will be provided by email and on the COVID-19 page (<a href="https://www.metrostate.edu/notices/covid-19">https://www.metrostate.edu/notices/covid-19</a>) once planning is completed.</p>

<p>As you know from reading your email and through the news, this is very quickly evolving situation. We will continue to update you as more information is available. Our goal with these communications is to help alleviate your concerns about being able to successfully complete your semester. Please know that all the faculty and staff are working very hard, on your behalf, to ensure a high-quality learning experience, even if it is very different from the experience we all originally planned. I also want to assure you that this does not represent a long-term change towards an online university. We are adapting at this time to the on-going pandemic.</p>

<p>Please also take good care of yourselves in this very stressful time. Below are a number of mental heath resources that you might find helpful.</p>

            <p>Dear Colleagues,</p>
<p>Thank you for your patience as we navigate how to maintain the most positive student and community experiences during the COVID-19 pandemic. While our attention has been on addressing the most immediate issues related to preparing for alternative instruction, alternative delivery of student services and protection of our employees’ physical and financial health, we are now examining the impact of COVID-19 on events.</p>
<p>On Saturday, March 14, the Center for Disease Control guidance that any gatherings or events should be limited to no more than 50 people to ensure public health and safety. Metropolitan State University takes this guidance and the social distancing requirement very seriously. </p>
<p>We also understand the important role that our commencement ceremony plays in marking our students’ successful journey to a degree. Thus, it is with deep regret that the University has postponed the Spring Commencement from April 26, 2020 to August 15, 2020 at the Minneapolis Convention Center. The Outstanding Student Reception, planned for Saturday April 4, 2020 is also being postponed.</p>
<p>Students who were planning to participate in one of the April ceremonies are being notified by Student Life and Leadership Development staff, who will be assisting them with the logistics of this change in date. Students who are registered for Spring Commencement will not need to take any actions to RSVP. The change in date will allow us to accommodate summer graduates who may wish to participate in August rather than December. Those details will be worked out over the next couple of weeks.</p>
<p>We will find ways to virtually congratulate our spring 2020 graduates at the end of the semester.</p>

            <p>Colleagues,</p>
<p>These unprecedented times require us to think differently about the work that we do and the services that we offer. Many aspects of this issue continue to evolve and create a fluid and challenging situation. Know that the feedback we are hearing from you, students, and the campus leadership are being taken into consideration as we identify the work ahead and make the necessary adjustments.</p>
<p>Regardless of the changing circumstances, our priorities will always remain the same:</p>
<ul><li><strong>To safeguard the health, safety, and welfare of our faculty, staff, and students</strong></li>
<li><strong>To enable students to complete the spring semester and progress toward their educational goals</strong></li>
</ul><p>To that end, it is critical that during this time of great uncertainty that we enhance all communication channels and work together on the above mentioned priorities. I also ask for your patience during this time. The information set is changing at a pace that we have not experienced before. Just this afternoon, CDC issued the recommendation that for the next 8 weeks, organizers cancel or postpone in-person events that consist of 50 people or more throughout the United States.</p>
<p>I wanted to share with you steps we are taking to adjust to this rapidly changing environment.</p>
<p><strong>Academic Continuity of Operations</strong><br />
The portfolio of academic offerings our 37 colleges and universities provide is diverse not only in their focus but also in the instructional methodologies used. In light of the concerns that we have heard from campuses, <strong>we will extend the preparation time for faculty and staff by one additional week</strong>. Instruction will resume on March 30. For the five colleges currently on spring break this week, they will also receive additional time and will resume instruction for students on April 6.</p>
<p><strong>Staffing Continuity of Operations</strong><br />
As we continue our work towards helping our students finish the semester, we must stay focused on their health and safety and that of our faculty and staff. It is important that maximum flexibility is required of both employees and supervisors. We must look at how we can do our work differently and provide services for students while also supporting our colleagues and partners. Be cognizant of the following parameters as you work with your teams to accomplish the needed work:</p>
<ul><li>For the duration of this outbreak, all campuses are expected to be mindful of faculty and staff health and safety needs, and make accommodations for those individuals with underlying medical conditions that may make them more vulnerable to COVID-19, as well as those who may live with and/or care for such individuals, or those with children home from school. Similarly, there will likely be some faculty and staff without these conditions who are for other reasons anxious about returning to the workplace and interacting with others, particularly those who may have recently traveled. Campuses are expected to make every effort to accommodate employees and allow them to work from home whenever feasible.</li>
</ul><ul><li>For employees whose job responsibilities do not lend themselves to telework, options include adjusting work schedules or staggering shifts, where appropriate, to increase social distancing. </li>
</ul><ul><li>Where possible, phone or video conferencing should be used to limit the size of meetings and to continue to engage those faculty or staff who may have alternative work options in place to remain engaged.</li>
</ul><ul><li>We can predict increased employee absences due to an individual illness, to care for family members, or respond to the temporary closure of K-12 schools. We need to plan ahead, cross-train to cover essential tasks and work through your continuity of operations plan.</li>
</ul><p>The State provides confidential counseling resources to employees who are struggling with life matters that impact their personal well-being. Employees who are experiencing significant stress related to this matter may choose to utilize these resources. More information is available here: <a href="https://mn.gov/mmb/segip/health-and-wellbeing/eap/eap-work-life.jsp" target="_blank">https://mn.gov/mmb/segip/health-and-wellbeing/eap/eap-work-life.jsp</a></p>
<p>Additional resources and guidance for state employees for travel and the necessary precautions after returning from travel out of the state or the country can be found on the <strong>Minnesota Management and Budget (MMB) BeReadyMN</strong> website here: <a href="https://mn.gov/mmb/be-ready-mn/infectious-diseases/covid-19.jsp" target="_blank">https://mn.gov/mmb/be-ready-mn/infectious-diseases/covid-19.jsp</a></p>
<p>If you have questions regarding exposure as a result of travel, Minnesota Department of Health asks you to call 651-201-5414 or 877-676-5414 for guidance.</p>
<p>I deeply appreciate what you all do to support our students and colleges and universities each and every day. It is your creativity, passion, commitment, and energy which will enable us to overcome these challenges and provide the needed resiliency to successfully navigate our campuses through these difficult times.</p>
<p>Best,<br />

            <p>To our campus community—faculty, staff and students:</p>
<p>The COVID-19 pandemic situation continues to evolve rapidly. Over the last two days new information and actions by the State and Federal government have emerged. Thus, I am updating information previously provided regarding actions to be taken if you have traveled at all over Spring Break.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) updated their Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) Travel Information to designate most countries in Europe, along with China, Iran, and South Korea at Level 3 (Warning, Avoid Nonessential Travel). Given that President Trump has now also issued an order restricting travel from the United Kingdom and Republic of Ireland, beginning at 11:59 pm on Monday, March 16, we expect that the UK and Ireland will be added to the Level 3 list by Tuesday.</p>
<p>Every other part of the world, including the United States, has now been designated at Level 2 (Practice Enhanced Precautions) as a Global Outbreak Notice.</p>
<p>These designations have implications for actions to be taken to maintain health and safety for you and others during this pandemic.</p>
<p><strong>Travel Guidance Effective immediately</strong><br /><strong>Faculty, Staff, and Students Returning from a Level 3 Country – Self Quarantine</strong></p>
<p>All travelers who are returning from a Level 3 country must stay home in a self-quarantine for 14 days after returning from travel, monitor their health, and practice social distancing. Social distancing means staying out of crowded places, avoiding group gatherings, and maintaining distance (approximately 6 feet or 2 meters) from others when possible.

            <p>Dear Resident Faculty Colleagues,</p>

<p>I’ve received a number of questions about my message indicating that faculty to should report to their primary campus location on Monday, March 16. Please allow me to provide some additional context and clarify the expectation.</p>

<p>In the context of making concrete plans for <em>moving all our courses</em><em> to some sort of remote instruction</em> (with the exceptions outlined in my email "Pandemic Planning for Faculty" sent on Friday, 3/13/20 at 3:05 p.m.), it is imperative that we work together, as departments, to make shared decisions about the curriculum and methods of remote instruction for the remainder of the semester. Resident faculty engagement will be critical the success of those plans and for engaging community faculty. I also know that many faculty members have ideas and expertise that will support their whole department in this important work ensuring that our students have a quality learning experience when all instruction is delivered remotely. The involvement of all faculty members is important and expected.</p>

<p>Meeting and making shared decisions on Monday 3/16/20 allows for coherent movement forward. Of course, "reporting to work" can be done remotely! Several people contacted me individually about reporting to work remotely based on underlying health concerns and/or belonging to a particularly high-risk group. Faculty with these concerns should follow up with their dean and department chair. Faculty members who are not feeling well should not come to campus and find a way to participate remotely. Finally, I ask that anyone who has recently travel to a high-risk area of the country or to any international location self-quarantine for two weeks and not come to campus during that time frame.</p>

<p>For those who are able to meet in person, we are encouraging everyone across campuses to increase social distancing at work. Any meetings that take place in person should occur in a room large enough to allow significant spacing. Let me reassure you that our campus cleaning personnel, at all locations, are diligently cleaning surfaces frequently and our administrative staff is working hard to help all of us in working out a feasible plan for our students to complete this semester. You should also find sanitizing wipes in the classrooms.</p>

<p>The university is following guidelines from the system and the MN Department of Health, which do not suggest that we close our campuses. Until we are told otherwise, faculty, staff, administrator, and some students will be onsite at our campus locations. We are looking for ways to support students who have computer and internet needs at each location.</p>

<p>Though we are still on spring break today (Saturday, 3/14/20), I understand that some deans and department chairs have already reached out with plans for meetings times and remote (Zoom) participation for those who choose that venue. Please watch for more information from your dean and/or your department chairs.</p>

<p>Best regards,<br />
Amy</p>

            <p><a>Dear Students, </a></p>
<p>The COVID-19 pandemic is having widespread impacts. MN State Colleges and Universities leadership has been in close communication with the MN Department of Health and state leaders in responding to the evolving situation. The Chancellor has made a number of decisions at the system level that are designed to minimize or slow the spread of the virus with the goal of supporting the health and well-being of our faculty, staff, and students. Of course, there is a great deal of uncertainty about how the illness will unfold in our community and it is very stressful time for all of us. Please know that the Pandemic Planning Team is carefully monitoring the recommendations of health professionals, and the decisions made by the system. We will be providing regular updates by email and on the website.</p>
<p>It is critically important that you take care of your health and do not come to campus if you are ill. We are monitoring the health of our community and would appreciate it if you would report any COVID-19 exposure, symptoms, or diagnosis using this web form (<a href="https://www.metrostate.edu/COVID">https://www.metrostate.edu/COVID</a>). Reporting via the form is voluntary. However, if you are ill please notify your faculty instructors.</p>
<p>This is going to be a long email with a number of details that are important for you. I’ve organized the information under headings to make it easier to navigate. Please read to the end to ensure that you have full information.</p>
<p><strong>Suspension of Course Instruction through Saturday, March 21 and Resumption of Instruction</strong></p>
<p>Chancellor Malhotra has suspended all classes at Metropolitan State University through Saturday, March 21. This suspension includes all face-to-face, hybrid, online, and independent study courses offerings and there will be no meetings of those course types next week.</p>
<p>The suspension does not cover internships, practica, student teaching, or clinicals at external sites. Students, you can report to those sites next week as long as the external site allows you to do so.</p>
<p>When instruction resumes on Monday, March 23 we will be providing all instruction in a modified way that emphasizes remote instruction. All instruction will continue in this modified, remote mode for the rest of the spring semester.</p>
<p><strong>Modified and Remote Instruction</strong></p>
<p>Starting Monday, March 23 all courses will be offered using instruction methods that will allow course completion remotely or, in very limited situations, with modified class sessions that allow social distancing. The following are options for providing remote instruction:</p>
<ul><li>Correspondence education via email;</li>
<li>Synchronous Zoom class meetings;</li>
<li>Lecture recordings using VoiceThread;</li>
<li>Online learning via Brightspace D2L; or</li>
<li>Some combination of the four.</li>
</ul><p>In very limited situations, like for labs and studio learning experiences that depend on particular equipment for learning, I will consider approving modified course sessions that will support social distancing in those specialized spaces.</p>
<p><strong>Faculty Planning and Preparations for Remote Instruction</strong></p>
<p>Faculty members will work next week to develop plans for remote instruction. You will be contacted by your faculty members by the end of Friday, March 20 with information about how your courses will proceed when they resume on Monday, March 23.</p>
<p><strong>Modifying Course Content and Activities</strong></p>
<p>This spring term will have 14 weeks of instruction, compared to the normal 15 weeks. Faculty are being asked to review the learning outcomes for the course and make modifications to the course content to accommodate this change. Faculty may also need to modify planned activities to adapt to remote instruction. Please understand that your courses will likely deviate from the syllabus that you’ve received. We will not extend the spring semester beyond Monday, May 4.</p>
<p><strong>Remote Instruction Support for Students</strong></p>
<p>I will send a separate Email next week with the training opportunities for you that will support remote instruction. In particular, we will provide training materials for accessing Brightspace D2L, Zoom, and other online learning tools.</p>
<p><strong>External Learning Sites</strong></p>
<p>Students will be allowed to continue their internships, practica, student teaching, clinical hours, and other experiential learning at external sites as long as the external sites allow them to attend. We know that many programs have minimum hours and/or competency- based assessments for these experiences. MN State and Metropolitan State University administrators are working to gather information from licensing boards and accreditation organizations to understand the impacts on students.</p>
<p><strong>Student Support </strong></p>
<p>Student support services will be offered either in-person or via remote formats. We are developing plans for the library and computer labs at Midway, MEC, and LECJEC to remain open to support students who may have limited computer and/or internet access. More details will be available next week.</p>
<p><strong>Communication</strong></p>
<p>Metropolitan State University is coordinating all communication through the Pandemic Planning Team to ensure that information that is communicated is accurate and consistent. Please monitor your email and the website, <a href="https://www.metrostate.edu/notices/covid-19">https://www.metrostate.edu/notices/covid-19</a> for updated information.</p>
<p>Please feel free to email <a href="mailto:covid-19@metrostate.edu">covid-19@metrostate.edu</a> with questions. This account is monitored continuously and, while you may not receive an answer individually, all students will receive updates with answers to the questions so you are all well-informed.</p>

<p><strong>Suspension of Course Instruction through Saturday, March 21 and Resumption of Instruction</strong></p>
<p>Chancellor Malhotra has suspended all classes at Metropolitan State University through Saturday, March 21. This suspension includes all face-to-face, hybrid, online, and independent study courses offerings. During this time, you cannot meet with or provide remote instruction to students. This does mean that our spring semester will have one less week of instruction, and it is important that all students have the same experience.</p>
<p>The suspension does not cover internships, practica, student teaching, or clinicals at external sites. Students can report to those sites next week as long as the external site allows them to do so.</p>
<p>When instruction resumes on Monday, March 23 we will be providing all instruction in a modified way that emphasizes remote instruction. All instruction will continue in this modified, remote mode for the rest of the spring semester. We understand that remote instruction may not be the best pedagogy for your courses and may not be your preferred way to engage students. However, this is an extraordinary situation that calls for us to do our best while supporting the health and well-being of students, faculty, staff, and the broader community.</p>
<p><strong>Modified and Remote Instruction</strong></p>
<p>Starting Monday, March 23 all courses will be offered using instruction methods that will allow course completion remotely or, in very limited situations, with modified class sessions that allow social distancing. The following are options for providing remote instruction:</p>
<ul><li>Correspondence education via email;</li>
<li>Synchronous Zoom class meetings;</li>
<li>Lecture recordings using VoiceThread;</li>
<li>Online learning via Brightspace D2L; or</li>
<li>Some combination of the three.</li>
</ul><p>In very limited situations, like for labs and studio learning experiences that depend on particular equipment for learning, I will consider approving modified course sessions that will support social distancing in those specialized spaces. In those cases, faculty can request approval to convene groups of 10 students or less at one time.</p>
<p>Faculty teaching face-to-face or hybrid courses that have 10 or fewer students enrolled, but do not required specialized space and/or equipment, are expected to use remote instruction methods for the rest of the semester.</p>
<p>Campus locations will remain open, for now, even though we are moving to remote instruction.</p>
<p><strong>Faculty Planning and Preparations for Remote Instruction</strong></p>
<p>All Resident Faculty are to report to their primary campus location starting Monday, March 16. Faculty will be engaged in course planning in their department and training activities related to remote instruction.</p>
<p>Departments are expected to meet to plan remote instruction for their courses, engaging both Resident and Community Faculty members in that planning. Department should plan at least one Zoom meeting that will allow Community Faculty members to participate in the planning. By the end of Wednesday, each department will send a plan for remote instruction to their dean. I understand that planning for remote instruction will be an on-going effort that will likely evolve over the remainder of the semester. Deans will work with faculty to support planning over the course of the next week. However, we do need to understand the plans by the end of Friday, March 20 to facilitate communication with students.</p>
<p>Departments are also asked to discuss approaches to increase flexibility for students who report being ill so there is a shared understanding of the approaches faculty members will take. It will be important to support students who become ill by being as flexible as possible with deadlines without negatively impacting the learning outcomes of the course.</p>
<p><strong>Modifying Course Content and Activities</strong></p>
<p>This spring term will have 14 weeks of instruction, compared to the normal 15 weeks. Faculty are asked to review the learning outcomes for the course and make modifications to the course content to accommodate this change. Faculty may also need to modify planned activities to adapt to remote instruction. We will not extend the spring semester beyond Monday, May 4.</p>
<p><strong>Training Support for Faculty Members</strong></p>
<p>I will send a separate Email with the training opportunities for faculty members that will support remote instruction. The Center for Online Learning, Center for Faculty Development, IT Services, and the MN State System all have developed training materials that will be very helpful.</p>
<p><strong>External Learning Sites</strong></p>
<p>Students will be allowed to continue their internships, practica, student teaching, clinical hours, and other experiential learning at external sites as long as the external sites allow them to attend. We know that many programs have minimum hours and/or competency- based assessments for these experiences. MN State and Metropolitan State University administrators are working to gather information from licensing boards and accreditation organizations to understand the impacts on students. If the external site does not allow internship students to attend, I ask that the faculty work with students to develop alternative, applied learning experiences that could take the place of the missing hours.</p>
<p><strong>Supporting Students</strong></p>
<p>Student support services will be offered either in-person or via remote formats. We are developing plans for the library and computer labs at Midway, MEC, and LECJEC to remain open to support students who may have limited computer and/or internet access. More details will be available next week.</p>
<p><strong>Communication</strong></p>
<p>Metropolitan State University is coordinating all communication through the Pandemic Planning Team to ensure that information that is communicated is accurate and consistent. This does mean that all communication is reviewed by a group of people which slows the process. Please monitor your email and the website for updated information.</p>
<p>We will send a message to students today clarifying that we will be using remote instruction starting Monday, March 23 and they will hear from their faculty members about their plans for remote instruction by the end of Friday, March 20.</p>
<p>Please feel free to email me with questions. I may not answer each individual email but will update all faculty with answers to the questions so you are all well-informed.</p>
<p>Best regards,<br />
Amy</p>

            <p>As a follow-up to today’s message from the Chancellor, I’d like to reiterate that the University’s Spring Break will be extended one week and all classes, including those which are already offered fully online or in a hybrid format, are suspended. This is to keep all academic activity on the same schedule. While classes are suspended, all university locations remain open.</p>
<p><strong>WEEK OF MARCH 16:</strong></p>
<p>Beginning Monday, March 16, our top priority will be to work with faculty and staff to find the best alternatives to face-to-face instruction. Administrators, faculty and staff are expected to report to work. During this week, we will focus on helping teaching faculty prepare to deliver their courses in <em>alternative </em>formats, including online and other means of delivery. The provost is working with the Center for Online Learning staff, deans and others on campus to determine how to organize and deliver these supportive activities. <strong><em>More information about this work will be forthcoming by Monday morning, at the latest.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>TRAVEL:</strong></p>
<p>In addition to the suspension of classes and extension of spring break for our students, the Chancellor has suspended all out-of-state travel, beginning on or after Monday, March 16. If you have university funded travel planned on Friday, March 13 or over the weekend, please carefully weigh the risks and benefits of such travel and make a prudent decision that maintains your safety. Please check the CDC website at <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-in-us.html#reporting-cases" target="_blank">https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-in-us.html#reporting-cases</a> to determine the incidence of COVID-19 cases in the locale to which you will be traveling. CFO Tracy Hatch is working on documenting a process to assist you with cancellation of your travel and for requesting exceptions to the no-travel rule. Provost Gort is developing a process so that PDG funds that are unused this spring can be carried forward to the next fiscal year for the awardees. <strong><em>Both will communicate the details of these processes early next week.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>GATHERINGS AND EVENTS:</strong></p>
<p>Minnesota State has cancelled all gatherings and events that are likely to have more than 100 attendees. We are currently developing a report of all events to estimate their size and determine if they must be cancelled. Currently we know the Open House scheduled for March 31 will be cancelled.</p>
<p>This spring’s commencement ceremonies are scheduled for April 26. We are asking the Chancellor’s office to consider allowing us to defer cancellation of this important event for our students, their families and the university until we have more information or are able to plan to move it beyond the May 1 date. <strong><em>More information will be provided next week.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS:</strong></p>
<p>This afternoon, college and university presidents are required to submit questions concerning their specific campuses, which will be answered during a conference call tomorrow morning with the Chancellor and Vice Chancellors. Our questions include the status of practicum, clinical and community engagement activities, graduation, and various HR related issues. <strong><em>I will report on those questions and answers in a message to faculty and staff tomorrow</em></strong>. I expect that over the next week or two there will likely be daily update messages.</p>
<p>We will continue to share information on our website, as well, at <a href="https://www.metrostate.edu/notices/covid-19">https://www.metrostate.edu/notices/covid-19</a>. Be sure to encourage students to bookmark this page and to check it often for updates. We have developed a plan to communicate with students in multiple ways including emails, phone messaging, text messaging, the website, and D2L.</p>
<p>We are also asking System Office IT to set up a special email account for this situation so all can submit their questions to a single source that will be continually monitored. This will be shared as soon as possible.</p>
<p>I know this is a lot of information to take in and there is still much uncertainty. Please be assured that we are working diligently to respond in ways that protect our students and employees. We will be communicating frequently and the website <a href="https://www.metrostate.edu/notices/covid-19">https://www.metrostate.edu/notices/covid-19</a>, will be continually updated.</p>
<p>Thank you and be well!</p>

            <p>Minnesota State is continuously reviewing a range of strategies to limit the spread of COVID-19 and its impact on our campuses and the communities in which we live and serve. I am committed to taking all steps necessary to protect the health and safety of our students, our faculty, and our staff.</p>
<p>All faculty, staff, and students are encouraged to heed the guidance of the <a href="https://www.health.state.mn.us/diseases/coronavirus" target="_blank">Minnesota Department of Health</a>, and in particular, staying home when sick, covering your cough, and practicing good hand hygiene.</p>
<p><strong>Today, I am announcing that the 32 Minnesota State colleges and universities that are currently on Spring Break will suspend classes March 16-22, with classes resuming March 23. </strong></p>
<p><strong>The five Minnesota State colleges that have Spring Break scheduled the week of March 16-20 will suspend classes March 23-29, with classes resuming March 30.</strong></p>
<p>While there will be no classes during each campuses’ extra week, administrators, faculty, and staff will spend that week exploring alternative modes of delivery and adjust campus learning spaces to ensure the safety of our communities. All campuses, including residence halls, dining facilities, and student support services will remain open and appropriately staffed, including student workers.</p>
<p><strong>Minnesota State-Related Travel</strong></p>
<p>Minnesota State suspended all school and business-related international travel effective February 28.</p>
<p>In addition, we are now suspending all out-of-state business travel for students, faculty, and staff, effective March 16. For in-state travel or other events, please carefully assess, along with supervisors, the conditions of destination communities to carefully consider the potential risks to yourself, participants, fellow students, families, and friends. Event hosts and coordinators should also be engaged in this assessment. If you choose to travel, ensure you have essential items you might need if you are not able to return immediately, such as medications, laptops, or other items needed to continue your studies.</p>
<p><strong>Campus Cleanliness</strong></p>
<p>The cleanliness of our campuses is a key element in keeping our faculty, staff, and students healthy. The facilities and maintenance teams at all the campuses are adhering to updated guidance from the CDC to ensure comfortable and safe campuses within which to learn.</p>
<p><strong>Large Events </strong></p>
<p>All events or other gatherings totaling more than 100 attendees are cancelled until May 1, and the situation will be re-evaluated.</p>
<p><strong>Minnesota Department of Health</strong></p>
<p>Should a case of COVID-19 occur on a campus, the Minnesota Department of Health will confirm the case and lead efforts to identify all those who were in contact with the ill person and give further instructions. If you are concerned that you have been exposed, please self-quarantine and contact your doctor, your campus’s student services to alert them, as well as your faculty to ensure you are able to keep up with class assignments.</p>
<p>The diversity of our student body and employees is one of our greatest strengths. As such, we are committed to ensuring welcoming and supportive campus environments for all of our students, faculty, and staff. It is vitally important we work together, follow the practices recommended by public health officials, and proceed with preparedness, calm, and understanding.</p>
<p>I recognize that these are stressful times and want to reassure you that the faculty and staff at your college/university are available to assist you through this time.</p>
<p>For more information, continue to visit: <a href="https://minnstate.edu/coronavirus/index.html">https://minnstate.edu/coronavirus/index.html</a> and your college/university website.</p>

            <p>Dear students,</p>
<p>As you know, the spread of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is now impacting many countries around the world. I want to assure you that my top priority is the health and safety of our students, faculty, and staff at all 37 colleges and universities within the Minnesota State system.</p>
<p>For this reason and out of an abundance of caution, I suspended all school and business-related international travel, effective February 28, 2020. If you are impacted by the travel suspension, I encourage you to contact your college or university for guidance. We are working in close partnership with our colleges and universities with the goal to ease potential impact of this temporary disruption of travel abroad. We will continue to monitor the situation and review our travel restrictions as new information emerges with regard to the size and scope of the threat associated with COVID-19.</p>
<p>In addition, we continue to work closely with our colleges and universities and the Minnesota Department of Health to monitor developments and proactively address school-related topics as it pertains to COVID-19. To date, there have been no positive cases of COVID-19 in Minnesota nor associated with any Minnesota State college or university.</p>
<p>I know many of you are eagerly looking forward to spring break. To protect yourself and your community from COVID-19 or other infectious diseases, good hygiene is the first line of defense. According to the Minnesota Department of Health, schools do not need to take special precautions beyond what is normally recommended to prevent the spread of viruses.</p>
<p>Everyday prevention measures like washing your hands with soap and water, covering coughs and sneezes, and staying home when sick reduces the risk of spreading respiratory infections. If you experience the most frequently reported signs and symptoms of fever, cough, muscle aches, fatigue or shortness of breath and are concerned about your health, please contact your doctor or your city, county, or state department of health.</p>
<p>I recognize that managing uncertainty during an evolving, complex situation can be unnerving and challenging. For the most current information, please visit our website. Your college or university website offers local insight and additional information, as well.</p>
<p>My wish for you all is good health and a restorative spring break.</p>
<p>Sincerely,<br />
Devinder Malhotra<br />
Chancellor</p>

            <p>Dear Metropolitan State community,</p>
<p>Metropolitan State University and the Minnesota State system office are closely monitoring the potential spread of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), and are revising plans to protect students and staff, and to support the local community. Coronavirus is a viral respiratory illness with symptoms of fever, cough, and shortness of breath. Symptoms may appear two to 14 days after exposure. The Minnesota Department of Health is advising that the risk of becoming sick with Coronavirus at this time in Minnesota is low. We also understand that this situation is unpredictable and could change.</p>
<p>Given the risks associated with COVID-19, and out of an abundance of caution, under System Procedure 5.19.3, Travel Management, Part 10, subpart f, Minnesota State’s Chancellor has suspended all international travel. This includes study abroad programs and any other activities involving faculty, staff, or students.</p>
<p>Metropolitan State University is proactively outlining actions that would be taken in the event of significant student or staff absences as a result of the virus. This plan primarily focuses on actions to be taken at our locations and those sites where our courses and educational activities are offered, and may vary as needed. The University will follow infection control recommendations from the Department of Health.</p>
<p>As we develop plans, we will consider the following issues and address campus operations, including:</p>
<ul><li>Reporting of student and staff absences – we encourage supervisors and faculty to offer flexibility to employees and students who are sick or caring for sick family members;</li>
<li>Attendance policies and grading considerations;</li>
<li>Flexible learning options;</li>
<li>Travel requirements;</li>
<li>Campus cleaning protocols;</li>
<li>Prevention strategies and education;</li>
<li>Communication to employees and students.</li>
</ul><p>In addition, we ask you to stay home if you are sick or experiencing respiratory symptoms:</p>
<ul><li>Take precautions recommended for avoiding colds and flu;</li>
<li>Wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water;</li>
<li>Cover your cough;</li>
<li>Consult with your health provider if necessary.</li>
</ul><p>For more information, read <a href="https://www.health.state.mn.us/diseases/coronavirus/schools.html" target="_blank">Information For Schools and Child Care on Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)</a> from the State of Minnesota Department of Health.</p>
<p>Anyone in the U.S. who has not traveled to China or been in contact with someone confirmed or suspected to have COVID-19 in the last 14 days is at low risk of becoming sick with the virus. Any actions or language against anyone based on race, ethnicity, national origin, or religion in connection with the origins of COVID-19 are unacceptable. Such actions will be addressed within appropriate university procedures.</p>
<p>The University will continue to work in partnership with the Minnesota State System Office for the care and protection of its staff, students and faculty and with a commitment to the continuity of the student learning experience.</p>
<p>Sincerely,<br />
Virginia “Ginny” Arthur, JD<br />
President</p>
