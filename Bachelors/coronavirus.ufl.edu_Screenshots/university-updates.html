  <p>The Florida Board of Governors, the State University System’s governing board, has approved a broad&nbsp;<a href="/media/coronavirusufledu/SUS-Blueprint.pdf">SUS blueprint</a>&nbsp;for reopening the state’s public universities this fall. The blueprint stresses as a foundational priority the health and welfare of students, faculty, staff and others while giving individual universities flexibility in their reopening rules, procedures and guidelines. Under the blueprint, universities are developing their own reopening plans.</p>
<p>The University of Florida’s&nbsp;<a href="/media/coronavirusufledu/draft-plan.pdf">draft plan</a> outlines how UF will strive to create a safer, healthier campus environment and continue its research and education missions using screening and testing, enhanced protective measures, comprehensive communications and other tools.</p>
<p>We welcome input on the UF plan. Please send your comments to&nbsp;<a href="mailto:reopen@ufl.edu">reopen@ufl.edu</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The UF Board of Trustees&nbsp;unanimously approved the plan during its June 5 meeting. The plan will be submitted to the Board of Governors by the June 12 deadline. It is expected the plan will continue to evolve as circumstances with COVID-19 evolve globally and locally.</p>

  <p>Alachua County mandated emergency "stay at home" orders effective at midnight, Monday, March 23. UF is reducing on-campus personnel to those identified as essential, starting today. If you are unsure about whether this includes you, your manager will be able to provide you with guidance and more details about what this entails. If you have been approved to work from home, please do so. If you have been identified as essential and your job requires you to remain on campus, please practice social distancing, maintaining at least a 6-foot distance between yourself and others whenever possible. The University of Florida is firmly committed to prioritizing our community’s health and safety to the greatest extent possible.</p>

  <p>As cases of COVID-19 continue to spread around the globe, the University of Florida continues to closely monitor the rapidly evolving situation and is prepared to respond appropriately. To date, no cases have been reported at UF or elsewhere in Florida. Sixteen cases of COVID-19 are confirmed in the U.S. While the immediate risk to the general U.S. public is considered low, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advise the virus will likely cause a global pandemic and is urging Americans to prepare much as they would for a hurricane. According to the CDC,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/csels/dsepd/ss1978/lesson1/section11.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a pandemic</a>&nbsp;refers to an increase in cases that spreads over several countries or continents, usually impacting a large amount of people.</p>
