  <p>The Florida Board of Governors, the State University System’s governing board, has approved a broad&nbsp;<a href="/media/coronavirusufledu/SUS-Blueprint.pdf">SUS blueprint</a>&nbsp;for reopening the state’s public universities this fall. The blueprint stresses as a foundational priority the health and welfare of students, faculty, staff and others while giving individual universities flexibility in their reopening rules, procedures and guidelines. Under the blueprint, universities are developing their own reopening plans.</p>
<p>The University of Florida’s&nbsp;<a href="/media/coronavirusufledu/draft-plan.pdf">draft plan</a> outlines how UF will strive to create a safer, healthier campus environment and continue its research and education missions using screening and testing, enhanced protective measures, comprehensive communications and other tools.</p>
<p>We welcome input on the UF plan. Please send your comments to&nbsp;<a href="mailto:reopen@ufl.edu">reopen@ufl.edu</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The UF Board of Trustees&nbsp;unanimously approved the plan during its June 5 meeting. The plan will be submitted to the Board of Governors by the June 12 deadline. It is expected the plan will continue to evolve as circumstances with COVID-19 evolve globally and locally.</p>

	<dt tabindex='0' id="faq_805659"><a id="d.en.805659"></a>Does the university have an emergency management plan? (6/30)</dt>
	<dd><p>The University of Florida has a Comprehensive Emergency Management Plan, which is publicly posted on our <a href="http://emergency.ufl.edu/emergency%20management-plans/">website.</a> The purpose of this plan is to facilitate preparedness and actions for responding to a myriad of events that pose a threat to the safety and security of our students, patients, faculty and staff. These threats range from hurricanes to the challenges associated with the current COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>Our emergency management plan creates structures within the university, with dictated roles and responsibilities guiding the efforts of individuals in every facet of our large academic and healthcare communities. Leading the university’s emergency management response is a group of senior leaders and staff members representing our health colleges, hospitals, academics, and operational management, among others. Among the group’s primary responsibilities are actions currently taking place at UF:</p>
<ul>
<li>Providing information and recommendations during this public health emergency, with the Student Health Care Center director serving as the university’s lead public health official.</li>
<li>Providing health services and resources, including medical and behavioral health, for UF students and employees.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Coordinating operations and programs specific to public health such as mass vaccination clinics and alternate medical treatment sites, as evidenced by the recently opened COVID-19 testing facility in The Villages.</li>
<li>Facilitating information and education for the university community.</li>
</ul>
<p>The university also has a more detailed plan that guides its response to infectious disease spread and pandemics. These documents are exempt from public disclosure pursuant to Florida Statute 1004.0962 (Campus emergency response) due to the fact that they contain sensitive information that, if publicly released, could create a security risk for the university’s students, faculty and staff.</p>
<p>The university is committed to transparency regarding its response to and management of campus operations during the COVID-19 outbreak.</p></dd>

	<dd><p>When returning to campus, all students, faculty and staff are asked to adhere to the following practices.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Physical Distancing</strong>: Whenever possible, students, faculty, staff and visitors must maintain a physical distance of 6 feet from others while on the University of Florida properties and in common spaces until further notice.</li>
<li><strong>Face Coverings</strong>: All patients, visitors, faculty, staff, students, volunteers and vendors are required to wear a mask or cloth face covering when in UF and&nbsp;UF&nbsp;Health&nbsp;facilities, with only a few exceptions for children less than 2 years old or those who are ill. For those who are unable to wear a face covering, face shields will be an acceptable alternative. Face coverings are to be worn in all classrooms, in patient care areas, and when in public/common areas, including lobbies, conference rooms, elevators, stairwells, bathrooms and lounges. Face coverings are also required on employee and visitor shuttles. Exceptions include when in private offices, private work spaces with adequate physical barriers, and well-ventilated outdoor spaces where appropriate physical distancing can be maintained.&nbsp;​​</li>
<li><strong>Wash Hands Frequently</strong>: Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the bathroom; before eating; and after blowing your nose, coughing or sneezing. If soap and water are not readily available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol. Always wash hands with soap and water if hands are visibly dirty.</li>
<li><strong>Stay Home When Sick: If you are sick, please stay home.</strong> Avoid close contact with people who are sick.</li>
