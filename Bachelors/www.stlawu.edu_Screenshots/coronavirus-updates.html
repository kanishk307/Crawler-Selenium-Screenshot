<p>Student-Athletes,</p>
<p>I am writing to you today with some good news. Earlier today, in collaboration with the Liberty League, St. Lawrence University&nbsp;announced&nbsp;an agreement on a plan for a return to athletic competition this fall with a limited schedule and later than usual start. I firmly believe this plan allows us to work through the uncertainty of the situation and gives us a chance to complete the fall season as safely as possible.</p>
<p>Fall competition in most sports will begin no earlier than Saturday, September 26. Student-athletes approved for the fall semester should plan to participate in a phased move-in, by appointment and with mandated testing upon arrival,&nbsp;with the rest of the approved students starting August 19. More information will be available on returning to campus in the coming weeks.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>All teams will complete the first two phases of the guidelines outlined in the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.ncaa.org/sport-science-institute/core-principles-resocialization-collegiate-sport" target="_blank">NCAA’s Core Principles of Resocialization of Collegiate Sport</a>&nbsp;prior to engaging in competition. St. Lawrence athletic teams will adhere to all state and local directives regarding athletics competition.</p>
<p>The coaching staff and I are excited to see Saints teams back competing. The plan calls for contests predominantly against Liberty League member institutions while including a limited number of non-league opportunities following phased resocialization. Teams competing in individual sports will compete in smaller events with fewer competitors. Fall schedules remain in development and will be announced at a later date when available. There is currently a committee in the Liberty League working on possible schedules for winter sports. A league-wide decision on permitting spectators at athletic events will be made by September 1.</p>
<p>Let me be clear that our top priority at St. Lawrence is the health and safety of our entire campus community. I have spent the past months, along with my team in the athletics department, in intensive dialogue developing protocols and plans for the safe return to athletics. The plan is a work in progress and will be finalized throughout the summer. There will be new guidelines and protocols for the Littlejohn Athletic Training Center, the Michael “Buddy” Cornacchia ’74 Strength and Conditioning Center, and the Stafford Fitness Center, as well as team locker rooms. There will also be policies for testing, retesting, and a protocol if a student-athlete, coach, or other athletic staff member tests positive for COVID-19.</p>
<p>There will be COVID-19 training and educational sessions for all of our student-athletes so everyone understands the importance of these guidelines. The lack of understanding or execution could lead to infection and a termination of our playing seasons.</p>
<p>As you know, during the 2020-21 academic year St. Lawrence will offer three semesters of courses with each student taking courses in two of these three semesters. We know you have indicated your status as a varsity student-athlete in completing the semester preference survey that was due at the end of last week. We will communicate full details of which semesters students will be studying in no later than Wednesday, July 15.</p>
<p>I know you will have many questions in the days and weeks ahead. I have asked each of our coaches to plan a team meeting via Zoom very soon to answer questions and concerns. I believe our plan for athletics provides a quality and competitive season for our student-athletes in a way that will be safe and healthy for all involved.&nbsp;<a id="June-23" name="June-23"></a></p>
<p>Go Saints!</p>
<p>Bob Durocher<br />
Athletic Director&nbsp;</p>
<h2>June 23 Message to Students, Parents, and Employees from Hagi Bradley, Vice President and Dean of Student Life, and Karl Schonberg, Vice President of the University and Dean of Academic Affairs</h2>
<p>Dear Laurentian community,</p>
<p>Last week <a href="https://www.stlawu.edu/covid-19/coronavirus-updates#june-16">we announced</a> our intention to have an in-person semester with as many students on campus in the fall as we can safely have in&nbsp;our classrooms, dining facilities, and residence halls, and we promised more details in the weeks ahead.&nbsp;With New York State guidelines for reopening colleges and universities posted Saturday evening, June 20, we are now able to provide further information on our plans for the 2020-21 academic year.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When considering options, every decision we make is being guided by these principles:</p>
<ul>
<li>The University remains&nbsp;committed to its mission: to provide an inspiring liberal arts experience for students from all over the world who come here with purpose and promise.</li>
<li>The safety and well-being of our entire campus community remains our top priority.</li>
<li>Decision making will be as inclusive&nbsp;and&nbsp;equitable&nbsp;as possible and will be done in consultation with local public health officials, and guidance from federal and state agencies.</li>
<li>Flexibility and innovation will be required, which extends to our responsibility for the long-term financial strength of the institution.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Campus Occupancy</h3>
<p>Although we would like to have every student back on campus, our <a href="https://www.stlawu.edu/covid-19/emergency-planning-team-and-committees">planning teams</a> have determined that we can have no more than 1,800 students on campus at any one time in order to provide the safest living and learning environment according to current public health standards. We will need to have distance between people as they attend classes, wait for food, use restrooms, and pass one another in hallways. In addition, we must reserve appropriate on-campus quarantine space. This level of occupancy will require us to adapt to new habits. And in the spirit of community safety, patience and flexibility will continue to be expected of everyone.</p>
<h3>Revised 2020-2021 Academic Calendar</h3>
<p>Given our decision to reduce capacity, we will offer three semesters of courses with each student taking courses in two of these three semesters.</p>
<p>The Fall 2020 and Spring 2021 semesters will be 15 weeks in length. The Summer 2021 semester will be condensed into 10 weeks, with courses offered both for the duration of the 10-week session and in two five-week mini-sessions. The offerings for Summer 2021 will include new off-campus study options and expand the number of on-campus and online courses, allowing for more variety than is traditionally offered.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Fall 2020 Semester:
<ul>
<li>Classes begin August 26 – Last day of finals December 11</li>
<li>Mid-semester break is cancelled and students who choose to leave for Thanksgiving break, which will be from Wednesday, November 25 through Sunday, November 29, will be required to complete the remainder of the semester, including finals, at home.&nbsp;
<ul>
<li>Students who are on campus may stay through Thanksgiving break and the end of the fall semester if they wish. On-campus housing and support services will continue, but all coursework after Thanksgiving, including final exams, will be conducted remotely to accommodate those who wish to depart at Thanksgiving.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Spring 2021 Semester:
<ul>
<li>Classes begin January 4; Last day of finals April 16</li>
<li>Mid-semester and spring breaks are cancelled.<br />
		&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Summer 2021 Semester:
<ul>
<li>Classes begin May 3; Last day of finals July 9
<ul>
<li>For 10-week courses:
<ul>
<li>Classes begin May 3; Last day of finals July 9</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>For 5-week classes:
<ul>
<li>Classes begin May 3 – Last day of finals June 4&nbsp;</li>
<li>Classes begin June 7 – Last day of finals July 9</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>&nbsp;Room and board charges will be prorated due to a shorter time spent on campus.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Students’ Return to Campus</h3>
<p>All first-year students, new transfer students, newly readmitted students, and seniors will be given priority to be on campus during the Fall 2020 semester. We anticipate that most sophomores and juniors will be able to return as well, but since we know that many of those who will not be on campus in the fall will be sophomores or juniors, we are designing the Summer 2021 semester to provide the educational experiences, including off-campus study, that are often part of these class years’ St. Lawrence experiences.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Later today, we will send a student survey to seek individual preferences. It is critical that students complete this survey by Friday, July 3, and provide as much detail as possible, as it will guide our decision-making processes for the fall. We hope to arrive at the target number of 1,800 students for fall voluntarily, through students choosing the options that will work best for them. However, should we need to do so in the interest of campus safety, we will assign students particular semesters. In fall and spring, we will also offer some courses fully online so that any single student who wishes to complete a full semester from home may do so by enrolling in those courses, paying regular tuition but without being charged room and board. We will communicate full details of which semesters students will be studying in no later than Wednesday, July 15.</p>
<h3>Class Format: What to Expect</h3>
<p>Classes on campus will be different from in the past, to reduce occupancy in classrooms for safety reasons, and also recognizing that some students may not be able to be on campus for all or part of the semester. Most classes will be offered through a combination of in-person and virtual instruction. Faculty will have discretion to teach in-person, remotely, or in combined modes. Some courses will be fully virtual, whether the class members are living on campus or elsewhere, and students on campus should anticipate that they will have courses that combine online and in-person teaching and some that are entirely online. Most courses previously scheduled for the fall and anticipated for the spring will be taught in those two semesters.</p>
<p>Professors are working throughout this summer to prepare courses that will be engaging and exciting, whether they are meeting in person, partially, or fully online. We are all committed to offering great St. Lawrence classes in which faculty and students work closely with one another to explore the course material in ways that reflect the best St. Lawrence traditions, no matter what the mode of class delivery. We are working intensively with our faculty and academic departments on all logistics of the St. Lawrence curriculum for next year that will best serve our mission.</p>
<h3>2020-21 Housing</h3>
<p>Due to students’ academic plans and the need to reserve on-campus quarantine space throughout the year, our Residence Life team will likely need to reassess and rework many housing assignments. Additional information about that process will be sent after decisions are made regarding which semesters students will be studying in (after Wednesday, July 15).</p>
<h3>Campus Life Town Halls</h3>
<p>We will host town halls for each class year the week of June 29 to provide students and families with more information before our July 3 survey deadline. More details on these town halls are forthcoming.</p>
<h3>Athletics</h3>
<p>If intercollegiate varsity athletic programs are permitted this fall, the expectation for competition is a late start in September or early October in a compressed schedule. We are working closely with leadership from the Department of Athletics on how to ensure a safe return to competition and will release more information when available.</p>
<h3>Health and Safety Practices</h3>
<p>All members of our campus community will be required to change their personal safety practices when they return to campus. Information on employees, including faculty requirements, can be found on the <a href="https://www.stlawu.edu/covid-19/employee-information">COVID-19 website</a>. Each University department is also required to submit a safety plan that will be approved by the Return to Work planning team.</p>
<p>Students will be asked to sign a <strong><em>Social Contract</em></strong> before returning. It will include consent to be tested for COVID-19 upon arrival on campus and about two weeks later, as well as other times throughout the semester. It will also include instructions on how to practice social distancing, wear a mask, and gather in ways that public health experts deem safe. If students are not willing to follow the necessary rules, they should not plan to be on campus this fall.</p>
<h3>New York State Guidance</h3>
<p>New York State’s guidelines for higher education are specific in some places to higher ed, but also recognize the composite nature of higher education and direct colleges and universities to follow the guidance for relevant industries or functions. For example, higher education offices must follow the guidance for safe re-opening of offices, while dining facilities must follow the guidance for indoor dining at restaurants. Our plan follows the mandatory state and local health and safety guidelines. We believe it is the best approach to mitigate the risk of infection so we may look forward to a complete and positive in-person semester and year.&nbsp;<a id="june-16" name="june-16"></a></p>
<p>Our planning teams continue to meet daily to develop the comprehensive safety plans necessary at every level, to recommend changes, and to implement them where needed. We know that there are many more questions left to answer, and we appreciate your patience as we work on additional details. We will communicate regularly throughout the coming weeks and will continue to send information to the community as it is available.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Hagi Bradley, Vice President and Dean of Student Life<br />
Karl Schonberg, Vice President of the University and Dean of Academic Affairs</p>
<h2>June 16 Message to Students, Parents, and Employees from Hagi Bradley, Vice President and Dean of Student Life, and Karl Schonberg, Vice President of the University and Dean of Academic Affairs</h2>
<p>Dear Laurentian community,</p>
<p>We write to you today to share an update about planning for the fall semester and the 2020-2021 academic year at St. Lawrence University.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Planning Process</strong><br />
We intend to have an in-person semester with as many students as we can safely have in&nbsp;our dining facilities, residence halls, and classrooms on campus in the fall. We will have extensive measures in place to ensure the safety of all students, faculty, and staff. The health and safety of the St. Lawrence University community remains our top priority. We have upgraded our infrastructure and capacity for course instruction and campus safety, and will continue to do so over the summer, to ensure we are ready for any scenario that might present itself in the coming year. Finally, we await guidance from New York State to refine our plans, in order to ensure that they are fully aligned with all state requirements for safe reopening.</p>
<p><strong>Fall Semester </strong><br />
Our current planning anticipates an in-person semester with phased return of students in the last week of August and online or hybrid instruction of courses to the extent needed for community safety throughout the semester. &nbsp;The methods of instruction in individual courses will vary based on changing circumstances, course content, and faculty discretion. Details regarding the semester calendar and student return to campus will be forthcoming in the weeks ahead, as soon as they are available. The fall 2020 semester will begin as scheduled with the first day of classes on Wednesday, August 26.</p>
<p>Our planning teams are meeting regularly to review the academic calendar, student life, athletics, and safety plans at every level, and to recommend and then implement all the changes that will be needed. In doing this, we must take all the time necessary to be certain our plans are as thorough and effective as possible.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Fall 2020 Off-Campus Study</strong><br />
The University Senior Staff has accepted the recommendation of the Student Safe Travel Committee to cancel all remaining study abroad programs for the Fall 2020 semester. Students and families have been notified and there is a process in place for them to continue their academic progress next year.</p>
<p><strong>Employees</strong><br />
The Campus Safe Occupancy&nbsp;planning team is working with divisional and departmental leadership to develop plans for employees to return to work in every area. For every employee:</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If an employee can continue to work from home, remote work should be expected and continued.</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Any employee who is sick should stay home.</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If an employee qualifies to return to work, if the employee’s supervisor agrees that on-site work is necessary, if the department has developed and received approval for a work-safety plan, and the employee receives written guidance from Human Resources before returning, then the employee may return and must abide by safety protocols.</p>
<p><strong>Feedback</strong><br />
As we pursue this work, we have heard feedback from students and faculty in surveys and other venues, and will continue to seek all ideas and questions. We ask that you take advantage of every opportunity to contribute your perspectives. They are vitally needed in our planning, to ensure that we meet the hopes and needs of the entire Laurentian community as best we can.</p>
<p><a id="June-1" name="June-1"></a>Though many questions remain to be answered, we know we must plan for a fall semester that will require each of us of to adapt in many ways, and in the spirit of community safety, patience and flexibility will be asked of everyone. We will work together as part of the Laurentian community we all value, even as our day-to-day lives will change, as they must, for the welfare of that community and all its members.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Hagi Bradley, Vice President and Dean of Student Life<br />
Karl Schonberg, Vice President of the University and Dean of Academic Affairs</p>
<h2>June 1 Message to Employees from President William L. Fox</h2>
<p>Dear Laurentian friends,</p>
<p>The world hurts and the times dismay. The St. Lawrence community’s sudden adjustment this spring to remote learning and stay-at-home work was astonishing. I am deeply grateful for all the extra touches and hours that concluded the semester successfully. I wish, of course, that mobilization of creative impulses would be enough to close the heavy door of the worldwide crisis of human health and welfare. This is so much bigger than any college has had to face since the 1930s. Thank you, thank you most simply and profoundly.</p>
<p>I write to you today to outline the financial impacts that the COVID-19 pandemic has had on St. Lawrence, including the specific first steps the University must take to mitigate loss and harm.</p>
<p>Since the all-staff budget and finance town hall in late April, the financial results from the past fiscal year have crystalized. We expect to see more than $7 million in deficit operating results as we close this fiscal year (FY2020). Room and board refunds and credits, a dip in fundraising correlated to global market and job losses, and the already uncertain national landscape of enrollment levels are all contributing factors to having less revenue than was budgeted or that can be projected going forward.</p>
<p>Our circumstances require us to make hard decisions. They are in the context of forces touching every college in America. When considering options, every decision we make is being guided by three principles:</p>
<ul>
<li>The University remains&nbsp;committed to its mission: to provide an inspiring liberal arts experience for students from all over the world who come here with purpose and promise.</li>
<li>The safety and well-being of our entire campus community, also our leadership role in the local community and economy, are top priorities.</li>
<li>There are many unknown factors related to the pandemic and its subsequent crisis economy. St. Lawrence will need to respond incrementally to circumstances as the economy’s performance continues to evolve. Many of these financial elements may carry unfavorable costs and will be assessed again in the fall after we know more about student enrollment.</li>
</ul>
<p>In consultation with the Board of Trustees, Senior Staff, the Salary and Benefits Committee, the Budget and Finance Committee, and the Faculty Council, I have made the difficult decision to implement the following response mechanisms. Our estimates indicate that we should save $6 million or more with these measures in FY21.</p>
<p><strong>Senior Leadership</strong></p>
<p>In the spirit of shared sacrifice within our community, members of the Senior Staff and I have voluntarily and immediately reduced our compensation. In my case, I have cut my compensation by 15 percent. The rest of Senior Staff&nbsp;each&nbsp;will reduce&nbsp;their salaries&nbsp;by 8 percent for the 2020-21 fiscal year. Each of us also will experience a 4% reduction in the University’s contribution to our 403(b) retirement plans. It is important to note that there are also other members of our community that have joined senior staff in taking voluntary cuts to their compensation.</p>
<p><strong>Faculty, Exempt, and Non-Union Staff with TIAA Contribution Retirement (403(b)) Plans</strong></p>
<p>Effective beginning July 1, the University will temporarily reduce its contribution to all faculty, exempt, and non-union staff 403(b) plans from 10 percent to 6 percent of eligible compensation. The University will continue to evaluate the overall economic environment for St. Lawrence, with a goal of restoring some or all of the reduced contribution as soon as it is prudent to do so.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Fiscal Year 2021 Salary Increases for Faculty, Exempt, and Non-Union Staff</strong></p>
<p>The University is freezing compensation increases for faculty, exempt, and non-union staff for the 2020-21 fiscal year. These were scheduled to go into effect on January 1, 2021.</p>
<p><strong>Open Positions and Hiring&nbsp;</strong><a name="personal-travel"></a></p>
<p>Searches for open positions have been frozen indefinitely.&nbsp; To be clear, the University does not anticipate new faculty tenure track searches in the coming academic year, and visiting assistant professor positions will be very limited.</p>
<p><strong>Capital Projects</strong></p>
<p>The University has set the capital budget for the 2020-21 fiscal year at $4 million, which is less than our traditional $6 million allocation.</p>
<p><strong>Union Employees</strong></p>
<p>The University is in good faith discussions with each of our three unions regarding contract terms and will communicate with employees covered by our collective bargaining process when agreements are reached.</p>
<p>As the University’s Fall 2020 planning committees develop options and as the pandemic progresses through the year, we may need to take additional measures to ensure St. Lawrence’s future financial security. I know the real-life impact our decisions have and will continue to have on each of you and your families. We want to keep you regularly and fully informed; you may count on our commitment to listen and answer your questions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Vice President for Finance and Administration Steve Hietsch will host a 60-minute virtual&nbsp;town hall for employees to provide an update on the&nbsp;financial&nbsp;implications of the COVID-19 pandemic for St. Lawrence on Wednesday, June 3, at 2:30 p.m. Faculty and staff will need to use their St. Lawrence University username and password to join.&nbsp;<a href="https://stlawu.zoom.us/j/96721402194">https://stlawu.zoom.us/j/96721402194</a></p>
<p>Implicit in our openness to providing updates, let me emphasize that we remain utterly conscientious about levels of salary, wages, and benefits, but will stay the course until it is reasonable and feasible to reconsider it. As one who has taught, read, and written history, it may take a long time. And the only way for us to endure, for St. Lawrence to persist, is in a spirit of togetherness, selflessness, and patience.&nbsp;<a id="May-29" name="May-29"></a></p>
<p>I deeply appreciate your continued, even heroic, dedication and hard work at St. Lawrence.</p>
<p>With abiding hope,</p>
<p>Bill Fox<br />
President</p>
<h2>May 29 Message to Employees from Lisa Cania, Vice President for Community and Employee Relations</h2>
<p>Dear Colleagues:</p>
<p>This provides up-to-date information about employees returning to work in any Phase. I probably wrote this memo four times in the last 24 hours.</p>
<p>On May 28, the Governor’s office announced that Phase 2, expected by many to begin May 29, would be placed on hold.&nbsp; &nbsp;At his 1 pm briefing May 29, Governor Cuomo announced that the north country region can reopen under Phase 2 effective immediately.&nbsp;&nbsp; Newly released <a href="https://nam01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fforward.ny.gov%2Fphase-two-industries&amp;data=02%7C01%7Clcania%40stlawu.edu%7Ca1fbe0b71567442e3ecb08d803fb8ff2%7Cbb31816d91e742198acbd6c0e715eb0c%7C1%7C1%7C637263726289490655&amp;sdata=G40z6oNMujLU55ZS%2FzsqBmykXOzQk0bWFE3ypIeeO7s%3D&amp;reserved=0">guidance for the Phase Two industries</a> which include Offices, Real Estate, In-Store Retail, Vehicle Sales, Commercial Building Management and Hair Salons/Barber Shops. The guidance has in fact changed throughout the course of the day, it is clearly an evolving thing.&nbsp;The guidance for <a href="https://nam01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.governor.ny.gov%2Fsites%2Fgovernor.ny.gov%2Ffiles%2Fatoms%2Ffiles%2Foffices-interim-guidance.pdf&amp;data=02%7C01%7Clcania%40stlawu.edu%7Ca1fbe0b71567442e3ecb08d803fb8ff2%7Cbb31816d91e742198acbd6c0e715eb0c%7C1%7C1%7C637263726289500651&amp;sdata=9On%2FeXW7J5CCUxLf0lj6VoZIf%2FcDOD2ZIxT3%2BgCFeT0%3D&amp;reserved=0">offices</a> now speaks to the opening of <strong>all office-based operations</strong> with <em>a specific mention of higher education administration</em> as an allowable function, but not reopening of all educational functions.&nbsp; We are seeking clarification to the many questions you might have.</p>
<p>With the news of Phase 2 opening, I remind us all of the overarching guidelines that do and will apply:</p>
<p><strong>For any employee and every employee in any phase:&nbsp; </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>If an employee can continue to work from home, remote work should be expected and continued.</li>
<li>Any employee who is sick should stay home.</li>
<li>If an employee qualifies to return to work, if the employee’s supervisor agrees that on-site work is necessary, and if the following protocols are followed, then employees may return.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Returning to Work</strong></p>
<p><strong>Before anyone can be returned to work, there is a review and approval process of a departmental or divisional “Work Safety Plan” among the newly assigned Return to Work team and the department’s senior staff member.</strong>&nbsp; Written Work Safety Plans are mandated by the state.&nbsp; Each department will be advised of a safety plan that will be required and returning employees will be informed about new protocols for <strong>confidential and mandatory</strong> <strong>daily health screenings</strong> before they can start work, as well as training for required PPE including masks, cleaning, and social distancing requirements as well as expectations for reporting illness.</p>
<p><strong>As we plan for more employees to return, all will receive letters from Human Resources about the new requirements for the daily health screening, PPE, and social distancing expectations…information they will need prior to their return date</strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Employees may not return to work before the letters are sent with this information, and the letters will be sent only after the departmental Work Safety Plan is approved by the Return to Work team and the senior staff leader</strong>.</p>
<p>Most importantly, employees will need to <strong>take their temperature</strong> each day before arriving at work and complete the web-based health screen questionnaire&nbsp; before every shift.&nbsp; If they do not have access online to do so before work, they can call their manager, HR (between 8am – 4pm) or Security to complete the form for them.&nbsp; <strong>Information will remain Confidential in HR or Security and only those offices will have access to responses.</strong></p>
<p>HR and Security will have a mechanism to review the health check responses and anyone who answers “yes” to any question is asked to stay home and call their manager to report their absence.&nbsp; <strong>These are compliance requirements for everyone who works on-site.&nbsp;</strong><a id="May-5" name="May-5"></a></p>

<h2>May 5 Message to Students, Parents, and Employees&nbsp;from Hagi Bradley, Vice President and Dean of Student Life, and Karl Schonberg, Vice President of the University and Dean of Academic Affairs</h2>
<p>Dear Campus Community,</p>
<p>As the semester draws to a close, we write to provide you with the most up-to-date information we have about obtaining belongings, room and board refunds and credits, and our Fall 2020 planning.</p>
<p>First, we wanted to say how impressed we have been with your flexibility, innovation, and support during the past two months as we have all dealt with a global pandemic. While we are still in the process of finishing Finals Week, we hope you take a moment to think about all you have accomplished and are as proud of your efforts as we are.</p>
<p>Over the last two months, students have shared their ideas, questions, and concerns with us and others. President Fox has hosted virtual Office Hours several times to provide students with opportunities to discuss those with him. Next week, <strong>President Fox is inviting students to join him for a Student Town Hall meeting on Wednesday, May 13, at 4:30 p.m. EDT. </strong><a href="https://stlawu.zoom.us/j/92745947574">https://stlawu.zoom.us/j/92745947574</a>. Students will need to use their St. Lawrence University username and password to join, and should <a href="https://www.stlawu.edu/university-communications/form/submit-your-questions-student-town-hall-president-fox">submit questions</a> that they have for him by Tuesday, May 12, at 12 p.m. EDT.</p>
<p><strong>Belongings</strong></p>
<p>We have heard a number of questions about how students will obtain their belongings. For those located outside of New York, Governor Cuomo announced&nbsp;the "New York State on PAUSE" executive order in mid-March. To comply, the University has had to reduce its on-campus workforce by 100 percent with the exception of those providing essential services to the nearly 100 students remaining on campus. We know the items that have been left behind are important, which is why our Residence Life team has worked diligently to finalize a plan that will allow students to obtain their belongings. Once government and public health officials declare it is safe, we will communicate the details of that plan to students and families.</p>
<p>If you have questions, please contact the Office of Residence Life at 315-229-5250 or email&nbsp;<a href="mailto:reslife@stlawu.edu">reslife@stlawu.edu</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Spring 2020 Room and Board Refunds/Credits</strong></p>
<p>In previous messages, the University has shared that we plan to provide refunds or credits for room and board charges, and we&nbsp;appreciate your patience as we continue to work through this individualized process. The University will first focus on our senior class, and then will calculate the amount credited to every other student’s account. St. Lawrence is committed to completing this process for families by the end of May.</p>
<p><strong>Fall 2020 Update</strong></p>
<p>As we shared in late April, the University has started a comprehensive planning process to ensure we continue to foster student learning, business continuity, and fiscal resiliency for the next academic year.&nbsp;We all hope to be back on campus and in person this fall. At the same time, we realize the need to plan for multiple contingencies based on public health conditions.</p>
<p>As part of our scenario planning for reopening the campus, and based on the best information we have at the moment, in order to be on campus this fall we would anticipate needing the availability of reliable and easily administered testing for COVID-19, with a short turnaround time for results. Second, we would require a robust capacity for contact tracing. Third, we would need to continue to observe some form of social distancing. Finally, there will be a need for quarantine space for those who might be infected. We are working to understand what it will take to meet all of these criteria, and are in regular communication and discussions with members of the St. Lawrence County Public Health Department, as well as officials from the St. Lawrence Health System.</p>
<p>Many have asked when we expect to have certainty about the fall, and our best answer is we don’t know yet when this will be. We know that all Laurentians wish to be together again on campus, and need time to make their plans to return, but also that we must take the time needed to make the best decisions for the well-being of our community in all its dimensions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When the University made the decision about remote learning for the remainder of the Spring 2020 semester because of the national public health emergency, our community had little time to prepare, and we have marveled at what we were able to achieve in that very short window. As we head into the summer months, our faculty will be thinking intensively about their courses to ensure we are ready for any scenario, and our staff members will continue reimagining how to offer valuable co-curricular opportunities that keep students engaged with one another and connected to our alumni network. Should any part of the next academic year need to be online, we will have spent months, not days, preparing for it. We are committed to providing every student with an exceptional St. Lawrence experience no matter the circumstances or mode of delivery, though we adamantly hope it is together in Canton.&nbsp;<a id="April-21" name="April-21"></a></p>
<p>As decisions are made in the weeks ahead, our students, their families, and our employees will be the first to know. We will also make sure the most up-to-date information can be easily found on the University’s COVID-19 website. We will move forward together, as Laurentians.</p>
<p>Thank you again for your support, your patience, and your commitment to St. Lawrence.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Hagi Bradley, Vice President and Dean of Student Life<br />

<h2>April 21 Message to Students, Parents, and Employees&nbsp;from Hagi Bradley, Vice President and Dean of Student Life, and Karl Schonberg, Vice President of the University and Dean of Academic Affairs</h2>
<p>Dear Laurentian Community,</p>
<p>We write to provide you with a recap and update on our ongoing response and planning during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p><strong>Recap</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Since early March, the University’s Senior Staff has been meeting daily and the University’s Emergency Planning Team has been meeting regularly to manage the crisis and ensure the safety and well-being of our campus community.</li>
<li>We have implemented remote learning through the end of the semester and created a new environment for learning and co-curricular opportunities in order to continue providing the St. Lawrence experience our students have come to know.&nbsp;</li>
<li>The Laurentian community remains incredibly strong and supportive. More than $100,000 has been raised to support the Student Emergency Assistance Fund.</li>
<li>At this time, St. Lawrence has reduced onsite staff to accommodate the 100 students remaining on campus in accordance with New York State directives.</li>
<li>The intention of the University is to replace the traditional May graduation for the Class of 2020 with another date on campus for an in-person Commencement once government and public health directives declare it is safe to do so and in coordination with the University calendar.&nbsp;</li>
<li>The University plans to provide refunds or credits for Spring 2020 room and board charges to students and will be able to calculate the amount that will be credited to a student's account after the end of the semester. By then, we will be able to speak to each situation specifically.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Planning for the Future</strong></p>
<p>There is a great deal of uncertainty in our society about how long the current stay-home directives will continue. The University has initiated a comprehensive planning process to ensure we continue to foster student learning, business continuity, and fiscal resiliency for the next academic year. Our hope is that we are able to return for the fall semester. We also recognize that we will be guided by national, state, and local government directives. This is why our initial framework for planning includes starting with the following four possible scenarios but allows for flexibility as needed.</p>
<ul>
<li>Return to campus as planned in August 2020 with some changes, but the academic calendar remains essentially intact; allowances to accommodate some online learning</li>
<li>Delayed start to the Fall 2020 semester with some coursework in the initial weeks being conducted remotely</li>
<li>Return to campus in January 2021 with online instruction in Fall 2020</li>
<li>Return to campus in Fall 2021 with online instruction throughout the 2020-21 academic year</li>
</ul>
<p>To begin exploring these contingencies, Senior Staff has established four planning groups of two to three senior staff members and additional faculty and staff to consider as fully as possible all implications for each scenario.</p>
<ul>
<li>Academic program and faculty; university calendar and events; off-campus programs</li>
<li>Non-academic programs—athletics, student life, campus capital assets</li>
<li>Administration—policies, contracts, staffing levels, and budget</li>
<li>Admissions, advancement, and long-term financial (revenue) strategy</li>
</ul>
<p>We all have more questions than answers for how the future will unfold. Many of you may wonder when we expect to decide about the fall, and our best answer is we don’t know yet. We acknowledge that time and resources for planning are important and ask for your patience as we consider the complexity of all factors. St. Lawrence faculty and staff have high standards for their teaching and program development and we encourage them to be thoughtful and flexible in curricular and co-curricular planning for next year. We are working with the best and latest information from multiple perspectives and want to reassure you that the safety and well-being of our campus community will be our unwavering priorities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We also want to share that there has been a significant impact to the University’s financial position as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Searches for open positions have been suspended effective March 20 for 60 days and will be reevaluated in May. The University’s investment portfolio was well-positioned to mitigate the impact of the market downturn but still experienced a loss in market value of about 10% as of the end of March. The Finance office has analyzed and projected cash and liquidity needs.</p>
<p><strong>Enhancements to St. Lawrence’s Remote Learning Experience</strong></p>
<p>No matter where Laurentians find themselves, compassion and support are the common threads that bind us together. During these last several weeks, departments across campus have reimagined how to best care for students in this moment of change and uncertainty. We wanted to highlight two of our newest offerings for students:</p>
<ul>
<li>Health and Counseling Services is extending its services by adding a 24-hour telephone crisis intervention and immediate counseling available for all St. Lawrence students. Students can call 315-229-1914 from anywhere in the world and speak with a licensed counselor any time of day or night, 365 days a year.</li>
<li>In addition to the many<a href="https://www.stlawu.edu/career-services/career-services-response-covid-19">&nbsp;remote career assistance and resources</a>&nbsp;that have been offered to students, St. Lawrence’s Career Services team has partnered with Parker Dewey to offer new opportunities for Micro-Internships, which are short-term, professional, paid work experiences that can be completed remotely. Interested students are encouraged to get started by creating an account at<a href="http://info.parkerdewey.com/stlawu">http://info.parkerdewey.com/stlawu</a>.&nbsp;<a id="April3" name="April3"></a></li>
</ul>
<p>We have both been so thankful for the support and care that our community has shown during the past eight weeks. Your voices will be vital in the weeks ahead and your ideas and perspectives will be invaluable and there will be many opportunities to offer them. &nbsp; We look forward to the day we can all hear again and in person the chapel bells ringing across campus.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Hagi Bradley, Vice President and Dean of Student Life<br />

<h2>April 3 Message to Faculty and Staff from Karl Schonberg, Vice President of the University and Dean of Academic Affairs</h2>
<p><a href="https://vimeo.com/403771546"><em>Watch Karl share his thoughts with&nbsp;faculty and staff here.</em></a></p>
<p>Faculty and Staff Colleagues,</p>
<p>I wanted to take a few moments just to share some reflections and hopes for the SLU community in this time of great challenge.&nbsp; Before doing that though, I want to ask something of all of you who hear this message.&nbsp; No matter what your circumstances, and whatever your role at the University, I want to ask that you take a few moments now to think of how, in the days ahead, you will take time to care for yourself, and I want to let you know how important this is to St. Lawrence.&nbsp; Our work is essential to each of us, but to do it well we need to be healthy and whole, in mind, body, and spirit.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The environment we are living in demands so much emotional energy, and we all want to do our best work, but in such a time it is easy in trying to honor our personal and professional commitments, to forget ourselves.&nbsp; So I want just to say how important it is to our community, that we each take the time we need to seek balance as best we can in our lives.&nbsp; To breathe.&nbsp; To disconnect.&nbsp; To do less.&nbsp; To forego perfection. To let go of the things that are not vital, to do what we can, but not try to do more.&nbsp; Because at the end of the day, our community can only be as strong as each of us are, not only now but far into the future.&nbsp; And the care and concern of each of us for every member of that community—including the care we must take for our own well-being--must be our highest value.</p>
<p>None of us have ever been through anything like this before, and though I believe we all know why the personal and professional sacrifices we are making now are crucial to the health of our community and loved ones, we all know too the very real costs.&nbsp; We have given up the ability to interact with our students in person in the ways that we value above all else at St. Lawrence.&nbsp; We continue to do all we can to help them learn, but we feel every day the limits on that capacity—of not being able to work together in our labs and studios and in the field, of the lost moments of connection in our classrooms, in our advising conversations, in the unexpected crossing of paths on campus that spark a conversation and a new idea.&nbsp; Our commitment to our students is undiminished, but we have lost so many of the ways in which it is normally expressed, and I think it’s important that we all take some time to reflect on that loss. Our students feel it profoundly too, and I would encourage us all to find the moments when we can talk with them about this.&nbsp; They need those opportunities, and we as their mentors need them too, and we all need to know that we are experiencing them together.</p>
<p>At the same time, even as we continue to pursue our work in our classes, we need to acknowledge the terrible context that events in our world have imposed on that work for all of us, as faculty, staff, and students alike.&nbsp; These realities impact us collectively, but also differentially based on our own circumstances.&nbsp; I know that all of us have talked with students who are confronting serious personal challenges of many different kinds.&nbsp; Their individual needs may vary greatly; some are struggling with their academic work in ways they never would have before; others need the structure and the significance of that work in their lives more than they may have realized.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I believe the best we can hope to do is to meet them each individually where they are.&nbsp; The University has temporarily changed its policies to allow students to request pass/fail grading or withdrawal without a grade until the end of the semester, and to remove other restrictions on pass/fail grades.&nbsp; Not all students will need or want these options, and as an institution we do not want to impose them.&nbsp; But for many students, knowing that they can consider them may help to relieve some of the stress they are feeling so much more acutely than they normally would.</p>
<p>Please know too that as profound as the challenges facing our students are, the University is fully committed to supporting them in every way we can.&nbsp; Our student life staff are reaching out to all students regularly to help them stay connected to St. Lawrence and each other, and to be sure that their concerns of all kinds are heard.&nbsp; Our advising office is fully engaged as well, and working intently to help students think about what they need right now and how to plan for the future.&nbsp; Our advising staff are resources for academic advisors as well, and are readily responding to questions from both faculty and students, as are Libraries and IT, along with all of our other campus offices, doing all they can to serve the St. Lawrence community.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition, a fund to support students facing financial concerns has been created, and is actively making awards to address student needs of all kinds.&nbsp; We know that students are confronting unprecedented challenges in many ways, and as their mentors I want you to know that there are many sources of help available to them.&nbsp; In all cases, if you know of a student needing help of any kind, large or small, please reach out to the dean’s office, the student life office, or the academic advising office and any of us can help to find them the support they need.</p>
<p>Some days ago, Dean Hagi Bradley and I wrote to our students and reminded them that the challenge of remote learning would bring uncertainty, and we asked them to recognize that this was felt by their professors just as it was by them.&nbsp; We said that at St. Lawrence, we value outstanding teaching and strong relationships between faculty and students above all else, and that as faculty we would continue to bring that deep commitment to our work with them in the weeks ahead.&nbsp; We asked that they return that commitment in kind, and recognize that their faculty would need their help, their patience, and their understanding of the challenges we all face together, just as that understanding would be offered to them.&nbsp; At this moment I could not be prouder of our community, because we can say to one another, as students, faculty, and staff engaged in that shared work of learning, we have kept that promise to each other.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Knowing that we have only just begun this work, I have been thinking in the last few days of a quote from another time of adversity, many years ago, when someone wiser than I said, “this is not the end, it is not even the beginning of the end.&nbsp; But perhaps, it is the end of the beginning.”&nbsp; Just a few weeks ago, few of us could have imagined the circumstances facing us now.&nbsp; But at the same time, few of us could have imagined the kind of changes we have been able to make in the ways we do our work, which we have undertaken with astonishing speed, skill, and success.&nbsp; We are only at the beginning, but in that beginning we have so very much to be deeply proud of.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is a long road ahead of us, which we will travel together united by the values of liberal education.&nbsp; As a community, I ask that we recognize now not only this shared purpose, but also the need along the way to care for each other, and to care for ourselves.&nbsp; We have a mission to help our students, but we can only do that when we remember to attend to our whole lives and not just our lives in our profession.&nbsp; To serve our students we must remember how daunting the challenges facing them, and facing us as teachers and as people, really are.&nbsp; And perhaps, to ask a little bit less of ourselves, to forgive the compromises we must all make to stay whole and be fully present in all the aspects of our lives which have been so disrupted, including but not limited to our classes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is a time for creativity and inspiration, and also for empathy and understanding for our students and ourselves, and for pragmatism about what we can do, and what we cannot.&nbsp; I believe if we hold to these principles we may look back on this time and know that we did the best and most honorable work of our lives.</p>
<p>Finally, I want to just say thank you.&nbsp; For all that you have done for our students and your colleagues.&nbsp; For all that you continue to do every day, and will do in the days ahead.&nbsp; For the care you take for your families, and the time you take for yourself.&nbsp; For not only what you have done but for the things you choose to put aside, that must be forgone however regretfully, in the name of doing the best we can, but not more.&nbsp; In this, please know that you have the profound gratitude and the support of St. Lawrence University in every way.&nbsp; We stand together, for our mission of liberal <a id="April2" name="April2"></a>education and for our community, as Laurentians.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Karl Schonberg<br />
Vice President of the University and Dean of Academic Affairs</p>
<h2>April 2 Message to Students from Hagi Bradley, Vice President and Dean of Student Life</h2>
<p>Hello Laurentian friends,</p>
<p>I am reaching out to you today, working from home, grateful to have been chosen to be your Vice President and Dean of Student Life. Interestingly enough, one year ago this month, I had my first interview with the search committee and President Fox. It’s a day that I remember so vividly. I knew immediately this place was truly something special and exactly the place I needed to be. I can sincerely say this was the best choice I could have ever made and this is now my home. Getting to know you, the students and the SLU community, has been a positive and life-changing experience, one I would never trade. I absolutely love being here and love working with you students. I want to give you all a “Hagi Hug” from afar. Please make sure to read all the way to the bottom of this message, I have included some important updates about commencement, the student assistance fund, health and counseling, career services, access to residence hall rooms, and summer programs.</p>
<p>We recognize that the quickly evolving and ever-changing COVID-19 pandemic has been a very challenging situation for all of you and your families and we sincerely hope that you are doing all that is necessary to stay safe. It’s very common for us to feel frightened by all the news at this moment in time. Always know that the entire St. Lawrence community is going through all this with you as we all face this difficult time together. Just like state and national officials, we are meeting daily to make decisions centered on the health and safety of all in our community. Updates can always be found at <a href="https://www.stlawu.edu/covid-19">https://www.stlawu.edu/covid-19</a>. I want to thank every student who has been so patient, understanding and gracious during the last few weeks. I know people are working from home, on video and conference calls. For those of us who work here, there are feelings of uneasiness working in a manner we've not worked in for an extended period of time. People are juggling work, kids, many times children's schoolwork or a partner working from home as well. The people of St. Lawrence are working, and identifying needs, and figuring out problems, and finding ways to complete our mission and to change the lives of our students so you can make a positive difference in the world. We seek to not only move forward with our educational mission but to do so in a meaningful, caring, compassionate, and student-centered manner. We are in this together because we care about each other. Let us all continue to pull together as a global community.</p>
<p>One of my favorite aspects of being at St. Lawrence has always been the ability to take a 10- or 15-minute walk as a break. This gift has been recognized for generations and you can find references from students, faculty and even presidents going back more than a century touting the benefits of a few minutes outdoors on our beautiful campus to clear your mind. I miss all of you and giving out “Hagi Hugs” as I inquire about your day and your lives. Your professors, staff, and administrators miss you. We all miss the excitement of daily life and chatting with each other in Dana, the hallways, and throughout the campus. In other words, we're thinking of you a lot.</p>
<p>Not everyone is in a situation, physically or geographically, to take such a walk. Take a moment, reach out to a fellow Laurentian, be it a friend, faculty, administrator, or staff member, and strengthen those special connections you’ve made here. Maybe one of us here might take you along for a virtual walk. You can even feel free to reach out to me and let me know your favorite place on campus. I’d love to schedule a time to walk there together as you tell me the locations you love most. I want your help to learn the ins and outs of this truly inspiring place and what you appreciate about it. Please consider it. You'd be doing us a favor if you do. Because getting outside of ourselves is just as important as getting outside for a walk. Let’s experience this together.</p>
<p>In times like this, it's more important than ever to remember why we all chose this extraordinary place, to be a Laurentian for Life. Take a moment to think of those experiences that are so special and will forever be a part of who you are. Great stories bring us together. For you the Class of 2020, I am truly sorry that your lives have been turned upside down. I ask a special task of you. You all already received a message from me about my thoughts on this semester. I now ask you for something very specific. Campus and student lore holds a special place in my heart. I have heard so many wonderful stories about your time here at St. Lawrence. I now ask that you put those traditions and knowledge of your time here into words so that it may be shared with fellow Laurentians and those coming behind you. Write about your experiences and what you love most about this place. I want to share some of these on a weekly basis to help remind us how special a place we all share. In this unusual time when we are encouraged not to touch one another physically, let's not lose touch with one another as a loving St. Lawrence community.</p>
<p>Some years ago a movement arose in the country and in the world called Random Acts of Kindness. The idea is to be intentional in being kind, in doing small things with great love, day by day. What would it look like for you to be kind to yourself today in the midst of this stressful time? What Random Act of Kindness can you do to lift your spirits and the spirits of others today? I encourage all of you to connect with me and with each other. Tell me how things are going and what you are doing to stay positive. Share free resources that you’ve found out there that are helpful. For me, I have started meditation. I found the website <a href="https://www.meditainment.com/">https://www.meditainment.com/</a> and during this time, they are giving away free twenty-minute meditations on different topics. I’ve found them to be so helpful during this stressful time. I challenge all of you to take a minimum of thirty minutes each day to do an act of kindness for yourself. Take the time to connect with something larger than yourself this week, this moment in time. I look forward to sharing your encouraging words and stories.</p>
<p>If there are other questions or if you just want to chat, please know I am here for you. Know that you are resilient and smart, and know that we care about you. When you are struggling, reach out to someone in our community. Starting Tuesday, April 7, I will hold drop-in hours over Zoom (<a href="https://stlawu.zoom.us/j/7926113529">https://stlawu.zoom.us/j/7926113529</a>) every Tuesday and Thursday from 4-6 pm until finals (*please note that April 21, 28, &amp; May 5 it will be from 6-7:30 pm). If these times don’t work, please let me know and I’d love to find time to talk with you. We will make it through this together as a community, as a family. Know that we genuinely care about you, our Laurentians for Life. Take care of yourselves and your loved ones. I also want to wish you the best in the remainder of the semester. We will see you here again soon!</p>
<p>With warmest regards,</p>
<p>Hagi</p>
<p><strong>IMPORTANT INFORMATION</strong></p>
<p><strong>Commencement Update</strong></p>
<p>The intention of the University is to replace the traditional May Commencement for the Class of 2020 with another date on campus in a traditional academic ceremony with stage, speeches, and regalia, once government and public health directives declare it is safe to do so and in coordination with the University calendar. We expect more information will be provided, including a tentative date, within the next few weeks. This (TBD) face-to-face event will be livestreamed, as has been the custom at past Commencements, but there will not be a remote or virtual celebration on Sunday, May 17 as was previously offered.</p>

<p><strong>Campus Housing Possessions</strong></p>
<p>We understand our residents are experiencing significant disruption in their personal and academic lives. Due to the New York State Governor’s March 20 directive for 100% work-on-site reduction, we cannot grant access and arrange for students to retrieve their belongings at this time, nor may we assist with packing and shipping. Please do NOT return to campus to pick up your belongings until you hear from us. We continue to work on how students will all get their belongings. Please know your belongings are safely locked in your room and we will keep your stuff safe as we figure out the process. We are looking at all possible options and we will be in touch once State and Public Health officials have deemed it safe.</p>
<p><strong>Summer Programs Update</strong><br />
Due to the uncertainty of the rapidly changing COVID-19 situation and the need for longer-term planning for a number of summer programs we wanted to provide you with these decision updates:</p>
<ul>
<li>On-campus components of summer academic programs including coursework, SLUPIC, SLU and Tanner Fellowships, CSTEP and McNair summer research and internships, HEOP Summer session, and Saints Start Challenge Grants are canceled. Program directors will work with mentors, fellowship awardees, and Tanner applicants to see if remote options or postponements of projects are possible.</li>
<li>We expect to maintain our summer online course offerings.&nbsp;</li>
<li>All on- and off-campus events and gatherings are suspended through July 5 pending future notice.</li>
<li>Residential and Dining facilities will be closed through July 5 pending future notice with the exception of students approved to stay on campus through an individual request process.&nbsp;<a id="March-26" name="March-26"></a></li>
<li>All spring semester international short-term travel components, summer international internships, and summer international travel courses are cancelled.</li>
<li>Camp Canaras, located on Upper Saranac Lake and operated by the University, will be closed for the 2020 season.</li>
</ul>
<p>We will share evolving decisions and plans before July 5 for the remaining summer months.</p>
<h2>Important Update from President Fox: Thursday, March 26, 12 p.m.</h2>
<p>Dear Laurentian Friends,</p>
<p>I write to inform you that an employee&nbsp;notified the University today that they have a confirmed case of COVID-19.</p>
<ul>
<li>To respect the privacy of the individual, they will remain anonymous.</li>
<li>This individual will remain quarantined by the St. Lawrence County Public Health Department until their officials have cleared the individual.</li>
<li>The individual did not live on campus and has been off campus since Monday, March 16, 2020.</li>
<li>The St. Lawrence County Public Health Department will notify students, faculty, and staff who may have been exposed.</li>
<li>Those notified should contact their primary care physician for guidance.</li>
<li>All other members of the community should continue to abide by <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/about/prevention.html?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fcoronavirus%2F2019-ncov%2Fabout%2Fprevention-treatment.html">social distancing</a> and other<a href="https://www.stlawu.edu/covid-19/preventative-measures"> preventative measures</a>.</li>
<li>Affected physical spaces will receive deep cleaning consistent with public health guidelines.</li>
</ul>
<p>Appropriate precautions are being taken to keep the students who are staying on campus and the essential employees working on-site safe. The University’s Emergency Planning Team continues to meet regularly and address matters related to academic affairs, student life, international programs, and infrastructure. We will continue to send regular updates on Monday, Wednesdays, and Fridays as well as keep the University’s<a href="https://www.stlawu.edu/covid-19"> COVID-19</a> website updated.</p>
<p>It is important to remember to exercise caution regarding the information you may see on social media. The St. Lawrence County Public Health Department, in conjunction with the New York State Department of Health, provides the only official quarantine&nbsp;measures for COVID-19.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We are in extremely rare times not only for St. Lawrence, but in higher education, and our nation. The situation is complex as anxiety is high, and the future is uncertain. I want to reassure you our top concern continues to be the safety and well-being of our campus community and striving that our students can complete their coursework without interruption. Our work is done always with the best interest in mind of our university, our students, our employees, and all who care about the institution.&nbsp;<a id="March-24" name="March-24"></a></p>
<p>I have been inspired by the spirit demonstrated by our Laurentian community during recent days and weeks. That spirit can be felt throughout the North Country, also in every Laurentian heart and prayer.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Bill Fox</p>

<p>Dear Laurentian Friends,</p>
<p>There are many messages a University president must deliver, yet today’s is among the most forbidding and personally wrenching in my eleven years at St. Lawrence.</p>
<p>Since St. Lawrence’s founding 164 years ago, Laurentians have looked forward to the cadence of our treasured traditions each academic year. This global pandemic has upended many plans and forced us to make tough decisions that ensure the health and safety of our community. This is a promise we make to each student and family every day, and it’s a promise that has guided us in every difficult moment during this unfamiliar pattern of days.</p>
<p>Late last week, New York State Governor Cuomo directed that all employers comply with 100% work-on-site reduction with defined exceptions for essential business functions. With this mandate and in an effort to provide as much time for students and families to plan for the remainder of the spring semester, we have decided not to wait until April 6. We are announcing several major decisions now. This information is posted on the University’s<a href="https://www.stlawu.edu/covid-19"> COVID-19 website</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Remote Learning: </strong>We will continue with remote learning through the end of the semester, so students can complete coursework from off campus. Our faculty, Information Technology team, and other staff members have done significant work in a short amount of time creating a new environment for learning. Their efforts have been laudable and I also want to thank our students for their quick adaptation to the new normal.<br />
	&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Commencement:</strong> We have decided to postpone the in-person Commencement celebrations scheduled for Sunday, May 17, 2020, and to schedule a live streamed event that day to honor the Class of 2020 on the day you planned to join the Laurentian alumni community. To each member of the Class of 2020: This is the least desirable outcome that any of us wanted, and we all share in your immense disappointment, and even your tears. There are now teams of people who will spend an incredible amount of time in the coming days and weeks reimagining the ways we can celebrate you and your numerous accomplishments appropriately and safely.
<ul>
<li>More details on the virtual celebration for May will be coming soon.&nbsp;</li>
<li>We will definitely find a time to invite you back to Canton to give cheer in person, and those plans will be shared at some point in the future.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Room and Board Credits/Refunds:</strong> Many students and parents have inquired about University policy concerning partial refunds or credits related to room and board, given the transition to online instruction for the remainder of the spring semester. These are unprecedented times, and we have focused our initial energy on student/faculty/staff safety and academic continuity.
<p>	Due in large part to variances in financial aid awards, each family's situation is different, so there is not a one-size-fits-all answer. The University plans to provide refunds or credits for room and board charges, but will only be able to calculate the amount that will be credited to a student's account after the end of the semester. By then, we will be able to speak to each situation specifically. I appreciate your patience as we work through this process.<br />
	&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Retrieving Belongings: </strong>The effect of the New York State Governor’s directive is that we cannot grant access and arrange for students to retrieve their belongings at this time, nor may we assist with packing and shipping. We know how important the items that you left behind are to you, but we don’t know how long this directive will remain in effect. We are developing a plan and we will be back in touch with you once we have additional information.<br />
	&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Students Currently on Campus: </strong>Students still on campus have the choice to remain on campus for the duration of the Spring 2020 semester or return to their homes. There will be an individual request process to stay on campus longer for those students who are not able to return home this summer.<br />
	&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Emergency Student Assistance Fund</strong>: Recognizing the financial hardship that is now being faced by many of our students, the University, with the <a href="https://www.givecampus.com/schools/StLawrenceUniversity/emergency-student-assistance-fund#updates">support of generous donors</a>, has established the Emergency Student Assistance Fund, which will help students with uncovered and unplanned expenses. For more information about applying to use the fund, please visit <a href="https://www.stlawu.edu/covid-19/form/covid-19-emergency-student-assistance-fund">https://www.stlawu.edu/covid-19/form/covid-19-emergency-student-assistance-fund</a>.<br />
	&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Reunion: </strong>Reunion Weekend, scheduled for May 28-31, 2020, has been cancelled. We will work to develop a plan to celebrate with our affinity and Reunion milestone classes at a later date.<br />
	&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Laurentian Events:</strong> All on- and off-campus events are cancelled through June 1. This includes our upcoming Admitted Student Open Houses in April, our spring Admissions Visit Day on April 27, and the upcoming SLU Connect-Boston event, scheduled for May.&nbsp;<br />
	&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>International Summer Programs: </strong>All spring semester international short-term travel components, summer international internships, and summer international travel courses are cancelled.<br />
	&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Other Summer Programs:</strong> We expect to maintain our summer online course offerings. We are in the process of evaluating other summer programs and will provide more details by April 1.&nbsp;<a id="March-20" name="March-20"></a></li>
</ul>
<p>Even in times of personal sorrow, Laurentians persevere, show compassion, and support one another, as these are the common threads that bind up the bundle of our community. In this historic moment, St. Lawrence needs you to be the best Laurentian you can be. And so will your family, friends, neighbors, and the world.</p>
<p>With abiding hope, always,</p>
<p>Bill Fox<br />
President</p>

<p>Dear Students,</p>
<p>We wanted to write to you today as you prepare to begin your coursework in the coming weeks through remote learning, with a few reflections, some advice, and a request for your help.</p>
<p>First, if you have not yet seen it we wanted to recommend to you <a href="https://www.stlawu.edu/covid-19/coronavirus-updates#March-18">President Fox’s statement</a> to the campus community earlier this week.&nbsp; It captures what many of us are feeling.&nbsp; We love the St. Lawrence campus, our friends and mentors, and the patterns of our lives here.&nbsp; These things have been taken from us, and there is no denying the tragedy in that fact.&nbsp; We feel it daily in the distance that separates us; it is, as President Fox says, the “utter heartbreak about being ripped away from college life, as if by an immeasurable natural force, abruptly departing from a place so deeply cherished.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>We are all feeling this absence, and we all need to share in our grief over this loss, to help one another.&nbsp; We want you to know that every member of the St. Lawrence community, your professors along with staff and students, feels this more deeply than we can say.&nbsp; We are struggling too with the uncertainties of the world around us, and it is important to recognize that we all are experiencing these feelings together as well.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The challenge of undertaking classes remotely in the coming days brings its own sense of uncertainty, and as students we ask you to recognize that this is felt by your professors just as it is by you.&nbsp; At St. Lawrence we value outstanding teaching and strong relationships between faculty and students above all else, and we promise you that your professors will continue to bring that deep commitment to their work with you in the weeks ahead.&nbsp; We ask that you return that commitment in kind, and recognize that they will need your help, your patience, and your understanding of the challenges we all face together, just as they will offer that understanding to you.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This experience which none of us wished for is new for all of us, and we will need to help one another navigate it day by day, with flexibility, empathy, and good humor along the way.&nbsp; In doing that though, we can make this moment not merely one in which we find a pathway through a time of uncertainty.&nbsp; Instead we can look back to say that it was our <em>best </em>moment, because in adversity we found strength in one another, and a deeper meaning in the bonds of our community.&nbsp; We will help each other to learn in ways we cannot yet imagine, and in the future we will know that when confronted with our most profound challenges, we faced and overcame them together, as Laurentians.</p>
<p>There will be many questions and challenges to address in the coming days, but today we wanted to offer this as our wish for you and our community.&nbsp; We each have a part to play, needs we must express to one another and help we can give.&nbsp; We offer our promise to you, on behalf of St. Lawrence, that we will do this work together.&nbsp;<a id="March-18" name="March-18"></a><a id="March-20" name="March-20"></a></p>

    <div class="field field-name-field-paragraph-text field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item even"><p>Dear Laurentian friends,</p>
<p>All the practical advice about personal precautions and community behavior will settle soon into a repetitious habit as the world faces up to a dangerous moment. Pandemics in history have never been exclusionary, making no exceptions in their effects upon city or countryside. One hundred years ago, our campus was infected by pandemic influenza and all students survived, but the worst of it was in the Canton community when high numbers of farm families and mill workers died.</p>
<p>My intention is not to bring news to you in this letter. St. Lawrence University will continue to post specific messages about the mechanics and the calendar of the spring semester. Additional information is promised as we learn more and more each day, as we develop our best responses, and decide on the most desirable probabilities in adapting our plans to be a community of experience and learning by other means. When we begin remote learning and distant working protocols, it will be trial and error. Education gets messy, ask any senior professor, so count on degrees of imperfection as we do our best to make matters mostly positive.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, I wish to pause for the purpose of acknowledging and reflecting on the sudden and deep feelings among us about the cascade of disorderly events, very personal in all cases. I have heard from students individually, and in unison, a voice crying utter heartbreak about being ripped away from college life, as if by an immeasurable natural force, abruptly departing from a place so deeply cherished.</p>
<p>To students: the campus, its landmarks, and all its inhabitants have become your mental and social reference point in a short amount of time. Nevertheless, it can, must, and will become a vital presence in this next chapter of your life, ever unchanged in your “fondest memory.” For seniors, the sentimental journey of the final semester was all on track when we began in January. Your lifelong friendships were only going to be more enriched by the coming weeks together. Your class will unknowably and somehow be different from those recent classes that preceded you.</p>
<p>The singers, dancers, actors, organizers, and athletes among us worked incredibly hard to prepare for performances, activities, and competitions. I am mad, too, about seasons being cancelled. I love watching you achieve excellence, doing very difficult things extremely well, particularly as teams and ensembles. But there is nowhere to place blame, really. And there is no percentage (yes, I’m still competitive and can do splits in my head) in staying mad. For your parents, I am fully confident, as a parent myself, about the incalculable loss they feel in missing the experience of being your cheerleaders, your gallery, your audience at all the weekend games, races, or concerts we had all anticipated with an almost sublime pleasure.</p>
<p>Two hundred St. Lawrence students were selectively placed all over the world this semester in their course work and touring. Unfortunately, when the United States Peace Corps (where St. Lawrence earns best-in-the-nation renown) brings home its volunteers, we have warrant to follow. It will be more than jet lag they will experience in their return. There is understandable sadness about missing what might have been, about deferring uncertain opportunities.</p>
<p>I know faculty members had planned extraordinary field trips and practicums this spring with all the delight of being “renewed” students again themselves. That’s the passion and joy of teaching, of returning to the kick of discovery. And then, within days, a flash, the syllabus is busted. These developments leave all of us in a state of unnamed dismay. All of us.</p>
<p>The campus, at the moment, is absolutely still. The shadows remain long at dusk and dawn, east and west. The chanticleer of the chapel spire casting a recognizable silhouette nearly reaches the stone work of Kirk Douglas Hall at evening; at dawn it practically touches the windows of ODY Library. There are students in residence here whose family homes are in other time zones and lands. They have worries about loved ones that are also intense, not easily relieved or distracted by the familiar, quiet, slower patterns of a recess. They need a reassuring word from the rest of us that Laurentians look out for each other. A word from American parents and well-travelled alumni would be welcome, too.</p>
<p>When John Adams and Thomas Jefferson resumed their friendship after years of mutual disdain, maybe each kept in pocket an ounce of grudging respect, they did so remotely. Their correspondence is a trove of wisdom and insight for the capacity to evolve, think differently, and adapt to changed realities. Adams wrote one day, revealing to Jefferson the personal effects of missing members of his family’s second generation. Our sons and daughters “cost us grief, anxiety, often vexation, and sometimes humiliation.” Then he rushes to finish the more important thought, that it is always “cheering to have them hovering about us. And I verily believe they have contributed largely to keep us alive.”</p>
<p>Our students, even when they are not everyone on campus, all 2,400 of them, will keep us alive. They will drive the show; they will show us the way. It may be a distant day, but it will come again when they are “hovering about us.” Their dreams, theirs loves, their hopes are, for now, safe beneath the shadows cast upon the beloved Quad. Let’s stay close. St. Lawrence’s genius is in knowing how to do that and mean something by it.<a id="March-10" name="March-10"></a></p>

<h2>Campus Message from the President: Tuesday, March 10, 7:15&nbsp;p.m.</h2>
<p>Dear Laurentian Friends,</p>
<p>The COVID-19 virus has continued to spread, and many parts of the United States and the world have been impacted. I would like to reinforce that to best protect the health and well-being of our campus community, we need to focus on mitigating its possible effects. <strong>At this writing, March 10, 2020, no St. Lawrence University student&nbsp;or community member&nbsp;has been confirmed to have contracted COVID-19.</strong></p>
<p>We realize that many people will be traveling during the upcoming Spring Break. &nbsp;Our nation’s goal at this moment is mitigation, and we believe the threat to our rural campus community when hundreds of people return from break is far too great to continue a traditional semester plan. &nbsp;We are required to act now to slow the spread of COVID-19. Below are the major decisions that the University has made with additional information that follows.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>St. Lawrence University will move to remote learning after Spring Break, beginning Monday, March 23</strong>, so students can complete coursework as much as possible from off campus.</li>
<li><strong>As of now, on-campus classes are planned to resume on Monday, April 13.</strong> We will continue to assess the situation and provide clear guidance by Monday, April 6, about returning to campus.</li>
<li><strong>All University-sponsored Spring Break travel, including international, domestic, and athletics trips, has been canceled</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Both on- and off-campus athletic competitions are suspended until Monday, April 13. </strong></li>
<li><strong>All students are expected to leave campus by Saturday, March 14, at 5 p.m.</strong>&nbsp;Only those students who have been approved by the Office of Residence Life to remain on campus over Spring Break will be allowed to stay on campus for the remote learning portion of the semester.</li>
<li><strong>Campus will remain open and fully operational, and all faculty and staff should continue their regular work schedules. </strong>As the situation develops, employees who are able to work remotely may request approval to do so from their supervisor until classes resume on Monday, April 13.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Additional Information:</strong></p>
<p><strong>How do I apply for permission to stay on campus through Spring Break and until April 13?&nbsp;</strong><br />
We understand that for a limited number of students, going to or staying at a location away from campus is not possible. For that reason, students may contact the Office of Residence Life to apply to stay on campus during Spring Break and through April 13. The deadline for submitting a request is 5:00 p.m. this Wednesday, March 11, and students will be notified of the University’s decision by Thursday, March 12.</p>
<p><strong>What should I take home with me?</strong><br />
We strongly recommend that students take with them all books, other course materials, and any essential personal items they may need for the remainder of the semester. While we plan to start in-person coursework again on April 13, the situation is evolving and subject to change. Students who are not approved to stay will not be permitted to return to the residence halls once residence halls close on Saturday, March 14.</p>
<p><strong>Will the University be closed through April 13?</strong><br />
Our campus will continue to operate during this period.&nbsp;Continuing to educate our students and providing a safe environment for those who remain in residence will continue without interruption. Faculty and staff are expected to continue with their work. As the situation develops, employees who are able to work remotely may request approval to do so from their supervisor until classes resume on Monday, April 13.</p>
<p>Individual events scheduled to be held on campus will be evaluated and updates will be provided as soon as possible.</p>
<p><strong>What support is available for the community about remote instruction?</strong><br />
More information will be coming shortly regarding training and resources for individual faculty to support remote instruction. Some information for faculty <a href="https://stlawu.teamdynamix.com/TDClient/1805/ortal/KB/ArticleDet?ID=100377">can be found here.</a></p>
<p><strong>What about University-sponsored domestic business travel?</strong><br />
University-sponsored domestic (United States) business travels may be restricted as different areas of our nation are affected over the next weeks. Travel plans to conferences or other purposes should be communicated to the respective senior staff member as soon as possible and senior staff will advise if such travel must be cancelled or postponed.</p>
<p><strong>Will advising and course registration continue as planned?</strong><br />
Yes, the advising period of March 24-April 3 and class registration for Fall 2020 courses April 6-10 will take place remotely as scheduled.&nbsp; We ask advisors and students to prepare their devices for advising and registration before leaving campus for Spring Break.</p>
<p><strong>What is the status of our international study programs?</strong><br />
With the exception of Italy and Japan, our international programs are operating, and the Student Safe Travel Committee will continue to carefully assess the situation in each off-campus location.</p>
<p><strong>Where can I get more information or ask additional questions?&nbsp;</strong><br />
Please check your email and the University’s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.stlawu.edu/covid-19">COVID-19 website&nbsp;</a>for updates and more information.</p>
<p>Our top concern continues to be the safety and well-being of our campus community and ensuring that our students can complete their coursework without interruption. I know that these decisions have a significant impact on everyone. We make this decision out of an abundance of caution and to mitigate the spread of the COVID-19. I know many of you share in my disappointment of the need to make this decision. We strive to make decisions in the best interest of our entire campus community, using the best public health information at our disposal, and with a sense of empathy that is a hallmark of the Laurentian spirit.&nbsp;<a id="March-9" name="March-9"></a></p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Bill Fox<br />
President</p>
<h2>Campus update: Monday, March 9, 4:30 p.m.</h2>
<p>Dear Members of the St. Lawrence Community,</p>
<p>We write with updated information regarding the University’s response to COVID-19 (novel Coronavirus).</p>
<p>The health and safety of our campus community is our top concern, and we are monitoring updates from state, federal, and international health organizations daily.&nbsp;Members of the Emergency Planning Team are meeting daily to ensure coordination of information.</p>
<p>Despite rumors: <strong>At this writing, March 9, 2020, no St. Lawrence University student&nbsp;or community member&nbsp;has been confirmed to have contracted COVID-19.</strong> According to the CDC, a novel coronavirus is a new coronavirus that has not been previously identified. <strong>The virus causing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is not the same as the common coronaviruses that regularly circulate among humans and cause mild illness,</strong> like the common cold.</p>
<p>While New York State Governor Andrew Cuomo has declared a State of Emergency for the purposes of expediting community access to resources, the New York State Department of Health has said no one in St. Lawrence County has been diagnosed.</p>
<p>Below are our most recent updates, many based on questions we’ve received from community members.</p>
<p><strong>Health and Counseling Services</strong></p>
<p>Effective Tuesday, March 10, 2020, the Diana B. Torrey ’82 Health and Counseling Center will shift from having walk-in hours to a call-in center for ALL medical and counseling needs due to the developing COVID-19 situation and continuing flu season. Should you begin to experience symptoms including cough, fever (100.4), and difficulty breathing you should call the Center at (315) 229-5392. &nbsp;If you experience these symptoms at a time that the Center is not open, we ask that you contact Safety and Security at (315) 229-5555.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>University-sponsored Domestic Spring Break Travel</strong></p>
<p>As of March 8, 2020, following review by the Student Safe Travel Committee and advice from public health officials in San Francisco, California, the University has cancelled planned trips by the Laurentian Singers and SLU Connect to San Francisco.&nbsp; University-sponsored Spring Break trips within the United States, including athletics, are planned to continue as scheduled. The Student Safe Travel Committee will&nbsp;continue to carefully assess the situation and updates will be provided if needed.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Upcoming Personal Travel</strong></p>
<p>With the increased likelihood of quarantine upon return to the United States, the University advises that students as well as faculty and staff do not travel internationally (including Canada) for the foreseeable future, including during the upcoming Spring Break, and that they continue to monitor if their destinations within the United States are being affected by COVID-19. &nbsp;Students who are directed to quarantine by the U.S. Government after traveling internationally will not be able to return to campus until the quarantine timeline has been reached, which may put their academic progress at risk.</p>
<p>Any person who has been in a Level 3 area within 14 days must notify Health &amp; Counseling Services before returning to St. Lawrence University, and may be required to observe the 14-day quarantine recommended by the New York State Department of Health prior to returning.</p>
<p>The University strongly advises against independent travel by students, faculty, and staff to regions of the United States which are currently experiencing major outbreaks. At this time, these areas include Washington State and the San Francisco region of California.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Returning to Campus after Spring Break</strong></p>
<p>We plan to conduct all classes in-person and all University offices will remain open. In addition, we are discussing a number of actions as warranted by changing guidance and conditions. As planned, residence halls will reopen at 8 a.m. on Sunday, March 22, 2020, and classes will resume after Spring Break on Monday, March 23.</p>
<p>Out of an abundance of caution, we strongly recommend that all students traveling over break take with them all books, other course materials, and any essential personal items they may need for the remainder of the semester, in case they encounter any difficulties in returning to campus for any reason.</p>
<p>Students whose travel plans change due to concerns about public health issues may contact the Office of Residence Life to apply to stay on campus during spring break.</p>
<p><strong>Important Information (shared in previous communications)</strong></p>
<p><strong>University-sponsored International Spring Break Travel</strong></p>
<p>The University has decided to cancel all University-sponsored international trips during the upcoming Spring Break. The decision was made after careful consideration and discussion with the Student Safe Travel Committee offering wisdom to the University’s senior staff. The situation is evolving but our understanding is that some travelers to the United States from abroad are likely to be quarantined at this point. It is important to understand that the decision to quarantine or to test for COVID-19 is at the discretion of the U.S. Government for individuals returning to the United States from abroad.</p>
<p><strong>International Programs</strong><br />
The Center for International and Intercultural Studies is in contact with directors of St. Lawrence University off-campus programs, the directors of our partner programs, and with the students and their families enrolled in our Spring international study program.&nbsp; The University has cancelled its spring off-campus programs in Italy and students on those programs are completing their coursework remotely.&nbsp; With this exception, our off-campus programs are operating and taking account of all appropriate health and safety advice in their regions, and we will continue to carefully assess the situation in each off-campus location.</p>
<p><strong>Employee Travel and Telemedicine Information&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>For faculty and staff who have made plans to travel to conferences in the next few months: If the conference is cancelled due to an emergency situation (such as COVID-19 concerns) by the organizers or you wish to cancel your conference travel for those reasons, please work with the conference organizers, airlines, hotels etc. to be reimbursed for any expenses already incurred. As per our policy, any unreimbursed expenses will be charged to the university up to the limit of your annual travel budget.</p>
<p>For employees enrolled in a University-sponsored health insurance plan, you may visit a board-certified doctor by video conference (smartphone, tablet or computer) or phone right from home, or while traveling, for non-emergency medical conditions, including respiratory infections.&nbsp; Telemedicine benefits are available 24/7/365.Participants may set up a telemedicine visit by visiting the Excellus website at&nbsp;<a href="http://www.excellusbcbs.com">www.excellusbcbs.com</a>&nbsp;and registering for MDLive.&nbsp; More details available from&nbsp;<a href="https://www.stlawu.edu/human-resources/employee-benefits">Human Resources</a>.</p>

<h2>Campus update: novel Coronavirus Wed, March 4</h2>
<p>Dear Laurentian Community,<br />
&nbsp;<br />
We write with updated information regarding the University’s response to the COVID-19 (novel Coronavirus). &nbsp;At this writing, March 4, 2020, no St. Lawrence University student has been confirmed to have contracted the novel Coronavirus, and according to the New York State Department of Health, no one has been diagnosed with it in St. Lawrence County.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Below are our most recent updates, many based on questions we’ve received from community members.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong>University-sponsored International Spring Break Travel</strong><br />
The University has decided to cancel all University-sponsored international trips during the upcoming Spring Break. The decision was made after careful consideration and discussion with the Student Safe Travel Committee offering wisdom to the University’s senior staff. The situation is evolving but our understanding is that some travelers to the United States from abroad are likely to be quarantined at this point. It is important to understand that the decision to quarantine or to test for the coronavirus is at the discretion of the U.S. Government for individuals returning to the United States from abroad.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong>University-sponsored Domestic Spring Break Travel</strong><br />
As of March 4, 2020, University-sponsored Spring Break trips within the United States, including athletics, will continue as scheduled. The Student Safe Travel Committee will continue to carefully assess the situation and updates will be provided if needed.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong>Personal Travel During Spring Break</strong><br />
With the increased likelihood of quarantine upon return to the United States, the University advises that students as well as faculty and staff do not travel internationally during the upcoming Spring Break. Students who are directed to quarantine by the U.S. Government after traveling internationally will not be able to return to campus until the quarantine timeline has been reached, which will put their academic progress at risk.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong>Italy Programs</strong><br />
We are committed to working with our students who had been studying in Italy to allow completion of their academic work from their homes, with the goal that they will receive full credit for the semester and no progress toward graduation will be lost.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Information is evolving but it is our understanding that travelers to the United States from abroad, including Italy, are likely being quarantined in their homes.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
We do not have housing or course registration at St. Lawrence for students unexpectedly returning from abroad. Those students are not covered by St. Lawrence insurance for University-sponsored activities. &nbsp;As a result, they may not return to campus in Canton nor participate in local University-sponsored activities this semester, and this includes Titus Weekend. &nbsp;This decision is in the best interest of the health of our returning students as well as our campus community, whose safety and welfare is our responsibility.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong>International Programs</strong><br />
The Center for International and Intercultural Studies is in contact with directors of St. Lawrence University off-campus programs, the directors of our partner programs, and with the students and their families enrolled in our Spring international study program. With the exception now of Italy, our international programs are operating, and we will continue to carefully assess the situation in each off-campus location.<br />
&nbsp;<br />

<h2>Saturday, Feb. 29, 2020 - Email to Campus Community</h2>
<p>Dear Laurentian Community:<br />
&nbsp;<br />
We write with updated information regarding the University’s response to the COVID-19 (novel Coronavirus). &nbsp;At this writing, February 29, 2020, no St. Lawrence University student has been confirmed to have contracted the novel Coronavirus, and according to the New York State Department of Health, no one has been diagnosed with it in New York State.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong>Italy Programs</strong><br />
Last evening, the State Department Travel Advisory for Italy was raised to a level 3, urging U.S. citizens to "reconsider travel." &nbsp;St. Lawrence has 15 students studying in three locations in Italy, Cortona, Sorrento, and Rome. The Cortona Program administration has cancelled the balance of semester and students are being assisted in their travel home. The University has advised that students&nbsp;in Sorrento and Rome also return to their homes in the United States. All 15 students will be able to complete their academic coursework virtually, so no loss of academic progress should be experienced.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
The health and safety of our students is our top concern, and we are monitoring updates from state, federal, and international health organizations daily. The risk to our campus community at this point is minimal; however, this could change quickly if the number of reported cases in the United States continues to rise.</p>
<p><strong>Emergency Planning Team</strong><br />
The University has an Emergency Planning Team that created and is updating internal guidelines in the event the World Health Organization declares this event a pandemic. &nbsp;Members of the Emergency Planning Team have worked online and in small subgroups for the past 10 days and will continue to meet often for the rest of the semester to refine plans, create communications, and advise the President. &nbsp;Staff in our Torrey Health and Counseling Center continue to monitor county, state and federal recommendations related to COVID-19.</p>
<p><strong>Travel Advisory</strong><br />
We advise that, in accordance with U.S. Department of State and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommendations, Laurentian community members should carefully monitor travel advisories prior to and during any international travel, including travel for the upcoming spring break. This is especially important as other countries, or other areas of the United States, affected by COVID-19 could implement their own travel restrictions, which are subject to change without notice and have the potential to impede return travel to Canton.</p>
<p><strong>Other International Programs</strong><br />
The Center for International and Intercultural Studies is in contact with directors of St. Lawrence University off-campus programs as well as the directors of our partner programs and with the 188 students and their families enrolled in our Spring international study program. With the exception now of Italy, our international programs are operating, and we will continue to carefully assess the situation in each off-campus location. In consultation with the Student Safe Travel Committee, CIIS staff will make recommendations to the University Senior Staff about the wisdom of continuing other St. Lawrence off-campus trips, especially those planned for Spring Break, and will communicate directly with faculty leaders and student participants.</p>
<p><strong>Information Resources</strong><br />
The CDC has established a COVID-19 website with comprehensive information about reducing the risk of infection, advice related to international travel, and what to do if you think you may be sick. St. Lawrence has established its own informational website where updates will be posted as they are communicated to our community. <a href="https://www.stlawu.edu/covid-19/coronavirus-updates">https://www.stlawu.edu/covid-19/coronavirus-updates</a><br />
&nbsp;<br />
We urge you to continue to follow these preventative hygiene practices including:<br />
Wash your hands often and carefully with soap and water for at least 20 seconds.<br />
Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands.<br />
Avoid close contact with people who are sick AND do not go out in public when you are sick.<br />
Cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue.<br />
Use disinfectant wipes to clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Students who are experiencing flu-like symptoms should contact the Health Center immediately at (315) 229-5392 or Safety and Security during off-hours at (315) 229-5555.</p>
<p>We understand the unsettling nature that news of an emerging illness can bring. At the same time, we want to reassure our campus community that the University and our campus health professionals are committed to monitoring developments related to the novel Coronavirus.</p>
<p><a id="Feb-26" name="Feb-26"></a>We will continue to provide updates as needed to our community to ensure that you have the information and resources you need to stay healthy and safe. &nbsp;Please do not hesitate to contact the Campus Health Center at any time with questions or concerns.</p>

<h2>Wednesday, Feb. 26, 2020 - Email to Campus Community &nbsp;</h2>
