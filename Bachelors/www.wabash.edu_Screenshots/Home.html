<p>The staff of the Wabash Student Health Center &ndash; Scott Douglas, M.D. &lsquo;84 (Montgomery County Health Officer), John Roberts, M.D. &rsquo;83 (Deputy Montgomery County Health Officer), and Chris Amidon, BSN, RN, NCSN(College Nurse) &ndash; are working closely with the Wabash Administration to get students, faculty, and staff back to campus this fall. Informed by the latest data, science, and public health guidance, we are taking steps to create the most appropriate residential experience that will keep our community, including our most vulnerable populations, as safe as possible during the COVID-19 era.</p>

<p>There is absolutely no doubt that every member of the Wabash Community will have to work diligently to limit the effect of COVID-19 on our campus. This will be a true test of the Gentleman&rsquo;s Rule &ndash; a responsibility to protect all members of the Wabash Family.</p>

<p><strong>Student Health Center Operations During the COVID-19 Pandemic</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>We are considering the best ways to care for Wabash students, while maintaining the health and safety of students and the Health Center staff.</li>
	<li>We will be requiring all students to contact Nurse Amidon via email or telephone before coming to the Student Health Center. All students will be questioned about COVID-19 symptoms and potential exposures prior to being offered an appointment. We are anticipating utilizing a combination of in-person and telehealth visits.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="covid-general"><strong>General COVID-19 Information</strong></h2>

<p>The best source for up-to-date information about COVID-19 can be found on the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html" target="_blank">CDC website</a> and the CDC <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/faq.html" target="_blank">FAQ page</a>. We recommend you bookmark these pages for easy reference.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Familiarize yourself with the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/symptoms-testing/symptoms.html">symptoms </a>of COVID-19. If you are concerned you might have COVID-19, you can use the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/symptoms-testing/index.html#cdc-chat-bot-open">CDC Coronavirus Self-Checker chat bot</a> to help you determine what type of help you might need.</li>
	<li>COVID-19 disease is caused by the virus SARS-CoV-2, a coronavirus that is spread from person-to-person through respiratory droplets and likely from touching surfaces contaminated with the virus. It is extremely contagious.</li>
	<li><strong><em>You do not have to be sick to spread the virus to others and you can catch the virus from someone who does not appear ill. </em></strong>It&rsquo;s best to assume everyone is infected and act accordingly.</li>
	<li>COVID-19 causes the most severe illness and death in older persons, particularly those who have underlying health conditions such as heart disease, diabetes, lung disease, and kidney disease. However, many young people have died from COVID-19. It is important to note that we do have students on campus who have medical conditions that put them at higher risk for severe illness and death. We have numerous faculty and staff who are older and have medical problems as well. <em><strong>We need to come together as a community to protect everyone, particularly the vulnerable persons on our campus.</strong></em></li>

<div class="faq-item">
<p class="question">How is the College planning for a return to campus?</p>

<div class="answer">
<p>Wabash College continues to prepare for its return to campus residency and in-person instruction under the guidance of the Healthy Campus Task Force (HCTF), the Academic Policy Committee, the COVID Response Team, and in consultation with a number of governmental agencies and higher education entities.</p>
</div>
</div>

<div class="faq-item">
<p class="question">What is the Healthy Campus Task Force and what does it do?</p>

<div class="answer">
<p>The Healthy Campus Task Force is composed of Chris Amidon (College Nurse), Eric Lakomek &#39;21, Malcolm Lang &#39;21, Ann Taylor (Chemistry Professor and Special Assistant to the President for COVID-19 Response and Planning), and Marc Welch (Associate Dean of Students) with regular contributions from John Roberts &#39;83 (Campus Physician and Deputy Montgomery County Health Officer) and Todd McDorman (Dean of the College). Its charge is to examine and propose changes to our facilities, procedures, practices, and operations to limit the spread of the virus and to manage illness on campus.</p>
</div>
</div>

<div class="faq-item">
<p class="question">What is the Academic Policy Committee and what does it do?</p>

<div class="answer">
<p>The Academic Policy Committee is elected by the faculty and normally drafts and approves academic policies for consideration by the faculty. They have been deliberating and making recommendations on calendaring, course policies, and best practices for classrooms and co-curricular activities.</p>
</div>
</div>

<div class="faq-item">
<p class="question">What is the COVID Response Team and what does it do?</p>

<div class="answer">
<p>The COVID Response Team is comprised of Jim Amidon (Chief of Staff), Kendra Cooks (Chief Financial Officer), Scott Feller (President), Todd McDorman (Dean of the College), Greg Redding (Dean of Students), and Ann Taylor (liaison to the HCTF). They have considered campus wide practices and procedures, and approved funding of items recommended by the Healthy Campus Task Force.</p>
</div>
</div>

<div class="faq-item">
<p class="question">What types of precautions is the College taking to reduce the spread of COVID?</p>

<div class="answer">
<p>Wabash has worked with the Independent Colleges of Indiana to obtain PPE for the Student Health Center, masks for everyone on campus, cleaning supplies, and hand sanitizer. We are placing plexiglass barriers in offices where transactions must take place, and encouraging virtual appointments and meetings. Consistent with our Gentleman&rsquo;s Rule, there will be an emphasis on personal responsibility for maintaining the health of our community.&nbsp;Each member of the college community will receive a CARE (COVID Action, Response and Education) package containing two masks, a thermometer, starter amount of hand sanitizer and refillable water bottle.</p>
</div>
</div>

<div class="faq-item">
<p class="question">What outside expertise in Public Health has the College sought in crafting its plan for the operation of campus?</p>

<div class="answer">
<p>We have received guidance from the Centers for Disease Control, American College Health Association, Indiana State Department of Health, Montgomery County Health Department, and the Fairbanks School of Public Health. We are collaborating with the Independent Colleges of Indiana and the Great Lakes Colleges Association on procurement and policy making.

<p class="question">When can staff and faculty return to their offices?</p>

<div class="answer">
<p>Discuss with your supervisor or the Dean of the College what the best time is for you to return to your office. To provide for physical distancing, for the time being many employees will continue remote work, staggered schedules, and other strategies for reducing the density of people on campus. When on campus, wear a mask when around others and in high-traffic places, wash your hands frequently, and stay home if you are ill. Additional information can be found in Guidelines for Employees and Checklist for Supervisors.</p>

<div class="faq-item">
<p class="question">How will fraternity rush work in the fall? When will new students have the opportunity to rush?</p>

<div class="answer">
<p>Beth Warner and the IFC have been working throughout the summer to help fraternities host virtual rush events and to recruit through personal outreach. To that end, each fraternity has real-time access to the contact info for new deposited students. New students will be given time to attend fraternity rush events during New Student Orientation. The exact configuration of those events and how many current fraternity members will participate is still being determined.&nbsp;Designated housing leaders (fraternity officers and resident assistants) will begin returning to campus on August 1 to prepare their spaces for new students arriving on August 7 and 8.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
</div>
</div>

<div class="faq-item">
<p class="question">How will safe physical distancing in fraternity houses and residence halls be practiced?</p>

<div class="answer">
<p>The College has received guidance from public health agencies to reduce the density in its living units.&nbsp;&nbsp;Floor plans vary widely across all living units. We are continuing to work with Campus Services on altered room configurations that maximize sleeping space for each student. This may include using some spaces for sleeping and studying that would normally be used for social gatherings. Based on each fraternity&rsquo;s historical occupancy levels, 2020-21 capacities should be minimally affected.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Capacity will be reduced in dining rooms and students will be encouraged to eat in shifts or &ldquo;grab and go.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bon Appetit and Campus Cooks are following their institutional guidelines regarding safe food preparation, handling and distribution.&nbsp;In Sparks, self-service stations and buffets have been eliminated, serving areas are spread out, plexiglass guards have been installed, and additional outdoor seating areas will be set before school begins.</p>

<div class="faq-item">
<p class="question">Are accommodations being made for international students?</p>

<div class="answer">
<p>International students, particularly incoming students, who are currently out of the country may have challenges getting to campus because embassies are closed and there will be long lines when they reopen. Chris Dixon, Senior Assistant Director of International Admissions, will be in contact with these students to keep them apprised of their options. Academic advisors will work with international students on their course schedules. International students entering the United States from their home countries will likely need to be tested at Wabash for COVID-19. This will depend on their country of origin and the recommendations for testing that are in place at the time. These students will need to quarantine on campus until the results of their COVID-19 tests are known, and possibly longer.</p>

<div class="faq-item">
<p class="question">What are plans to encourage community participation in public health best practices?</p>

<div class="answer">
<p>Students will be required to abide by the <a href="https://www.wabash.edu/covid/docs/Gentleman_s_Compact_06-11-20.pdf">Gentleman&#39;s Compact</a>, which&nbsp;was written with student input and in the spirit of the Gentleman&rsquo;s Rule. During this time of a global pandemic, we felt the need to articulate a set of conditions to help ensure general health and safety of the entire Wabash community. These standards are in keeping with recommendations from the CDC and mirror what most institutions across higher education are implementing this year.&nbsp;In addition, faculty and staff have received Employee Guidelines for returning to the workplace.</p>

<p>A COVID Action Response Educator (CARE) Team of students trained in public health practices will advocate for positive physical and mental health practices, as well as conducting public health initiatives.

<p class="faq-toplink"><a class="btn btn-sm btn-dark" href="#wfaq-top">Back to Top</a></p>

<div class="faq-item">
<p class="question">Will everyone be tested when they return to campus?</p>

<div class="answer">
<p>The College will require students, faculty, and staff to monitor symptoms and temperatures daily. The CDC, Indiana State Department of Health, and Montgomery County Health Department currently do not recommend testing of all individuals in a community. The College has consulted with epidemiologists and public health authorities and determined that widespread testing at this time could lead to unnecessary isolation and quarantine of students. This strategy may change depending on disease activity on campus and the broader community. Students who develop symptoms such as cough, fever, shortness-of-breath, new loss of taste or smell, body aches, chills, sore throat, and runny nose will be tested on campus by the Student Health Center staff. The College will identify and test students who are coming from high-risk areas such as states or counties that are showing a high prevalence of COVID-19 or that have increasing community spread. The identification of high-risk students will be made shortly before they return to campus. This testing also includes international students. The College will test athletes who are engaged in high-contact sports on their arrival to campus.&nbsp;<em>Our current plans are subject to change based on the advice of health authorities and medical professionals</em>.</p>
</div>
</div>

<div class="faq-item">
<p class="question">How can I get tested for infection?</p>

<div class="answer">
<p>At the present time, the majority of testing is recommended for people who are having symptoms of COVID-19. This recommendation will change as more testing becomes available and as public health authorities develop a strategy for testing asymptomatic people.&nbsp;There are many tests available to check for active COVID-19 infection. Most of these are performed by inserting a swab into the nose to obtain a specimen. The specimen is then either sent to a lab for testing (most common) or tested using a rapid on-site test. Both tests are looking for the COVID-19 virus RNA fingerprint.&nbsp;Wabash will employ testing to diagnose and contact trace COVID-19 on campus.&nbsp;There are not any blood tests that check for current infection.&nbsp;</p>
</div>
</div>

<div class="faq-item">
<p class="question">How will we be monitoring the number of infected students, faculty, and staff?</p>

<div class="answer">We will be using a symptom tracking app to identify ill individuals early. The app will collect basic health monitoring data such as temperature and symptoms of potential respiratory disease, e.g., cough, sore throat, rapid change in taste or smell, etc. Data will be expunged from the system at regular intervals.&nbsp;In addition to students who test positive for COVID-19 on campus, individuals who test positive through an off-campus provider will be asked to report this to the Student Health Center. Employees should report a positive COVID test to human resources at <a href="mailto:hr@wabash.edu">hr@wabash.edu</a> or by calling Cathy Metz at 765-361-6418. This information will remain confidential.</div>
</div>

<div class="faq-item">
<p class="question">What will happen if a member of the community contracts COVID-19 when we return this fall?</p>

<div class="answer">
<p>When students contract COVID-19, they will be moved to an isolation facility or be allowed to isolate off campus with their family. We will follow CDC guidelines for when a student may return to campus. Faculty and staff who contract the virus should isolate at home and contact Human Resources to receive guidance on when to return to work.</p>
</div>
</div>

<div class="faq-item">
<p class="question">What will happen if a member of the community is in close contact with a diagnosed case of COVID-19?</p>

<div class="answer">
<p>We will follow the CDC protocols for quarantine and testing people who have had close contact (closer than six feet for more than 15 minutes) with a diagnosed case of COVID-19.&nbsp;Quarantined students who are asymptomatic will continue working on their classes.</p>
</div>
</div>

<div class="faq-item">
<p class="question">What does it mean to be quarantined and what should I include in a Quarantine Kit?</p>

<div class="answer">
<p>All College students should plan for the possibility that they will have to move from their room at one point or another during the coming school year. You or a roommate might become ill, requiring you to be placed in quarantine or isolation for a few days. There is a lot of confusion about the two terms. CDC defines them as:</p>

<p>Quarantine means to &ldquo;Separate and restrict the movement of people who were exposed to a contagious disease to see if they become sick.&rdquo; Isolation means to &ldquo;Separate sick people with a contagious disease from people who are not sick.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We recommend that every student bring a Quarantine Wellness Kit to school this year. Think about what you&rsquo;d need if you had to be out of your room for a few days. Some suggestions include: Thermometer, mask or other cloth face covering, personal hygiene supplies, routine medications, cell phone and charger, small bottle of Tylenol (acetaminophen), hand sanitizer&mdash;at least 60% alcohol is recommended, laptop, books, anything you need to attend classes virtually, 2-3 changes of clothing, pillow, and items to support your mental health and&nbsp;prevent boredom.</p>
</div>
</div>

<div class="faq-item">
<p class="question">If someone in my class is diagnosed with COVID-19, will we all have to be quarantined?</p>

<div class="answer">
<p>The classrooms have been reset to allow for spacing of six feet or greater so that the entire class will not need to be quarantined.&nbsp;However, members of the class may be identified through contact tracing for quarantine and testing.</p>
</div>
</div>

<div class="faq-item">
<p class="question">What about contact tracing?</p>

<div class="answer">
<p>In Indiana, contact tracing is done through the Indiana State Department of Health. Wabash is developing ways of supplementing this tracing on campus.&nbsp;Our goal is to quarantine close contacts as soon as possible after a positive case is identified on campus.&nbsp;</p>
</div>
</div>

<div class="faq-item">
<p class="question">How can I get tested to determine if I have immunity to COVID-19?</p>

<div class="answer">
<p>We are still learning how the body responds to this virus and how we develop immunity. We don&rsquo;t know how strong the immunity is, how long it might last, or if you can get infected again.&nbsp;Many antibody tests are being rapidly developed to determine if a person has been exposed to the COVID-19 virus. Only a small number of the tests have been approved by the FDA and their reliability appears highly variable. Antibody tests may miss those who have been exposed to the virus (false negative) or may indicate someone is immune when they are not (false positive).&nbsp;<em><strong>Note that receiving a positive antibody test (indicating you have may been exposed to the virus) does NOT guarantee that you are immune and that you are safe to stop protecting yourself and others by physical distancing, hand washing and wearing a mask.&nbsp;</strong></em>The bottom line is more studies need to be done on who should be getting antibody tests and when.&nbsp;</p>
</div>
</div>

<div class="faq-item">
<p class="question">Why is Wabash requiring everyone to get a flu shot this year?</p>

<div class="answer">
<p>Respiratory influenza usually starts to appear in Indiana in the late fall and runs through the spring. This is the same time period that most infectious disease experts fear that SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, will be undergoing one or more resurgences or &quot;waves.&quot; Having influenza viruses and SARS-CoV-2 circulating at the same time has the real potential to increase the severity of illness caused by one or both viruses. Having a large outbreak could easily overwhelm our ability to care for students at Wabash and also threaten the U.S. health care system that historically has had difficulty caring for patients during severe influenza seasons. We do not yet have a vaccine to help prevent COVID-19, but we do have one to reduce the circulation of influenza viruses. We therefore feel it is critical for the entire Wabash community to be immunized for influenza this year. Dates for on-campus flu shots are September 13 (3-7 p.m.), October 1 (9 a.m. &ndash; 1 p.m.), and October 5 (4-7 p.m.). Franciscan, the health care company that administers our flu vaccines, will bill all forms of insurance, so there will be no up-front costs for students.</p>

<p class="question">How will Wabash classrooms be different this fall?</p>

<div class="answer">
<p>The College has measured every classroom to determine the appropriate number of students for each, while maintaining safe physical distance. Some classes may be taught in a &ldquo;hy-flex&rdquo; fashion, which will allow some students to attend in person and others in a virtual format. Some classes may be taught at times other than the normal 8:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. schedule. An additional 5 minutes has been added to the passing times on MWF to allow for clearing and cleaning of a classroom before the next class enters.&nbsp;All plans will be communicated in mid-July.</p>
</div>
</div>

<div class="faq-item">
<p class="question">Why is Wabash having any hybrid or virtual courses?</p>

<div class="answer">
<p>We are working on a variety of options for teaching and learning. We would use hybrid and virtual approaches because of community health (the need to spread students out among a finite supply of large classrooms) and the health of individuals in our community. Likewise, offering virtual classrooms allows students who might be isolating or quarantining to keep&nbsp;up in class, and it gives options for those students who are unable to return to campus and must learn remotely.</p>
</div>
</div>

<div class="faq-item">
<p class="question">How will students&#39; interactions in faculty and staff offices be handled?</p>

<div class="answer">
<p>For now, we will continue to encourage the use of video conferencing for office hours, individual appointments, and meetings as much as possible. In situations where physical distancing can&rsquo;t be maintained, all individuals are required to wear masks or face coverings. In settings where transactions must be performed, plexiglass shields will be installed.</p>
</div>
</div>

<div class="faq-item">
<p class="question">Where will we hold meetings and group discussions?</p>

<div class="answer">
<p>Everyone in the community should plan to conduct as many meetings as possible using Zoom or a similar virtual platform for both individual appointments and group meetings.&nbsp;Room capacities have been adjusted on Scheduler to reflect social distancing seating and all rooms will have maximum capacities posted.</p>

</div>

<div class="faq-item">
<p class="question">Will campus buildings like the Fine Arts Center, Library, and Allen Center remain closed to the public?</p>

<p class="question">What is the definition of the &quot;Wabash Bubble&quot; or &quot;Wabash Campus Community?&quot; Does this include families of Wabash faculty and staff, emeritus professors, parents of students, etc.?</p>

<div class="answer">
<p>The fewer people who are in our bubble, the better we will be able to manage data and infection rates. So, for the beginning of the year, the bubble will be limited to those who participate in our symptom tracking program (required for Wabash students, faculty and staff).&nbsp;The Healthy Campus Task Force is in the process of developing a campus visitor policy. We anticipate that the policy will be tailored in different ways to meet the diverse needs of each area of campus.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="question">How Can I Reduce the Spread of COVID Virus?</p>

<div class="answer">
<ul>
	<li>We know the virus spreads when people are in close contact with one another and that you don&rsquo;t have to have any symptoms to spread the virus to others. The most important thing you can do to reduce infecting others is to maintain physical distancing of at least six&nbsp;feet and avoid small, crowded indoor spaces with poor ventilation.</li>
	<li>When Wabash re-opens, we will require all students, faculty, and staff to wear cloth facemasks that cover the nose and mouth when they can&#39;t maintain physical distancing of at least six feet. This requirement will apply everywhere on the Wabash campus, including living units.</li>
	<li>Everyone will need to practice frequent <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/handwashing/" target="_blank">handwashing</a> or cleaning their hands using at least 60% alcohol-based hand sanitizer. It is crucial that you avoid touching your face, mouth, nose or eyes. See our <a href="https://www.wabash.edu/studentlife/docs/Handwashing_and_Old_Wabash.pdf" target="_blank">handwashing instructions to the tune of &ldquo;Old Wabash&rdquo;.</a></li>
	<li>You should cough and sneeze into your elbow, sleeve or better yet use a tissue.</li>
	<li><em><strong>We will strongly recommend that everyone limit in-person social interactions with visitors who are not part of the Wabash community.</strong></em> This includes gatherings such as parties, etc. If a person visits from outside our community, he or she must practice the prevention strategies listed above.</li>
	<li>We may require you to quarantine if you are returning to campus from travel to a high-risk area, both in the U.S. and Internationally.</li>
	<li>For those students who become infected and are unable to leave campus (or it would not be wise to do so), the College will provide alternate housing for those in isolation or quarantine. COVID-positive students will be placed together in special living quarters.</li>
	<li>The College has stepped up and will continue its disinfection practices, and asks students, staff, and faculty to pitch in to ensure we all adhere to strategies to keep our environment clean.</li>
	<li>While the College will supply CARE packages to everyone in the community (including two cloth face masks, hand sanitizer, thermometer, and watter bottle), students should bring an additional reliable thermometer with them to campus to monitor their temperature. <em><strong>Note that thermometers are difficult to find, so put your order in now.</strong></em> Everyone should bring a good supply of facial tissues (Kleenex) to cough and sneeze into and throw them away after use.</li>

<p class="question">What Should I Do if I&rsquo;ve Been Exposed to Someone Who Has COVID-19?</p>

<div class="answer">
<p>Contact the Student Health Center for advice. Depending on your exposure, you may need to be quarantined for 14 days from the last date you had contact with the infected person. This means you must stay at home or in your room on campus and monitor yourself for symptoms. Please read the CDC&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/if-you-are-sick/quarantine-isolation.html">recommendations about quarantine</a>.</p>

<p class="question">What is the Difference Between Quarantine and Isolation?</p>

<div class="answer">
<p><strong>Quarantine: </strong>Quarantine is used to keep someone who might have been exposed to COVID-19 away from others. Someone in self-quarantine stays separated from others, and they limit movement outside of their home or current place. A person may have been exposed to the virus without knowing it (for example, when traveling or out in the community), or they could have the virus without feeling symptoms. Quarantine helps limit further spread of COVID-19.</p>

<p><strong>Isolation:</strong>Isolation is used to separate sick people from healthy people. People who are in isolation should stay home. In the home, anyone sick should separate themselves from others by staying in a specific &ldquo;sick&rdquo; bedroom or space and using a different bathroom (if possible).</p>
