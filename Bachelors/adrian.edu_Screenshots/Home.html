          <p>ADRIAN COLLEGE — Mulch is being spread, flowers are blooming, green grass is growing and just like every other year, Adrian College’s campus is simply beautiful during springtime. The only thing missing are the people who make Adrian College the fine educational facility it is. However, it is just a matter of time before the campus will be back to normal and filled once again with the wonderful energy, vitality and comradery of students, faculty and staff that Adrian College is known for.</p><p>To help you understand what is going on during the uncertain times brought on by the Coronavirus, Adrian College’s senior staff has decided it cannot overcommunicate with our students and the community, and will continue to provide regular updates. The senior staff meets each week to determine the issues and actions that should be shared widely so we can all stay informed.</p>
<p>Last week, Adrian College President Jeffrey Docking sent out four personalized videos; to all students, incoming students, graduating students, and alumni and friends of the college. To view the videos, use the following links:</p>

<p><a href="https://vimeo.com/402622631" target="_blank">https://vimeo.com/402622631</a>&nbsp;- All students</p>

<p><a href="https://vimeo.com/403354340" target="_blank">https://vimeo.com/403354340</a>&nbsp;- Alumni and friends</p>

<p>The College is reminding students that the May Term (May 6-June 3) will be online. Enrollment and registration are currently open for the May term, online at&nbsp;<a href="https://apply.adrian.edu/" target="_blank">https://apply.adrian.edu/</a>. The Registrar’s Office is open and available to help with the enrollment and registration process. For information on available courses, go online to&nbsp;<a href="http://adrian.edu/students-staff/" target="_blank">http://adrian.edu/students-staff/</a>.</p>

<p>Adrian College recently decided that the Summer Term (June 10-July 22) courses will also be online.</p>

<p>As a reminder, registration is now open for all current students for the fall semester. For more information or to sign up, go online to the Registrar’s Office,&nbsp;<a href="http://adrian.edu/academics/registrar/" target="_blank">http://adrian.edu/academics/registrar/</a>. Housing applications are also being accepted,&nbsp;<a href="http://adrian.edu/admissions/incoming-student-information/housing-information/" target="_blank">http://adrian.edu/admissions/incoming-student-information/housing-information/</a>.</p>

<p>Adrian College has remained open during this outbreak. Housing has continued to be available for students as well as curbside library services, Academic Support Services, and professors are providing online classes. Ritchie Dining also remained open and is offering carry-out services as ordered by Governor Gretchen Whitmer.</p>

<p>The College has received questions regarding room and board reimbursements. Our senior staff is currently looking into these questions and a separate correspondence will be sent from the Business Office soon to all affected students.</p>

<p>Students are reminded to retrieve personal housing items prior to May 3. Students should check their College email for a Google sign-up sheet to select a checkout date and time. All students must fill out an express checkout waiver in the Caine Student Center before they depart from the college. Forms are available on a table in front of the student mailboxes. Once completed, take the form and key and return it in the drop slot by the mailroom door on the wall. Any student unable to retrieve their belongings or unable to leave by May 3 needs to fill out an appeal form to remain on campus. See the following link:&nbsp;<a href="https://forms.gle/15cqJCxBz11ecgLj7" target="_blank">https://forms.gle/15cqJCxBz11ecgLj7</a>. For more information, e-mail&nbsp;<a href="mailto:housing@adrian.edu" target="_blank">housing@adrian.edu</a>.</p>

<p>Adrian College is deeply grateful for your understanding, cooperation and partnership during this unprecedented time. The College will continue sending updates via email and adding additional reports to adrian.edu to keep you informed.</p>

<h2>Adrian College COVID-19 Update, 3-30-2020</h2><p>ADRIAN COLLEGE (3.30.2020) — President Donald Trump on Sunday, March 29, 2020 extended federal social distancing guidelines through April 30, to slow the spread of Coronavirus (COVID-19).</p>

<p>President Trump said in a White House news conference that modeling estimates show that the virus will likely peak in two weeks. He added the United States will be “well on our way to recovery, we think by June 1.”</p>

<p>Adrian College’s senior staff created the following information to respond to the most commonly asked questions. We hope this information is helpful, but please do not hesitate to call the College if you have additional questions.</p>

<p><b>Are classes online for the remainder of the semester?</b></p>

<p>Yes. Because of the social distancing extension, Adrian College will continue classes, labs and studios online through the May semester, including exams. Adrian College will also determine at a later date if there will be face-to-face summer classes.</p>

<p><b>Will graduation be postponed?</b></p>

<p>Yes. The extension of limiting groups to 10 people or less until April 30 has forced Adrian College to postpone its May 3 commencement.</p>

<p><b>Is the College committed to another date and time for graduation?</b></p>

<p>Yes. Adrian College President Jeffrey Docking told his senior staff on Monday the College will recognize the accomplishments of its seniors and graduate students at an appropriate time.</p>

<p>“When the threat of Coronavirus is over, we are fully committed to providing a graduation ceremony for our students,” Docking said. “We understand the amount of hard work and commitment it takes to earn a degree from Adrian College. My senior team is looking at all options available to reschedule the graduation ceremony at a time that is convenient for students and families in the not-too-distant future.”</p>

<p><b>Is the College open?</b></p>

<p>Yes. The College has remained open and is following all of Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer’s orders, pursuant to Executive Order 2020-9. Most departments, including academic support services, residence halls and food services, remain open at this time.</p>

<p><b>Are custodial services still on campus cleaning high-traffic areas?</b></p>

<p>Yes. Custodial services remain on campus and our staff is committed to providing a safe, healthy environment for the College community.</p>

<p><b>Are there any confirmed COVID-19 cases on campus?</b></p>

<p>To the best of our knowledge, there are no reported or confirmed COVID-19 cases on campus. Adrian College’s student Health Center Director, Dr. Emily Kist, continues to monitor the situation closely and sends out regular updates.</p>

<p><b>Have any students remained on campus?</b></p>

<p>Yes. Adrian College currently has 153 students on campus. Students have been allowed to remain in their dorms for a variety of reasons. A number of students have asked to remain on campus for reasons including: their homes are located in areas where a large number of people have the virus. Some students have stated they have vulnerable family members and they don’t want to pose a health risk. Other students are relying on the campus internet to complete courses, as well as utilize carryout food services in our dining areas.</p>

<p>Adrian College is very grateful that Sodexo at Ritchie Marketplace has continued offering to-go lunch and dinner options, and is following the Governor’s social distancing and facility cleaning guidelines.</p>

<p><b>Is Adrian College abiding by all social distancing guidelines?</b></p>

<p>Yes. David Stimpson, Chairman of the Lenawee County Board of Commissioners, on March 27 released Emergency Order 2020-02 requiring all Lenawee County businesses and operations that are open to screen employees daily for COVID-19 symptoms and implement a plan to provide for social distancing. Adrian College is following the emergency order and will be screening any employee who physically reports to the College campus. In addition, updates concerning COVID-19 are being sent out on a regular basis to students, faculty and staff. Flyers with updates on this ongoing health issue will also be posted at strategic locations around campus.</p>

<p><b>Does the College security staff still have a presence on campus?</b></p>

<p>Yes. Adrian College’s campus currently has security coverage, 24/7.</p>

<p><b>Can a student who went home retrieve personal items they left in their residence hall?</b></p>

<p>Yes. Sunday, May 3 is the deadline for students who want to retrieve items from their room. Please contact Melinda Schwyn, Dean of Students/Student Affairs, to schedule a pick-up.</p>

<p><b>Is the bookstore open?</b></p>

<p>The Bookstore is currently offering online orders only. For more information, go online to https://arringtonbookstore.adrian.edu/ or email bookstore@adrian.edu.</p>

<h2>First positive COVID-19 case reported in Lenawee County</h2><p>ADRIAN COLLEGE (3.25.20) — The Lenawee County Health Department (LCHD) announced on Tuesday that the first positive test result for the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been reported in Lenawee County. An unnamed adult female from Lenawee County tested positive and is currently self-isolating. The LCHD has contacted those who have been in close contact with the patient to assess for symptoms and provide quarantine instructions. The LCHD said in a press release that it will monitor the woman.</p>

<p>Individuals who have been in close contact with someone who has COVID-19 should self-quarantine for 14 days and monitor themselves for fever, cough, and shortness of breath. COVID-19 symptoms may appear in as few as two days or as long as 14 days after exposure to the virus.</p>

<p>“Residents in Lenawee County can help prevent the spread of COVID-19 by staying home and following Governor Gretchen Whitmer’s “Stay Home, Stay Safe” executive order,” Martha Hall, Health Officer of the Lenawee County Health Department, said in a press release. “Everyone must do their part to prevent the spread of COVID-19. Your actions today will affect not only your future, but the future of your friends and family.”</p>

<p>To prevent the spread of COVID-19, the LCHD recommends:</p>

<p>• Washing hands with soap frequently&nbsp;</p>

<p>• Cover coughs and sneezes with a tissue or cough or sneeze into an elbow&nbsp;</p>

<p>• Avoid touching the face</p>

<p>• Stay home when sick</p>

<p>• Avoid close contact with sick people</p>

<p>• Only leave home for essential services</p>

<p>• Keep six feet between themselves and others when having to leave home</p>

<p>People who are concerned that they may have COVID-19 should call their healthcare provider. They will likely be assessed by phone to determine if they should be tested for COVID-19.

The Campus’ wireless networking service remains functioning and available to all students. With additional restrictions in place, Adrian College has extended its online classes through April 10.</p>

<p>At this time, a final decision has not been made regarding postponing Adrian College’s Commencement ceremony. Should the May 3 event be cancelled, arrangements will be made to conduct the ceremony at a later date after restrictions are lifted.</p>

<p>“If we are forced to cancel our scheduled Commencement ceremony, Adrian College is fully committed to give our graduates the recognition they deserve by offering an alternative commencement date for those able to attend,” President Docking said.</p>

<p>All other dates and times concerning academic schedules remain in place. All students who complete their classwork will still officially graduate on May 3, as previously planned, with or without a ceremony.</p>

<p>The College continues to work with its international students and supports whatever decision they and their families make concerning a return to their homes. Adrian College will work with these students to complete academic requirements.</p>

<p>Adrian College’s residence halls and dining service remain open, as well as all administration offices and student support services.</p>

<p>Ritchie Marketplace will be open from 11 a.m. to 1 p.m. and 5 to 7 p.m., and the Caine Student Center’s Grill &amp; Zime will be open from noon to 7 p.m. Paws &amp; Go C-store is open 24 hours, offering selections of to-go items.

<p>The Student Health Center remains open and its Director, Dr. Emily Kist, is emailing the campus community regularly with updates.</p>

<p>Custodial services on campus have been increased to ensure all facilities are cleaned regularly.</p>

<p>In addition, campus security has also been increased to ensure Adrian College is following state orders, for the health and safety of its students, faculty and staff.</p>

<h2>Ritchie Marketplace remains open, converts to mandatory carryout operation</h2><p>ADRIAN COLLEGE (3.16.20) — In order to comply with the most recent Governor Gretchen Whitmer order banning restaurants from offering dine-in services through March, Ritchie Marketplace converted to a full mandatory carryout operation at 3 p.m. today, March 16. Guests will be provided with all the items needed to take their food to go and there will be no seated dining inside any area of the cafe. Slight modifications have been made to stations to convert self-service areas into staff-served areas to limit customer contact, and staff ask that guests attempt to keep a distance of six feet while within both Ritchie Marketplace and Caine Student Center.</p>

<p>Nicholas Moorehead, General Manager of Sodexo at Adrian College, expects the food service facilities to continue to maintain the same levels of service in regards to food options under the current order, though certain items will need to be requested from staff if previously found in a full self-serve area.</p>

<p>“Staff will continue constant cleaning of customer contact areas to ensure the health and safety of our patrons,” Moorehead said.</p>

<h2>Gov. Whitmer limits all events and assemblages until April 5</h2><p>ADRIAN COLLEGE (3.16.20) — Adrian College continues to monitor and conduct regular physical counts on campus during the COVID-19 outbreak. The Ritchie Marketplace has opened additional space to allow limited seating in separate spaces, due to Governor Gretchen Whitmer’s Executive Order to cancel all events over 250 people and all assemblages in shared spaces over 250 people beginning on Friday, March 13 at 5 p.m. The following announcement was released by the State of Michigan earlier today.</p>

<p>Today, Governor Gretchen Whitmer signed Executive Order 2020-5 to cancel all events over 250 people and all assemblages in shared spaces over 250 people beginning on Friday, March 13 at 5 p.m. and ending on Sunday, April 5 at 5 p.m. The governor’s executive order also closes all K-12 school buildings to students from Monday, March 16 until Sunday, April 5. Child care facilities will remain open during this time, whether they are attached to schools or free standing.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Under this executive order, all events and shared-space assemblages of more than 250 people are temporarily prohibited in the state. Certain assemblages are exempt from this prohibition, such as those for the purpose of: industrial or manufacturing work, mass transit, or the purchase of groceries or consumer goods.</p>

<p>“This is about protecting the most people we can from the spread of coronavirus,” said Governor Whitmer. “My administration will continue to do everything we can to mitigate the spread, and to ensure our children, families, and businesses have the support they need during this time. We are going to get through this, but we must be flexible and take care of each other.”</p>

<p>“Prohibiting large assemblages is the smart thing to do to mitigate the spread of COVID-19,” said Michigan Department of Health and Human Services Chief Deputy for Health and Chief Medical Executive Dr. Joneigh Khaldun. “It’s crucial that everyone in Michigan follow these orders and make smart choices that will slow the spread of the virus, including practicing good hygiene and social distancing. We will continue to work with the governor and our partners across state government to protect Michigan families and businesses.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>Patients with confirmed infection have reportedly had mild to severe respiratory illness with symptoms of:&nbsp;</p>

<p>• Fever&nbsp;</p>

<p>• Cough&nbsp;</p>

<p>• Shortness of breath</p>

<p>The best prevention for viruses, such as influenza, the common cold or COVID-19 is to:</p>

<p>If you think you have been exposed to COVID-19, call your health care provider. If you do not have a health care provider, call the nearest hospital.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Wash your hands often with soap and warm water for 20 seconds. If not available, use hand sanitizer.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<p>Avoid touching your eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<p>Cover your mouth and nose with a tissue or upper sleeve when coughing or sneezing.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<p>Avoid contact with people who are sick.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<p>If you are sick, stay home, and avoid contact with others.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Replace handshakes with elbow bumps.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Stay at least 6 feet away from others when in a public setting. Information around this outbreak is changing rapidly.</p>

<p>President</p><h2>Adrian College Coronavirus (COVID-19) information</h2>

<p>ADRIAN College (March 11, 2020) — Re: COVID-19 Coronavirus</p>

<p>Dear Adrian College faculty, staff and students;</p>

<p>As I am sure you are all aware, the corona virus Covid-19 has been spreading and increasing in occurrences worldwide. Emily Kist DNP and I have been monitoring the situation closely. There have been at least three confirmed cases in Ohio and two confirmed cases here in Michigan. The documented cases in the State of Michigan have been in Oakland and Wayne Counties. There have been several universities that are cancelling on campus classes and transitioning to online courses. At this time, we do not believe this to be the best approach for Adrian College, however, as the situation evolves we will make the necessary decisions to promote the health and safety of all persons associated with the college. Please find below links to the most updated CDC information and guidelines.</p>

<p>As previously noted from the CDC, the current recommendation is good hand hygiene, and normal standard viral precautions. If you have recently traveled an endemic area or have been in contact with someone who has traveled and are feeling ill you should stay away from other individuals, stay home from classes. You can be evaluated at the Student Health Center as needed, local urgent cares or by your primary physician for recommendations regarding treatment and testing. Most young healthy individuals who have contracted this virus recover very well. If you are immunocompromised you are at greater risk.</p>

<p>https://emergency.cdc.gov/han/2020/han00429.asp?deliveryName+USCDC</p>

<p>Please wash your hands regularly, refrain from touching your face or other people (handshakes, holding hands, etc.). If you are ill the recommendation is that you wear a mask, not that the general population wear masks.</p>

<p>Sincerely,</p>

<p>Aron Gornowicz, DO, FAOASM</p>
