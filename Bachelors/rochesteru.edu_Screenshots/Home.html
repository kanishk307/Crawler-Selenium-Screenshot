<h3>Rochester University plans reopen of campus in fall</h3>
<p>Rochester University plans to reopen campus for the fall 2020 semester with safety precautions and preparedness in place to protect students, employees and the community in light of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>The university formed a COVID-19 Preparedness and Response Team in the spring to develop policies and procedures for the campus. The plan is guided by the recommendations and policies of local, state, and federal health and governmental officials, and is designed to be adaptable and responsive to the most current scientific and public policy developments.</p>
<p>President Brian Stogner said the university is committed to keeping its community safe while also maintaining its mission to prepare students for professional and personal success as they serve in God’s world. “We intend to provide a safe environment for all students to pursue their studies in a setting designed to protect their health and safety while ensuring academic quality,” he said.</p>
<p>The academic program will be delivered with face-to-face, hybrid and online classes. Social distancing, masks, enhanced sanitation procedures and other measures will be instituted.<br />
Key elements of the fall reopening plan include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Social distancing for all classes and labs with limited class sizes</li>
<li>Facemasks will be provided by RU and are required for all students/employees until CDC removes recommendation,</li>
<li>Disinfecting across campus each day and in classrooms after each class</li>
<li>Hand sanitizer stations positioned throughout campus and in each classroom</li>
<li>Portable UV disinfecting scanners for labs/classrooms</li>
<li>Webcams and microphones installed in each classroom for enhanced virtual viewing</li>
<li>All classes can transition to virtual/online at any time needed</li>
<li>Daily student and employee screening and symptom checklist with COVID-19 testing for anyone who displays or reports symptoms</li>
<li>Residential students will have twice-daily screening and staggered meal schedules to increase social distancing</li>
<li>RU is working closely with the Wolverine-Hoosier Athletic Conference and NAIA to determine next steps for intercollegiate sports.</li>
</ul>
<p>Stogner said the Fall 2020 Campus Reopening Plan is subject to revision as new information and circumstances emerge. Classes for the fall semester are scheduled to begin on Aug. 29. Please make plans to join us for one of our <a href="https://rochesteru.edu/events/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Virtual Town Halls</a> with Rochester University&#8217;s Senior Leadership Team. On June 29, 2020, the RU Preparedness and Response Team shared the following institution-wide plan: <a href="https://my.rochesteru.edu/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/RU-COVID-19-Preparedness-and-Response-Plan-FINAL-2020.0629.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RU Preparedness and Response Plan »</a></p>

<p>Dear Students,</p>
<p>I write to you today as you are beginning a truly unique final exams week. Your professors, as well as the entire Rochester University staff have worked diligently and with great resolve to make your experience this semester as fruitful and beneficial for you as it can be. I know that it has been a tough adjustment for so many of you as you&#8217;ve had to adapt to a changed course delivery model, along with the immense personal challenges of adjusting to life in a pandemic. These are times unlike any in our lifetime.</p>
<p>My encouragement to you today is &#8211; Finish Strong! You can do this! I have been amazed by the strength and resilience of RU students throughout this difficult time. I am praying for you every day, as are the faculty and staff or your university. The RU community is also still working every day to educate you and assist you however we can. Please do not hesitate to reach out to us if there&#8217;s some way we can help you.</p>
<p>We are planning and preparing for a great fall, 2020 semester at RU. There will likely be some changes we will need to make to ensure we act appropriately to protect the health of our community. Rochester University is well positioned to make those changes. Our small class sizes and ability to adapt quickly are great advantages in this environment. Most of all, the personal concern we have for each of you ensures that your safety and well-being will be protected and we will attend to your needs. At RU, you are never simply a name on a registration sheet or a student number on a roster. We see each of you as an image-bearer of God and a vital part of our community. There is still significant uncertainty from government and health officials about how things will look and what we will be required to do this fall, but we will communicate to you regularly and promptly as more information becomes available to us.</p>
<p>If you are graduating this semester, please know that we will do everything we can to provide a special ceremony for you when conditions permit. You deserve rich recognition and congratulations! If you have not yet finished your degree, I cannot wait to see you back on campus! I am eagerly anticipating the day when our community can once again gather in person.</p>
<p>If you were taking all of your classes online before the COVD-19 crisis hit, I know that you have still had to make many adjustments and adaptations. Please know that RU is dedicated to enriching your experience. We have invested significant resources into improving the online experience and are confident that you will benefit from them, as well as have the opportunity to engage more deeply in our community, even from a distance.</p>
<p>Every RU student is important to us. As you finish up this finals week, our prayer is that God will give you strength, that you will feel a sense of calm in the face of anxiety-provoking times, and that you will move more closely to fulfilling your dreams and potential.</p>
<p>Best regards and blessings to all of you,</p>
<p>Brian Stogner, Ph. D.<br />
President<br />

<p>Dear RU Theatre Patrons,</p>
<p>Following our announcement that we hoped to postpone our production of Sweeney Todd to early June, many of you have reached out to our box office requesting updates about alternate performance dates. We cannot express our gratitude enough for your enthusiasm and support.</p>
<p>As we have monitored the situation, it has become clear that everything will not return to normal as soon as we hoped. As public safety continues to be the number one concern, some summer events on our campus and around the world have been cancelled to safeguard the health of our communities. We are seeing this in the theatre world at large, as Broadway shows are closed until at least June 7th, West End theatre is closed until at least June 30th, and theatres across the country have cancelled entire summer seasons.</p>
<p>We have spent a long time thinking through our plans for Sweeney Todd, bearing all of this in mind. After weighing every possible option, we have made the difficult but necessary decision to cancel the production. We regret deeply that we do not get to share this production with you but take pride in knowing that our cast and crew had already done some incredible work. We hope to showcase some of this work in the future.</p>
<p>If you have not yet done so, you can still contact the box office (theatre@rc.edu) to donate your tickets to the department or request a refund. We would like to thank all of you that have already decided to donate for helping us continually provide an excellent education for our students on and off the stage.</p>
<p>While we are sad to close the doors on this production, we are excitedly looking forward to the future. We are using this time to prepare for an exciting 2020-2021 season and cannot wait to welcome you back into our theatre sometime soon.<br />

<p>Colleagues,</p>
<p>I hope this communication finds you healthy,and adjusting well to virtual classes. Given the extraordinary circumstances that we find ourselves in, RU has expanded grading options for the Spring 2020 semester, and we are giving students the option to take classes for Credit (CR) in lieu of a letter grade. For this semester only, any failed course will appear as No Credit (NC), and will not count against a student’s GPA.</p>
<p>Students who require extra time to complete their coursework may make a request to their faculty for an Incomplete (I). Faculty may also assess the need to assign an Incomplete (I) this semester.<br />
To allow time for students to evaluate their options, and speak with advisers and instructors, the decision deadline for students who elect to shift their graded classes to CR is extended to May 1, 2020. The deadline to request an Incomplete (I) is within two weeks of completion of the semester.</p>
<p>I want to emphasize that students should take time to carefully assess their circumstances, and discuss the options with their advisers and instructors. Choosing to take one or more classes for CR will not be the correct decision for every student.</p>
<p>In making these decisions, please help your students to consider graduate school and licensure grade requirements, effects on SAP calculations, athletic team eligibility, scholarships, or veteran benefit eligibility.</p>
<p>The guidelines for CR/NC are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Any class can be taken for CR, including classes that students are using to fulfill program requirements.</li>
<li>Students will receive a grade of CR if they receive a passing grade in the course. All departmental policies for passing standards still apply. It is important for students to understand their program/course GPA requirements, and discuss decisions to convert a course to CR with an adviser and faculty.</li>
<li>CR and NC grades do not factor into a student’s GPA.</li>
<li>NC will not count as a completed requirement, but it does not reduce the student’s GPA.</li>
</ul>
<p>The guidelines for Incomplete (I) eligibility are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>The majority of coursework is complete.</li>
<li>The student has a passing grade based on submitted assignments.</li>
<li>The student encounters severe hardship (the stress of COVID-19 applies).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>PROCESS</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Each student who wishes to take a class for Credit (CR) must complete the process before 5:00 pm on May 1, 2020; this is not an automatic action.<br />
Students need to complete the <a href="https://wix.us8.list-manage.com/track/click?u=376a7565187c7ad0356256d98&amp;id=5d6fc45976&amp;e=31f20555bf">Credit Grade Spring 2020 Application</a> which can be found by signing into their <a href="https://my.rochesteru.edu/">student portal</a>.</li>
<li>Students request CR prior to 5:00 pm EST on May 1, 2020, if they wish to switch from a normal grade to CR.</li>
<li>Students should consult with their instructors and advisers before making this choice. You can help the students to determine if this is a prudent move for them.</li>
<li>Students can only make one change per course; that is, if they elect to go Credit (CR) on a course, they cannot change back, even prior to the deadline.</li>
<li>Students who request and receive approval for extra time to complete their course requirements will receive an Incomplete (I), and the CR/NC option is not available.</li>
<li>For approved Incomplete (I) courses, <strong>faculty will submit</strong> the <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfmwr9tkZ6oyoncHbk_O5H3xrvM5PIjQuaR25sAO--1-KYTAA/viewform">Incomplete Notification to the Registrar form</a> to the Office of the Registrar as required.</li>
</ul>
<p>Financial Aid:</p>
<ul>
<li>To maintain eligibility for financial aid, <strong>students must maintain Satisfactory Academic Progression (SAP)</strong>. The Academic and Financial Aid SAP policies are one and the same at RU, and can be found in the <a href="http://docs.rochesteru.edu/2019-2020/Course-Catalog/Academics/Satisfactory-Academic-Progress-Policy">catalog</a>.</li>
<li>NC grades do not affect GPA, and do not constitute a completed course. Students are still expected to maintain a 2.0 CGPA for SAP, and departmental policies for passing standards apply.</li>
</ul>
<p>Deadlines:</p>
<ul>
<li>The deadline to withdraw from a course with a W has been extended to April 27, 2020. This applies to Session B, and semester-long courses for Spring 2020.</li>
<li>The deadline to request courses for CR is before 5:00 pm on May 1, 2020.</li>
<li>The request for an Incomplete must be received within two weeks of the completion of the semester. Faculty must approve a student’s request and submit a form to the Office of the Registrar.</li>
</ul>
<p>Take Care. Be well. Be patient with yourself and others during these challenging times. Wash your hands!</p>
<p>We Rise Together.</p>

<p>Residents,</p>
<p>In light of the recent email you have received from Rochester University regarding COVID-19, Residence Life has decided on an Express Move Out of the residence halls.</p>
<p>To limit the number of people in the residence halls in accordance with CDC guidelines, <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1mZrTRkOze4cLGru_HPwU1aRkZVNBLmvnImx3Dv-uaCs/edit?ts=5e73ce6d#gid=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">please sign up for a Move Out Time</a>. Because of limited staffing and desiring to keep everyone safe, we have blocked off specific times and dates for residents to move off-campus.  Please see the following to-do list to ensure a seamless move-out</p>
<ul>
<li>Pack all belongings and move them into your vehicle</li>
<li>Unloft/unbunk your beds</li>
<li>Place lofting pins in the top desk drawer</li>
<li>Remove all trash bags and walk them to the dumpster</li>
<li>Check and empty your mailboxes</li>
<li>Place your room key and mailbox key in the envelope taped to your door</li>
<li>Sign Room Inventory Form and place in envelope</li>
<li>Place sealed envelope in the express check out box outside of building supervisors door</li>
</ul>
<p>In order to limit the number of people in the residence halls, please only have one (1) family member or friend assist you in moving out of the residence halls. All main doors will be propped open and there are hand sanitizing stations in the lobby areas. Please wash your hands throughout this process to minimize the spread of germs. If you are sick, not feeling well, or have been exposed please email us to make other arrangements. If you want to designate someone to get your belongings please email us their full name. They will need to bring proof of ID before we will provide them access to your room.</p>
<p>If you are unable to return to campus at this time to retrieve your belongings because of travel difficulties, please contact us by email.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.uhaul.com/Articles/About/20625/College-Students-U-Haul-Offers-30-Days-Free-Self-Storage-amid-Coronavirus-Outbreak/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">UHaul is offering free storage</a> and discounts for college students moving out of the residence halls because of COVID-19 closedown. In addition, <a href="https://www.enterprise.com/en/car-rental/deals/young-driver.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Enterprise</a> is also reducing the age car rental minimum and waiving the young renter fees for rentals through May 31, 2020.</p>
<p>We appreciate your understanding during this time. This Express Move Out plan has been designed with your health and safety in mind and to limit exposure to COVID-19. Although this process is not ideal, our staff appreciates your flexibility during this time.</p>
<p>Further information regarding room and board partial credit/refunds for spring semester 2020 will be sent out next week. Thank you for your continued patience and flexibility, if you have any questions please do not hesitate to contact us.<br />
Thank you,</p>
<p>Residence Life</p>

<p>Dear Students,</p>
<p>As together we continue to live through the trauma of the COVID-19 pandemic, I wanted to drop you all a quick note and include some important announcements. First, I must let you know how empty our campus feels without your presence and energy! You are sorely missed. The past several days have brought some profound transitions and there are likely more still ahead. In the face of all of that, be assured that the RU faculty and staff continue to be fully dedicated to providing an outstanding education and excellent service to our students. I realize that these are stressful and anxiety-provoking times for you and your families. Please be assured that we will continue to do everything we can to ensure that the semester runs as smoothly as possible, and that you are able to get the services you need as you work on your studies.</p>
<p>In an effort to maximize our efforts to protect the health and well-being of our community, effective tomorrow (March 20) we are enacting a work-at-home policy for all of our campus offices. We will lock down buildings, (with the exception of the Campus Center and other residence and dining services, as we will continue to house and feed dozens of students on campus.) All offices and functions will continue to remain open, but we will conduct our business remotely. The IT Helpdesk will continue to be functional. Please email helpdesk@rc.edu for those requests. This plan will be in place until April 5 and we will communicate any extension beyond that date, if necessary. You may expect regular communications and updates from me throughout the next few weeks.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Academic Cabinet met and firmed up several other decisions related to the remainder of this semester:</p>
<ul>
<li>Virtual Instruction: All classes will be conducted fully online through the rest of the semester.</li>
<li>Postponed Events:
<ul>
<li>May 2: Spring Commencement Ceremony &#8211; We are postponing this ceremony most likely until late August with exact date to be determined.<br />
If you would like to return your graduation regalia, there is a 30 day refund period in which you may do so without penalty. Please email the Registrar&#8217;s office (registrar@rc.edu) if you would like to pursue this refund and they will walk you through the process with the regalia company.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Cancelled Events:
<ul>
<li>April 24: Capstone Conference &#8211; Students will continue to work on, and submit, their final projects. We are working on ways we can showcase and celebrate student accomplishments throughout the rest of the semester on website or social media.</li>
<li>April 24: Academic Awards Ceremony &#8211; The nomination process will continue. Awards/Certificates will be mailed to students, and showcased on website or social media.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Withdraw Date:<br />
The last date to withdraw from classes will be extended by two weeks to April 3 as you adjust to the new learning environment.<br />
We encourage you to guard your health by following the guidelines and recommendations of health professionals and government officials. We are continuing in prayer for you and your families.</li>
</ul>
<p>Blessings,<br />
Dr. Stogner</p>

<p>Dear Colleagues,</p>
<p>As we together continue to live through the trauma of the COVID-19 pandemic, I wanted to drop you all a quick note and include some important announcements. First, I must express my gratitude to you all for your commitment to your work, our students, and our mission. The past several days have brought some profound transitions and there are likely more still ahead. In the face of all of that, I am deeply impressed with the RU spirit and with your continuing prioritization of providing an outstanding education and excellent service to our students. I realize that these are stressful and anxiety-provoking times and it has been gratifying to see so many of you extending yourself to be of service to our students and to each other, in spite of that stress.</p>
<p>In an effort to maximize our efforts to protect the health and well-being of our community, effective tomorrow (March 20) we are enacting a work-at-home policy for all of our campus offices. We will lock down buildings, (with the exception of the Campus Center, as we continue to house and feed dozens of students on campus.) All offices and functions will continue to remain open, but we will conduct our business remotely. If you need to be let in to access your office or workspace, please contact your immediate supervisor and we will make arrangements to get you access. The IT Helpdesk will continue to be functional. Please email helpdesk@rc.edu for those requests. This plan will be in place until April 5 and we will communicate any extension beyond that date, if necessary. You may expect regular communications and updates from me throughout the next few weeks.</p>
<p>Partnership Dinner has been postponed. We will announce the rescheduled date as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Academic Cabinet met and firmed up several other decisions related to the remainder of this semester:</p>
<ul>
<li>Virtual Instruction: Fully online instruction will continue through the rest of the semester. We will be formally announcing this decision, along with the schedule changes below, in an email to students later today.</li>
<li>Postponed Events:
<ul>
<li>May 2: Spring Commencement Ceremony &#8211; We are postponing this ceremony to late August with date TBD. We are still assessing the feasibility, benefits, and challenges of hosting this in late August taking into account staff/faculty bandwidth with move-in day and Ice-Cream Olympics.<br />
Informing students now allows them to return their regalia within the 30 day refund period without penalty.</li>

<li>Cancelled Events:

RU Athletes and Coaches,</p>
<p>The Presidents of the WHAC Conference voted today at 5pm EST that <a href="http://www.whac.net/article/5306" target="_blank" rel="noopener">all spring sports will be cancelled</a>; including all games and practices. This decision was not taken lightly and I can&#8217;t even begin to imagine how hurt some of our spring sport athletes and coaches might feel.</p>
<p>I am holding office hours and am available if and when anyone wants to swing by my office in the arena. I know you have all heard from Dr. Stogner related to our plan to eliminate face-to-face instruction and transition to online learning, for now. Given that we are not moving forward with spring sports, I assume most of our residential students will move home for the time being. If you need to remain in the dorm you can.</p>
<p>Please know that we made a strong recommendation that the NAIA look into eligibility related to spring sport athletes that may or may not have competed in the minimum number of contests to constitute a season played.</p>
<p>Thanks for all you do in bringing goodwill to the University. You make us proud.</p>
<p>Dr. Klint Pleasant, Senior Vice President</p>

I hope this email finds you all well. Due to the Covid-19 virus, and in the interest and safety of potential students, faculty, and staff, we have decided to cancel the March 27 Warrior Day.<br />
We are closely watching the spread of the virus and suggestions from the CDC. At this time, we still plan to have our April 17 Warrior Day as scheduled. I will be sure to keep you all updated as we get closer to the April Warrior Day.</p>
<p>Thank you all for your commitment to our efforts to recruit new students to our institution.</p>

<p>Dear Students,<br />
As the situation related to COVID-19 continues to change with each passing hour, Rochester University remains committed to keeping abreast of the most current and accurate information and acting to protect the safety and health of our entire community.  Based upon that commitment, we have determined that we will take the following course of action:</p>
<ul>
<li>Beginning Monday, March 16 through at least Sunday, March 22, all seated, face-to-face and hybrid courses will be taught fully online.  You will be contacted by your instructors on a course-by-course basis with instructions on how to proceed. We will make a determination next week based on the best information available and will notify you about whether this practice will be extended beyond March 22.</li>
<li>We are working today to finalize a plan for how clinical course work will be managed for Nursing students and any other students with required clinical training.  Further and specific communication will be provided to those students in the next day or so.</li>
<li>Residence halls and the Fletcher Center Cafeteria will open as scheduled at the end of spring break.  However, we ask that for the time being, students remain at home and not return to campus unless it is a necessity that they be here.  We will follow the guidance and recommended protocols from local, state, and federal public health officials on serving meals, cleaning, and hygiene for all students who return to campus.</li>
<li>As of this writing, the NAIA and WHAC have determined that spring athletic seasons will continue as scheduled.  The RU athletic department and coaches will provide further updates as soon as they are available.</li>
</ul>
<p>I will reiterate that this situation continues to change rapidly.  Thus, please continue to carefully monitor your campus email, the RU app, and the RochesterU.edu website for the most accurate and timely information available.</p>
<p>Sincerely,<br />
Dr. Stogner</p>

<p>Dear Members of the Rochester University community,</p>
<p>Safeguarding the health and wellbeing of our campus community is our top priority. We have already taken several measures around campus to reduce germ spread by adding hand sanitation dispensers in high traffic areas as well as wiping door handles and light switches across campus daily. We are writing to share the latest guidelines and information as you prepare to return to campus.</p>
<p>At this time, all classes and events on campus are moving forward as normal. Please note that the situation can change quickly, and we will send out updates as we continue to monitor the situation.</p>
<p>If you are currently residing in an area where increased transmission of coronavirus is occurring, please take extra caution to practice good hygiene. In addition, we ask you to please seek medical attention and follow the doctor&#8217;s instructions if you begin feeling ill (fever and cough) and are concerned about the possibility of the flu or coronavirus.</p>
<p>The CDC recommends those who have traveled in areas (in the US or out of the country) with confirmed cases are strongly encouraged to stay home, self-quarantine and monitor your health for 14 days. Here is what you need to do if you need to self-quarantine:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you begin feeling ill (fever and cough) and are concerned about the possibility of the flu or coronavirus, please seek medical attention. Do not return to campus until you have been cleared by a doctor.
<ul>
<li><strong>Employees</strong> with questions about working arrangements during self-quarantining should contact their supervisor.</li>
<li><strong>Students</strong>, please provide a doctor&#8217;s note, indicating you are cleared to return to campus, to the Dean of Students via email (shays@rc.edu).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Students needing to self-quarantine on campus, please email residencelife@rc.edu to make alternative housing arrangements.</li>
<li>Students, please email your faculty to discuss possible options for remote classroom options and developing a plan to complete your course work.</li>
</ul>
<p>Once again, we would like to remind you to follow these simple everyday actions that can help prevent the spread of germs:</p>
<ul>
<li>Wash your hands often with soap and water for 20 seconds. If soap and water are not available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer.</li>
<li>CDC offers several free handwashing resources with information on <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/handwashing/when-how-handwashing.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">proper handwashing techniques</a>.</li>
<li>Cover your nose and mouth with a tissue when you cough or sneeze. Then throw the tissue in the trash.</li>
<li>Avoid close contact with people who are sick.</li>
<li>Obtain a flu vaccine since the flu season is still ongoing.</li>
<li>Clean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces.</li>
</ul>
<p>The leadership of RU is monitoring the situation closely and following the advice of the CDC and Oakland County Department of Public Health, along with the recommendations of the Michigan Governor&#8217;s office. We have organized a campus task force to continually monitor the situation and ensure that we take the most appropriate actions and precautions to protect the safety and health of our community. Some presumptive positive cases of coronavirus have now been diagnosed in Michigan, and additional steps may be taken to safeguard your health and well-being, including the cancellation or postponement of public events, or moving classes to an online forum. If such preventive measures must be put in place here on campus, we will communicate those updates as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>Thank you in advance for your efforts to help keep our campus community healthy and safe.</p>
<p>Brian L. Stogner, President<br />

<p>Dear RU Community,</p>
<p>The leadership at RU is continuing to closely monitor the ongoing spread of the coronavirus (COVID19) as well as follow the advice of the CDC and local health agencies. Although there continues to be a growing number of reported cases in the U.S., to date no cases have been reported in Oakland County or in the state of Michigan.</p>
<p>As we are heading into Spring Break and traveling we need to continue to take steps towards safeguarding the health and wellness of our community. If you are traveling out of the country or other states within the U.S. for the break please notify us at studentlife@rc.edu. In addition, continue to take everyday actions to help prevent the spread of any virus.<br />
As you are on break continue to take precautionary measures including:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you are feeling ill (fever and cough) towards the end of break, please stay home; you should not have a fever for at least 24 hours without having to take fever-reducing medications, before returning to campus.</li>
<li>Washing your hands often with soap and water for 20 seconds. If soap and water are not available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer.</li>
<li>CDC offers several free handwashing resources that include information on <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/handwashing/when-how-handwashing.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">proper handwashing technique</a>.</li>
<li>Covering your nose and mouth with a tissue when you cough or sneeze, then throwing the tissue in the trash.</li>
<li>Avoid close contact with people who are sick.</li>
<li>Obtain a flu vaccine since the flu season is still ongoing.</li>
<li>Clean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces</li>
</ul>
<p>The CDC also offers <a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/notices/warning/novel-coronavirus-china" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">specific guidance for travelers</a>.<br />
The University will continue to work with local, regional, state and national organizations to manage risks and concerns associated with this outbreak. Please know that if any illness prevention measures must be put in place here on our campus, we will communicate pertinent information as quickly as possible.<br />
Thank you in advance for your efforts to help keep our campus community healthy and safe.</div></div>

<p>Dear RU Community,</p>
<p>Rochester University is committed to supporting your health and wellness especially during flu season and the recent development of the 2019 Novel Coronavirus which originated in Wuhan, China.</p>
<p>Although there have been a number of reported cases in the U.S., to date no cases have been reported in Oakland County or in the state of Michigan.  We want to assure you that University administration is closely monitoring the situation.</p>
<p>We do need to be cautious, however, as we would regarding any communicable illness. Our best way to prevent infection is to avoid being exposed to the virus. The simple everyday actions you can take to help prevent the spread of flu and the common cold will also help prevent the spread of coronaviruses.</p>
<p>According to the Centers for Disease Control, these include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Washing your hands often with soap and water for 20 seconds, and help young children do the same. If soap and water are not available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer.</li>
<li>Covering your nose and mouth with a tissue when you cough or sneeze, then throwing the tissue in the trash.</li>
<li>Avoid close contact with people who are sick.</li>
<li>Stay home when you are sick.</li>
<li>Cleaning and disinfecting frequently touched surfaces</li>
</ul>
<p>The CDC also offers <a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/notices/warning/novel-coronavirus-china" target="_blank" rel="noopener">specific guidance for travelers</a>.<br />
Please know that if any illness prevention measures must be put in place here on our campus, we will communicate pertinent information as quickly as possible.<br />
Thank you in advance for your efforts to help keep our campus community healthy and safe.</div></div>
