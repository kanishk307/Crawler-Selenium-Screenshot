Residential students will receive a prorated refund of their unused
                              meal plan prior to the end of the current spring semester. A housing credit, in the
                              form of an additional grant, will be applied for the 2020-2021 academic year. Graduating
                              seniors will receive a refund of both room and board prior to the end of the spring
                              2020 semester. Students were emailed details about their proration on April 10. The
                              Business Office will begin to issue refunds the week of April 24. Contact <strong><a href="mailto:businessoffice@defiance.edu">businessoffice@defiance.edu</a></strong> or 419-793-2550 with questions.</span></p>

                        <p><strong>Can I get my belongings from my residence hall room?</strong><br><span style="font-size: 12pt;">For the safety of everyone concerned, we will structure the move-out process in a
                              way that limits the number of people in the residence halls at any given time. We
                              will do an official move-out process after the semester ends in May. If you are within
                              driving distance of the college, you will be permitted to return to campus to move
                              out beginning April 6, 2020. If you are not within driving distance, you can continue
                              to leave your belongings here until the semester ends in May. <strong>Please read your email for specific directions and guidelines.</strong> We are doing all the right things to keep your belongings safe. We will keep the
                              rooms locked. The Hall Directors are still in residence and security is doing rounds
                              through each floor on every shift.</span></p>
                        
                        <p><strong>When is the official move-out process for the residence halls?</strong><br><span style="font-size: 12pt;">The semester ends on May 7th. Our expectation is that all students must be completely
                              moved-out of their current room by Sunday, May 10th unless staying in their same room

                              removing all items from your room or having your items packed, stored, and/or shipped.
                              As per our policies, additional housing charges will be applied for students who do
                              not move-out or store their belongings by May 10th. <strong>Please read the email from Dean Marsalek for specific directions, guidelines, and

                        <p><strong>Are offices and buildings open?</strong><br><span style="font-size: 12pt;">The College will continue to function during normal business hours (mailroom is open
                              10:00 a.m. - noon, M-F). Most offices are working remotely, but are still available
                              to assist you as needed. You can continue to use the same phone numbers and email
                              addresses to reach faculty and staff. Since there is only an extremely limited number
                              of faculty, staff, and students on campus, nearly all of the <strong>campus buildings are closed</strong>. A campus-issued key card will be needed to enter most buildings.</span></p>

                              through June 30, 2020. We will continue to monitor the situation and will make decisions
                              regarding July and August camps and clinics at the appropriate time.</span></p>
                        
                        <p><strong>Should I return to campus?<br></strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>For your safety, and the safety of others, DO NOT return to campus</strong>.

                        <p><strong>What about my student work study employment?<br></strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Most on-campus student employment was suspended on March 17 as our faculty and staff
                              transition to working remotely. There are a few offices that will still need workers
                              (ex. tutors, residence life). If your position can continue, you will be contacted
                              directly.</span></p>
                        
                        <p><strong>I'm concerned about my ability to learn online. How is DC making sure I will be educated
                              at a high level?<br></strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Tutoring is still available but now delivered online. Writing consultations, math
                              tutoring, and supplemental instruction have also moved online. Please read emails
                              from Vice President for Academic Affairs Agnes Caldwell for more details on tutoring
                              and student support services. Our faculty went through training to ensure that their
                              online teaching presents students with the same high-quality education they would
                              receive in the classroom. Students are in a virtual "classroom." This will help maintain,
                              as much as possible, a normal learning environment.</span></p>

                                       pm yesterday and is in effect through at least 11:59 pm April 6. As a result of this,
                                       we will not be able to resume face-to-face classes on April 6 as we originally planned.
                                       Therefore, <b>we will continue with remote learning for the remainder of the semester.</b> As a liberal arts based institution, we value the personal connections that happen
                                       on-campus and in the classroom; however, the safety of our students, faculty, staff,
                                       and the greater community must come first. As we continue to monitor the situation,
                                       our efforts to support containment are because we understand it is effective. We know
                                       this decision raises many questions about how things will work moving forward. Here
                                       are some of the answers we have right now and we will continue to communicate additional
                                       information as we have it.</span></p>

                                       to stay during the remote learning period. ID access was turned off last Thursday
                                       for all other students. We request that students who are currently still on campus

                                       For out-of-state students who are not within driving distance, we can arrange to store

                                    <li>As we would do during any extended break, we will begin safety checks of each room
                                       now that we know we are going to remain online for the rest of the semester. We will

                                       to Defiance College. Many of you are expressing concerns about how this virus could
                                       impact our campus. Let me begin by reassuring you that<strong> there are no known cases of COVID-19 on campus or affecting any member of the campus
                                          community</strong>.</span></p>
                                 
                                 <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">The Defiance College leadership team takes the health and safety of our campus community
                                       very seriously. This is why I have convened an emergency management team to ensure
                                       that we remain one step ahead. Our leadership team and the task force are continually
                                       monitoring the COVID-19 situation. We are routinely checking the <strong><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/" target="_blank">Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)</a></strong> for updated information as well as staying in contact with local health agencies.
                                       We are also using resources available to us from the <strong><a href="https://www.naicu.edu/" target="_blank">National Association of Independent Colleges and Universities (NAICU)</a></strong>, the <strong><a href="http://www.aicuo.edu/" target="_blank">Association of Independent Colleges and Universities in Ohio (AICUO)</a></strong>, and other official sources to help inform and guide our decision-making process.</span></p>
                                 
                                 <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Governor Mike DeWine has issued a state of emergency in Ohio. Based on the recommendations
                                       from Governor DeWine's office, the following will be taking effect for Defiance College:</span></p>
                                 
                                 <ul>
                                    
                                    <li>Defiance College will resume classes in a 100%-online format beginning on March 18.
                                       This date extends spring break by two additional days. Current plans are to resume
                                       face-to-face classes after April 3, pending any changes warranted by the situation.

                                    <li>All student teachers, students in social work program placements, and students in
                                       field placements or internships should continue to report to their sites unless otherwise
                                       instructed.
                                    </li>
                                    
                                    <li>All in-season team sports will be competing as scheduled. Teams that are not in-season
                                       will be suspending activities until further notice.
                                    </li>
                                    
                                    <li>Residence halls will remain open for all residential students. Dining services will
                                       resume on March 17 with the evening meal.
                                    </li>
                                    
                                    <li>All Defiance College offices will remain open with regularly scheduled hours.</li>
                                    
                                    <li>Individual visits are still welcome; however, if you are showing symptoms of sickness,
                                       we ask that you please reschedule your visit. Overnight visits and large group visits
                                       are canceled. <strong><a href="/information/directory.html">Please consult your coach or the Admissions Office for more details</a></strong><span>.</span></li>

                                 <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Currently, campus is on spring break. While a large portion of students and faculty
                                       are away, we are taking this time to deep clean and disinfect all campus buildings
                                       and residence halls. Upon return, the College community will find an increase in the
                                       availability of hand sanitizer and disinfecting wipes. Our cleaning staff will continue
                                       to take extra precautions throughout the semester.</span></p>

                                       coronavirus (COVID-19) and will update you as needed. The campus is being deep cleaned
                                       and disinfected during spring break and we will continue to take extra precautions
                                       throughout the semester. There is an increase in the availability of hand sanitizer
                                       and disinfectant wipes. If needed, we have a preparedness plan in place should the
                                       virus come to campus or Defiance county. The College continues to work closely with

                                       by COVID-19.

                                 <p><strong>STRATEGIES FOR SUCCESS<br></strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>MAINTAIN A CONSISTENT SCHEDULE</strong><br>Developing and maintaining a routine is important for success. Try to:<br>• Wake up and go to bed at consistent times each day.<br>• Schedule specific blocks of time each day to work on classes and assignments.<br>• Schedule time for healthy habits (exercise, eating healthy foods, time with family
                                       and friends).<br><br><strong>REMEMBER TO TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF</strong><br>Take it day by day and do the best you can to help yourself and others. Regular exercise
                                       to manage stress is important and so is getting adequate rest/sleep and maintaining
                                       good nutrition. If you have any risk factors or family care demands, try to arrange
                                       ways to work from home doing phone triage, follow-up, etc. I f you are moving to remote
                                       work, set up boundaries so you can maintain personal time and space. Curb how much
                                       news you watch daily and take some time to decompress. Check in with a friend, colleague,
                                       or family member through phone, text, etc.<br><br><strong>SELF-CARE VERSUS AVOIDANCE</strong><br>Self-care is important but sometimes we can disguise avoidance to look like self-care.
                                       An example of self-care: scheduling 30-60 minutes to watch your favorite TV; meanwhile,
                                       avoidance would be binge-watching an entire season of your favorite show when a paper
                                       is due.</span></p>

                                 <p><strong>What is novel coronavirus?<br></strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;">The 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19), commonly known as a coronavirus, is
                                       a virus identified as the cause of an outbreak of respiratory illness first detected
                                       in Wuhan, China. While the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) considers
                                       this a serious public health concern, based on current information, the immediate
                                       health risk from a coronavirus to the general American public is considered low at
                                       this time. For additional information, <strong><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/about/index.html" target="_blank">visit the CDC website</a></strong>.</span></p>
                                 
                                 <p><strong>What are the symptoms?<br></strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Similar to the common cold and influenza, symptoms of the coronavirus include fever,
                                       cough, and shortness of breath. The CDC believes that symptoms may appear in as few
                                       as 2 days or up to 14 days after exposure. Reported cases have ranged from mild illness
                                       (similar to a common cold) to severe pneumonia that requires hospitalization.</span></p>
                                 
                                 <p><strong>How is it spread?<br></strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;">COVID-19 is primarily spread through respiratory droplets. To become infected, people
                                       generally must be within six feet of someone who is contagious and come into contact
                                       with these droplets. Health experts are still learning the details about how this
                                       new coronavirus spreads.</span></p>
