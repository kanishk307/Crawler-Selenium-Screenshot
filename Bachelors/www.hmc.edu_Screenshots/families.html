	  	<p><strong>Q:</strong> When are students supposed to leave at the end of the semester? Are students allowed to travel over the Thanksgiving break? Are students allowed to stay on campus through final exams?</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"><strong>A:</strong> If you choose to leave campus for the Thanksgiving break, you will not be allowed to return to campus until the start of the spring term. Final assessments for all students will be given  remotely.  We believe that this measure is necessary for the safety of our community. Thanksgiving is one the busiest times for travel in the U.S., and the risk of students potentially being exposed to COVID-19 while traveling back and forth to campus is too great for us to allow them to return after they leave. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We encourage students and their families to consider carefully whether they would like to return home for the holiday this year. We are allowing students to stay on campus through the end of the fall term. However, students who elect to go home for the holiday—even if they live in Southern California—will not be allowed to return to campus and will need to complete their exams remotely. We are happy to have our students remain on campus during Thanksgiving if they would like to take their exams on campus. </span><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Students who do choose to leave November 24 will receive a room and board credit on their student account for the days not used (the time period from November 25 through December 4, the end of the semester). This will be reflected on their statement dated December 31.</span></p>

	  	<p><strong>Q:</strong> I am an International student. What happens to my visa if I choose to take a semester or year off?</p>
<p><strong>Incoming Students:</strong> If you choose to defer admittance to HMC for a year, your visa will not be impacted as you have not received one. You will not be allowed to get your visa until you attend HMC. Your SEVIS record will reflect a new start date and you will need to be issued a new I-20 or DS-2019 to show at your consular appointment.</p>
<p><strong>Returning Students:</strong> If you choose to take a semester off please be mindful of the expiration date of your current visa. If your visa expires prior to your return to campus you WILL need to apply for a new one. If you are in the USA and choose to take a semester off, you will need to leave the country as you will not be in status.</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> I am an International student. What happens to my SEVIS record if I choose to take a semester or year off?</p>
<p><strong>Incoming Students:</strong> If you submit your paperwork to the ISS, a SEVIS record will be created when all the required documents are received. If you choose to attend at a later date the program start date of your SEVIS record will be pushed back to reflect your new start date. This will preserve your I-901 fee if it has already been paid. Upon your return, you will need to submit new documentation before a new I-20 or DS-2019 is sent to you for your consular appointment.</p>
<p><strong>Returning Students:</strong> If you choose to take some time away from Mudd, your SEVIS record will be terminated for Early Authorized Withdrawal. Please keep in mind that this may affect your ability to participate in CPT, OPT and AT. For F-1 students: If you plan to return within 5 months of the date of termination, there may be a possibility to reactivate your SEVIS record. If you do not return within the 5 month window, you will need to get a new SEVIS record and your employment clock will restart and you will need to be enrolled for 9 months (one academic school year) before you are eligible for CPT/OPT again. For J-1 students: you will need to get a new SEVIS record, there is no ability to reinstate your previous record. You will need to submit new documentation before a new I-20 or DS-2019 can be issued to you. If your visa will still be valid when you return, then you will not need to apply for a new one; a valid visa is a valid visa.</p>

We will not offer every course in this format and make no guarantees that all courses necessary to each student’s progress will be available online. Students are encouraged to contact the Associate Dean of Academic Affairs or the Associate Dean of Academic Resources and Student Success with questions.

	  	<p><strong>Q:</strong> What are the consequences to students when they are found breaking safety rules? (As we all know, teenagers and young adults they will like to push boundaries, they have already been away for a long time and have lot of stress, anxiety, and would want to meet up with their friends, go for a late night run etc. etc.)</p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> This was discussed in one of the “Inside Mudd” parent’s panels. We will be working on norming practices for students to help build a culture of how to manage this situation, and reporting options. Students who do not comply will be asked to leave-campus (cannot live on-campus) for the safety of self and others.</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> How will we enforce these safety measures?</p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> We outline that in the FAQ. First this is about safety. We will engage with students and utilize the Honor Code and the res life teams will be key in this as well. Living on campus and making that choice means you have to decide that you need to live within these boundaries and rules for your own safety and the safety of others.</p>

	  	<p><strong>Q:</strong> What will HMC do to support students’ mental health under these unusual circumstances this fall?</p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> The effects of COVID-19 and the way it has changed how we live and work as a nation have been significant for all of us. HMC is committed to the health and well-being of our community. Students will continue to have access to virtual health and well-being resources. We anticipate Student Health Services (SHS) and Monsour Counseling and Psychiatric Services (MCAPS) will be open for students for both in-person and virtual appointments, in addition to continuing the <a href="https://www.timely.md/higher-education/?gclid=EAIaIQobChMItqPVvKin6gIVvxitBh3cdwzFEAAYASAAEgKTRfD_BwE">TimelyMD telehealth services</a> and MIResource that were implemented this past spring for students. The Division of Student Affairs (DSA) will continue to provide student engagement opportunities (such as Muchachos events, Office of Institutional Diversity (OID) webinars, Wellness YouTube activities) for students in a virtual format this fall, and will continue to reassess in-person activities as <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1kLLnTMYVB6ceAoTbAEi3RRUt72dJxvcz">guidance and mandates</a> evolve. Additionally, we have been working hard to create a plan to safely re-open the Linde Activities Center (LAC) for students to have access to physical activities and exercise.</p>

<p><strong>A:</strong> Online courses offer us the greatest opportunities for flexibility and safety. An online only course can serve HMC students on campus, cross-registrants, and possibly even HMC students who are not able to return to campus. These courses also are well-suited for students who may need to self-quarantine for some time during the semester, and offer a safe teaching assignment to faculty members who may be particularly vulnerable to COVID-19. But we will only assign courses to this designation where we are confident that we can continue to meet core learning objectives successfully.</p>

<p><strong>Q:</strong> What support will the students who are staying off campus receive from Mudd faculty and how the online learning with remote learners can be facilitated?</p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> Plan to model this very similarly to how the spring semester was delivered. HMC also had a robust summer courses offering and additional learning was realized during those courses to better facilitate online learning. Tutoring and grutoring will be available online as well as the Academic Excellence (AE) office and The Writing Center. Faculty will have online office hours by appointment and group meetings. Faculty office hours actually had better attendance in the spring semester as an online offering than in person office hours earlier in the year. Very popular with students.</p>

	  	<p><strong>Q:</strong> What happens when a student has been diagnosed with COVID-19? What happens when a student thinks they have COVID-19? What happens if a student thinks they have been exposed to COVID-19?</p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> If a student believes they may have COVID-19 or if they are experiencing signs and symptoms, they should immediately isolate and contact Student Health Services at <a href="tel:+19096218222">909.621.8222</a> or Campus Safety after hours at <a href="tel:+19096072000">909.607.2000</a>. If a student has been diagnosed with COVID-19, they should inform the Division of Student Affairs (DSA) of the positive test ASAP by calling <a href="tel:+19096218125">909.621.8125</a> or emailing <a href="mai&#108;&#116;o&#58;&#100;&#101;an_o&#102;&#95;stude&#110;ts&#64;h&#109;c.&#101;&#100;u">&#100;e&#97;n_&#111;f&#95;s&#116;u&#100;&#101;n&#116;&#115;&#64;&#104;m&#99;.ed&#117;</a>.</p>
<p>Isolation is used to separate people infected with the virus from people who are not infected. Students who are in isolation should remain until it’s safe for them to be around others. DSA will help coordinate isolation for the student as well as meals, coursework and other needs while in isolation. Contact tracing will be conducted to determine what other community members may have had contact with someone who has tested positive for COVID-19 and any individuals who have been identified as close contacts (defined as having close (within 6.6 ft) and prolonged (generally more than 30 minutes) contact with a person displaying symptoms of COVID-19) will be instructed to quarantine.</p>
<p>If a student believes they have been exposed to COVID-19, they should immediately begin quarantine procedures and contact Student Health Services at <a href="tel:+19096218222">909.621.8222</a> or Campus Safety after hours at <a href="tel:+19096072000">909.607.2000</a>. Quarantine is used to keep someone who might have been exposed to COVID-19 away from others to help prevent spread of disease that can occur before a person knows they are sick or if they are infected with the virus without feeling symptoms. DSA will help coordinate quarantine for the student as well as meals, coursework and other needs while in quarantine.</p>
<p>Students experiencing any of the following symptoms should contact Campus Safety at <a href="tel:+19096072000">909.607.2000</a> immediately:</p>
<ul>
<li>Difficulty breathing</li>
<li>Pressure or pain in chest</li>
<li>Blueish face or lips</li>
<li>Confused or hard to wake</li>
<li>Other serious symptoms</li>
</ul>
<p>For more information, please review <a href="http://publichealth.lacounty.gov/acd/ncorona2019/covidisolation/">LA County&#8217;s Home Isolation Instructions for People with COVID-19</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> What will the exact (or near exact) restrictions/availability of resources be when a student is sick?</p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> Since the vast majority of students are not covered by the Student Health Insurance Program (SHIP) they should establish a relationship with a health care provider in this area (search zip code 91711 on their provider’s website) PRIOR to arriving on campus. Making sure that the health care provider is accepting new patients. All students, whether covered by SHIP or not, have access to the Student Health Services (SHS) of The Claremont Colleges Services (TCCS). Testing of symptomatic students will be available at SHS. It is unclear at this time if an adequate number of tests will be available to proactively test all students.</p>

      <div class="card-body p-2">
	  	<p><strong>Q:</strong> Will COVID-19 testing be available on campus?</p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> We anticipate testing being available through Student Health Services for students who are experiencing symptoms of COVID-19. Faculty and staff who are experiencing symptoms should contact their health care provider to discuss whether testing is necessary. Students who are experiencing symptoms should self-isolate and not attend any in-person classes or other activities until they have been cleared to do so. Faculty and staff who are experiencing symptoms should NOT report to campus for work and should contact their direct supervisor.</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> How readily available will coronavirus tests be? Will all students, staff, and faculty be tested before the start of classes? How often will we all be tested?</p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> Right now, the advice (Read <a href="https://www.hmc.edu/coronavirus-information/wp-content/uploads/sites/61/2020/06/ACHA_COVID-19_Testing_June-3-2020.pdf">ACHA COVID-19 Testing: What We Know as of June 3, 2020 (PDF)</a> and <a href="https://www.hmc.edu/coronavirus-information/wp-content/uploads/sites/61/2020/06/LACOPH_GuidanceTestingStrategy.pdf">LAOCPH COVID-19 Testing Strategy (PDF)</a> guidance) is not to test students at the start of term and not to test until someone exhibits symptoms or has come into direct contact with someone who has tested positive. Due to shortage of testing nationally, we believe this is more of an equity issue in that if colleges and universities over-consume available tests, it leaves fewer for the people who really are more vulnerable. Our plan, assuming we are able to have students on campus and based on advice from medical experts, is doing daily symptom checks for everyone who is on campus. It is possible there will be some campuses that decide to test every student despite medical advice, but we are not planning to do that.</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> Will Student Health Services charge a fee for COVID-19 testing?</p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> Student Health Services will not charge students to test for COVID-19. However they are reserving tests for symptomatic individuals.</p>

	  	<p><strong>Q:</strong> What are the expectations for students to follow the health &amp; safety protocols?</p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> Students who make the choice to come back to campus this fall will be expected to follow specific COVID-19 protocols and policies for their safety and for the safety of the larger HMC community. These protocols and policies will be clearly outlined for all students prior to their return, and students will sign a document acknowledging these protocols and policies prior to being permitted to move into the residence halls or begin classes on campus.</p>
<p>The HMC Honor Code states that students are expected to act as responsible individuals, to conduct themselves with honesty and integrity both personally and academically and to respect the rights of others. The College considers these standards to be essential to our ability to physically reopen this fall. Students who violate the COVID-19 protocols and policies will be subject to a student conduct process. This will be true for HMC students who have been alleged to violate other 7C College policies, as the HMC Honor Code also expects that students will exhibit “responsible behavior both on and off campus”.</p>
<p>Students who behave in a way that presents a substantial risk of harm to self and/or others may be subject to the involuntary leave process as outlined in the <a href="http://catalog.hmc.edu/content.php?catoid=15&amp;navoid=762#leave-of-absence-withdrawal-and-readmission-policy">Leave of Absence, Withdrawal, and Readmission Policy</a>.</p>

Additionally, staff will be assigned to continually sanitize common use areas throughout campus such as tables and chairs in our dining facilities, handrails, stairwells, restrooms, and elevators to disinfect these high traffic high touch areas. While cleaning, staff will follow social distance protocols and wear the appropriate personal protective equipment.

<p>Students will be required to remain on campus except for “essential purposes” such as doctor visits, therapists, pharmacies, curbside pickup, and groceries.

As we did last spring, the College will closely follow the guidance of state and county public health officials in making any determination about closures. In the event we are forced to send students home, we would anticipate following a similar procedure to that followed last spring, pausing instruction briefly and providing students and families with as much notice as possible regarding the transition to online-only coursework and issuing room and board refunds as appropriate. </span></p>

	  	<p><strong>Q:</strong> Does the July 10 deadline to decide if coming back to campus mean we are required to pay room even if things change before the move-in date which would cause our student to not be able to move on campus?</p>
<p><strong>A:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>All students expected to be enrolled for FA20 already have fall semester charges posted to their student account as of July 1.
<ul>
<li>If the student is on the monthly payment plan, their first installment is due by July 20</li>
<li>If the student is on the full payment plan, their payment is due by August 20.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If college housing is not an option later due to campus closure by county health or state mandate, the room and board charge would be credited at that time. Otherwise, students are still expected to pay under the normal contract dates specified above.</li>
<li>If the student opts to cancel their housing contract after July 15, they would be responsible for the $300 cancellation fee.</li>
<li>If the student is on the monthly payment plan, they are required to pay their first installment by July 20. Delinquent accounts are subject to a 1% late fee.</li>
<li>For returning students, as indicated in the housing contract, the cancellation fee is applicable if the student terminates their housing contract after participating in draw and prior to the start of the contract period.</li>
<li>Cancellation by the student after the contract period is at the discretion and approval of the student’s petition cancellation petition due to a documented personal hardship or unforeseeable extenuating circumstance.</li>
</ul>
<p>Ultimately, we want students to make their housing decision based on what they are comfortable with and what is the safest for them. We are trying to balance that with our need to know that decision far enough in advance to plan a smooth and safe move-in for those who choose that option and so that we can budget the resources necessary to make this possible.</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> My daughter has heard rumors that school might be moving students rooms who are returning to campus. She is living in a single in a suite, and is basing part of her return decision on living in that room with her current suitemates. If they decide to move students and she is not happy with her rooming situation, is she able to change her mind and stay home without financial repercussions?</p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> Cancelation should occur prior to the start of the contract period: August 22 for new students and August 23 for returning students. Also, students who cancel prior to the start of the housing contract period, there is a $300 cancellation fee.</p>

	  	<p><strong>Q:</strong> When can I move in on campus?</p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> Information about the fall move-in process is below. Also, we want to help you think about your travel plans should you decide to return. As a reminder, if you are in a position to let us know whether you 1) intend to live on campus and be available to participate in in-person classes; 2) study remotely; or 3) apply for a leave of absence/defer, by the original deadline of July 10, that will be incredibly helpful in making sure we can secure the necessary resources. If you need a little more time, we ask that you complete the <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSePsxEF044TbRF2E9YmjccIwj_uzNfhCe3k68t2y2jTEJD7JA/viewform?usp=sf_link" rel="noopener noreferrer">HMC Fall 2020 Enrollment Confirmation &amp; Housing Reservation Form</a> no later than July 15.</p>
<h4>Making Travel Arrangements</h4>
<p>We recommend that you do not purchase flights or make travel arrangements until July 20 at the earliest. We will be assessing how many students will be living on campus and assigning move-in times based on this information, which we will be unable to do before July 15.</p>
<p>When purchasing flights and making travel arrangements, we suggest that you select options that are refundable. While HMC is making preparations to re-open this fall, the LA County Department of Public Health has not yet approved the reopening of higher education institutions. California is still in the early stages of <a title="https://covid19.ca.gov/roadmap/#top" href="https://covid19.ca.gov/roadmap/#top" rel="noopener noreferrer">Phase 2 of its re-opening plan</a>, and in recent days, we have seen a concerning trend in Los Angeles County of <a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/COVID19CountyDataTable.aspx" rel="noopener noreferrer">increasing infection rates and hospitalizations</a>. We do not have an estimate of when we will hear from the LA County Department of Public Health, and it is possible that they may tell us we are not approved to re-open later in the summer after you have already made travel arrangements.</p>
<h4>Move-in Days</h4>
<p>As of now, here are anticipated move-in days:</p>
<ul>
<li>Thursday, August 20: Student Leaders (Proctors, Mentors, Head Mentors, NISSO Mentors, SI Mentors, and select members of ASHMC)</li>
<li>Friday, August 21: SI students and new international students</li>
<li>Saturday, August 22: New students</li>
<li>Sunday, August 23: Returning students</li>
</ul>
<p>All students will be permitted three (3) hours to move-in and may have one (1) person to help them move-in to their residence hall room. Any helper(s) will also be expected to follow COVID-19 policies and protocols and will need to leave campus at the end of the designated three hours.</p>
<h4>New Students</h4>
<p>Due to various program designs, all new students (including SI students and new international students) will be assigned move-in times in the order of arrival of their respective programs.</p>
<h4>Returning Students</h4>
<p>Returning students will have the opportunity to sign up for move-in time slots based on reduced capacity per building. As of now, we are anticipating four (4) time periods (7–10 a.m., 11 a.m.–2 .p.m, 3–6 p.m., and 7–10 p.m.) from which upperclass students can choose. We will be determining the number of students who are able to move-in on a per building basis, with no more than 25% capacity during each time period. Additionally, if you have a roommate, we will be asking you to move-in at different times. While we are working on the details of this process still, we anticipate that we will have slightly different protocols for suites. After we know how many students will be on campus, we will communicate more details about the move-in times and process.</p>
<h4>Special Circumstances</h4>
<p>While we are asking you to prepare for more strict arrival and move-in regulations, we will work with people who have extraordinary circumstances (such as international students with limited flight availability) regarding move-in times. Students who have extraordinary circumstances should complete this <a href="https://forms.gle/hBRcf4heXbdZmaPCA" rel="noopener noreferrer">Move-in time change request for returning students form</a> to request a new move-in time.</p>
<h4>Storage Pods</h4>
<p>More information to come! Please know that we will work with students that choose not to return to campus for the fall semester or entire academic year to continue storing their belongings for them.</p>
<p>We will continue adding questions and answers to this page that will be helpful for you.</p>
<h4>Move-in Shopping by Families</h4>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> On move in day will families be allowed to leave campus to purchase necessities for the residence hall, and deliver them to their student?</p>
<p><strong>A: </strong>Our main goal is to keep students and their families safe, so we need to limit exposure once students and families arrive to campus. With that in mind, we ask that you bring all your move-in supplies with you before getting on campus for your designated move-in time. The mail room will be open in case you forgot something and need to mail it to students. Information about room dimensions, a packing list, and other helpful information about the residence halls can be found on the <a href="https://www.hmc.edu/student-life/orientation/dorm-faqs/">Residence Hall Information</a> page on our website.</p>
<p>This year, we will be sending students a specific packing list over the summer that includes items needed for COVID-19 policies and hygiene practices, as well as some suggestions of items students may wish to bring to enjoy time outside since our physical space will look different.</p>
<h4>Move-in Quarantine</h4>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> What will the two-week quarantine look like?</p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> A full quarantine in the sense that students will be in their residence halls with very limited contact with others, food delivery, mail delivery, outside scheduled exercise, no mass gatherings of any sort.</p>
<h4>Grocery Shopping During Quarantine</h4>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> Students who stay on campus and do not have meal plans or have very reduced meal plans, how will they be accommodated as they will be making grocery runs (and so will have exposure to others)?</p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> During the two-week quarantine, students will not be able to go to the grocery store. It will be a true quarantine and we will ask students to utilize the delivery systems available to them.</p>

	  	<p><strong>Q:</strong> When will New Student Orientation start?</p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> Most of New Student Orientation (NSO) will take place virtually over the summer months. New students will be connected to student leaders, called Mentors, who will guide them through the online orientation program. There will be a NSO program that adheres to social distancing regulations beginning right after move-in on Saturday, August 22 and continuing through Sunday, August 23. More details will be communicated over the summer to incoming students via the Orientation Student Newsletter and the Orientation website. We hope to have a welcoming experience which can help new students get to know Mudd, while keeping everybody as safe as possible.</p>

This year Summer Institute will begin in late July with online modules and mentor group meetings. The on-campus portion of the program will also be adjusted. As dates become available, we will notify participants via their hmc email so they may continue to plan their arrival to campus.</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> Will International Students Orientation be cancelled?</p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> New International Student and Scholar Orientation (NISSO) will not be cancelled. The Office of Institutional Diversity is working hard to provide an online orientation for students followed by a socially distant on-campus orientation on Saturday, August 22 after their move-in on Friday, August 21</p>

	  	<p><strong>Q:</strong> Can my partner visit me in my residence hall? What about other guests and family? Will 7C students be able to come to HMC?</p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> For the fall, no guests will be permitted to visit on campus, which unfortunately includes fellow students from the other Claremont Colleges. However, an exception will be made for one person who may help students move-in during their assigned time slot in August.</p>
<p>We realize this will have serious implications on students&#8217; social lives, and are working on ways to make sure students can still be a part of an active community. For example, there will be outdoor covered common spaces that we will create as alternatives for students wishing to spend socially distanced time together to study and work collaboratively.</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> Can students visit each other in dorm rooms?</p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> We have different outdoor spaces in the residence hall communities where students can visit. We will begin by not allowing students to visit each other in rooms and will revise that as we are able to.</p>

These students who will be participating in Remote Learning should work with the Academic Deans (<a href="&#109;ail&#116;o:a&#99;&#97;&#100;&#101;&#109;&#105;c&#100;&#101;a&#110;&#115;-l&#64;&#103;&#46;hmc.&#101;du">a&#99;a&#100;e&#109;i&#99;&#100;&#101;ans-l&#64;&#103;.hmc.&#101;&#100;&#117;</a>) to review their course schedule and discuss whether courses will be accessible in an online format. Students should be aware that some required courses, including labs, may have in-person components which are not able to be offered in an online format.</p>
<p>Students choosing to live away from campus and participate in Remote Learning due to underlying health conditions are encouraged to register with <a href="https://www.hmc.edu/ability">HMC’s Student Accessibility Services</a> through the AIM Portal or speak with Dean Amy Bibbens (<a href="&#109;a&#105;lto&#58;&#97;&#98;&#105;&#98;be&#110;s&#64;g.&#104;m&#99;&#46;e&#100;&#117;">abib&#98;e&#110;&#115;&#64;g.h&#109;&#99;&#46;&#101;du</a>).</p>
<h4>Off-campus Living and Financial Aid</h4>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> If students choose to stay off campus, will they adversely be impacted by financial aid or housing in Spring?</p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> If a student chooses to live off campus their cost of attendance will change and their need-based financial aid will be adjusted accordingly. We prefer each student to reach out to Financial Aid directly at <a href="&#109;a&#105;&#108;to&#58;&#102;in&#97;n&#99;i&#97;&#108;&#95;&#97;i&#100;&#64;&#104;&#109;&#99;.edu">&#102;ina&#110;cia&#108;&#95;&#97;i&#100;&#64;hmc&#46;e&#100;u</a> as every student’s financial situation is different.

	  	<p><strong>Q:</strong> What will be the College’s response to students who violate the “visitation” rules for HMC’s campus? What about the other campuses?</p>
<p><strong>A: </strong>The College considers these standards to be essential to our ability to physically reopen this fall. The policies exist because we think it’s the only way for us to be able to open, so it’s important to make sure that they are followed.</p>
<p>If students feel like they cannot abide by the policies and protocols, they have the opportunity to make an active choice not to return this fall. Students, staff and faculty in our community all have different circumstances and backgrounds, and we hope to provide a stable, safe environment without putting people at risk.</p>
<p>If a student gets sick, the most important thing is for us to connect them with healthcare and mitigate risk to the rest of the community. Because of this, when a student tests positive for COVID-19, a member of the contact tracing committee will reach out and ask questions about individuals you may have had contact with during the incubation phase of your sickness. The contact tracing committee is not responsible for Honor Code or COVID-19 Policy enforcement, and will be focused on public health, not student conduct enforcement. This is always a public health issue first, and students will be encouraged to honestly report contact with community members, regardless of if they were following COVID-19 Policies.</p>
<p>Our expectation is that those who actively choose to return to the residential campus environment will keep each other accountable and safe. The Student Advisory Board and the DSA are still working together on determining how violations will be handled from a student conduct perspective. We respect the Honor Code at HMC and we recognize that it is important for students to be transparent about their social activities for the purposes of contact tracing. Thus, this sentiment will be taken into consideration when determining sanctions for students who come forward with an unprompted self report regarding COVID-19 policies. We will focus on working with the student first and ensuring everybody on campus is staying safe and healthy. However, in the case of repeated violations, the school will take action to make sure we can maintain the safety of the community. In extreme circumstances, students who continue to violate policies, despite warnings, may be subject to the involuntary leave of absence process as outlined in the <a href="http://catalog.hmc.edu/content.php?catoid=15&amp;navoid=762#leave-of-absence-withdrawal-and-readmission-policy">Leave of Absence, Withdrawal, and Readmission Policy</a>.</p>
