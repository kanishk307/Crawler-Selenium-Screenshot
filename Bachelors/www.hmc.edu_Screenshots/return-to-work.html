			<h1 id="content-title">Guide  for Faculty, Staff and Student Employees  Returning to Campus</h1>
						
			
			<div class="document-layout">
<p>This guide is for faculty, staff and students who are employed in some capacity at Harvey Mudd. Students who are not employed should refer to the student information section.</p>
<h2>From the President</h2>
<p>Harvey Mudd College was founded less than a month before the Sputnik I launch initiated the Space Race, making technical education a priority in the United States. The founders’ vision—to attract the nation’s brightest students and offer them a rigorous scientific and technological education coupled with a strong curricular emphasis in the humanities, social sciences and the arts—has been successfully realized and expanded.</p>
<p>Today, in the wake of the COVID-19 global pandemic, our place in higher education as the liberal arts college of STEM has never been more crucial. <span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, more than ever, the world needs leaders in science, engineering and mathematics who understand the impact of their work on society—leaders who grasp the fundamental importance of collaboration in ensuring the world can recover and flourish. We also realize that until a reliable vaccine is developed and made available worldwide, COVID-19 will remain a part of our lives. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is our new normal. </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is no return to life before the pandemic—at least not until a viable vaccine is found and delivered worldwide. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">We must adapt</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Only through collaboration and remaining steadfast in our commitment to continuing our educational mission, have we been able to identify our path forward.</span></p>
<p>We are a community of lifelong learners, and we need that community in order to thrive. <b>The two guiding principles that have focused our planning process are protecting the health and safety of all members of our community while providing the collaborative educational experiences we treasure.</b></p>
<p>Therefore, our commitment is to make the most of our inherent strengths—as scientists and engineers—to thoughtfully and creatively modify the on-campus learning, living and working experience to preserve the quality of the education we provide while protecting the health and safety of all members of our community. It will not be easy. But if we all adhere very closely to the guidance provided by leading scientists, epidemiologists and public health resources—and <strong>if we commit as individual members of the Harvey Mudd College community</strong> <strong>to do everything we can to protect ourselves and to protect every member of our community</strong>—then I am confident we can all continue to pursue our educational mission together.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Maria</p>
<h2 class="accordian-heading">Guiding Principles</h2>
<p>Harvey Mudd College’s resources and procedures for responding to the COVID-19 pandemic are deeply rooted in the College’s educational mission while promoting the safety and well-being of our faculty, staff and students. We want to provide an environment where our faculty and students may continue engaging in learning together as safely as possible while providing the high-quality educational experience our community treasures.</p>
<p>These guidelines include not only preventative processes, but also functional means of dealing with infection, when it occurs, and of minimizing the risk of spread within our campus community. Harvey Mudd College’s plans are closely aligned with requirements by the city of Claremont, the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health, the state of California’s strategies for phased reopening of the state’s economy, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and represent a coordinated planning effort by the seven Claremont Colleges.</p>
<p>As part of this process, we are deeply committed to open and ongoing communications on the status of our efforts as well as the opportunities to adjust and improve them as the situation evolves. We realize as we continue the process of reopening our campus that we will need to be very flexible to adapt to whatever changes occur in the status of the pandemic in our area, to medical treatment and potential vaccine availability, or to regulatory efforts that will come over the next year and possibly beyond. As such, this should be considered a “living document” that will be updated as needed moving forward.</p>
<h2 class="accordian-heading">College Expectations and Guidelines</h2>
<p>It is only when our community works together to support and hold each other accountable that we can promote the health and safety of our students, faculty and staff. Therefore, we expect that everyone will fully comply with the policies, protocols and guidelines outlined in this document. Failure to do so may result in corrective action for staff and faculty or in Honor Code/Conduct Code violations for students.</p>
<p>We are all human and prone to mistakes. We encourage all members of our community to help each other follow these guidelines, which have been developed to protect our health and wellness while also ensuring we can continue to pursue our educational mission.</p>
<h3>Phased Staffing Approach</h3>
<p>Harvey Mudd College has created categories based on needs during the various stages of returning to campus so that we can support a return of faculty, staff and student employees through a coordinated process that allows for appropriate physical distancing.</p>
<p>Area vice presidents, in conjunction with leadership teams in their respective areas, will assess and coordinate expanded staffing so that we can continue to provide a robust curricular and co-curricular experience, can better manage access to required research, classroom and work environments, and access on-site resources necessary to conduct our work in support of the College’s educational mission. These decisions, once approved, will be communicated through your respective vice president.</p>
<p>We recognize that we will need to greatly reduce the number of people on campus at any given time so that we can meet physical distancing requirements. We anticipate that this need to reduce density on campus will remain throughout the fall semester and may stretch into spring 2021.</p>
<p>By adopting various stages for returning to campus, coupled with employee categories, we anticipate we will be able to more effectively coordinate access to various campus facilities so that we can mitigate potential risks and promote the safety of all members of the Harvey Mudd community. No administrative office or academic department should increase on-campus staffing levels without approval from your respective vice president. In this way, we can prepare so we are better able to adhere to guidance we anticipate being provided as part of the requirements necessary to reopen the campus for in-person instruction.</p>
<p>Once decisions to expand on-site staffing in certain areas have been made, faculty, staff and student employees should follow the guidelines detailed in this document for returning to work on campus. Questions may be directed to your respective area vice president or to the Office of Human Resources.</p>
<h3>Employee Categories (faculty, staff and student employees)</h3>
<p>For the purposes of determining which employees are needed on campus during which stages of reopening, the College has created categories based on when an employee’s physical presence will be needed on campus. It is important to note that categories may change depending on the type of work that needs to be completed during each stage mentioned above and that individual employees may fall into different categories at different stages of the Returning to Campus plan or as the situation on campus changes. Your area vice president or direct supervisor will inform you when you should report to campus in person to complete your work responsibilities.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Category 1:</strong> Your physical presence is required on campus full-time, for the time period required.</li>
<li><strong>Category 2:</strong> Your daily physical presence is not required on campus and you will be expected to complete your work assignments remotely. This will be critical to helping reduce the number of people on campus as well as the potential spread of COVID-19. The remote working arrangements should be approved by your direct supervisor and area vice president, and you will be expected to complete the College’s Telecommuting Agreement.</li>
<li><strong>Category 3:</strong> You may be asked to come to campus for a limited number of alternating days/half days during the week and/or you may be asked to stagger your arrival and departure times. This will help the College  continue to conduct critical operations while reducing the overall number of people on campus on any given day.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Stages of Returning to Campus</h3>
<p>Please note that dates below are approximate and are subject to change and may differ slightly depending on the needs of the department.</p>
<p><strong>Stage A</strong> – March 13 – May 17: Initial California Safer at Home order—only limited number of employees in Category 1 expected to report to work.</p>
<p><strong>Stage B</strong> – May 18 – August:  Preparing for possible return to campus this fall and Summer Session support. This stage includes substages for some areas of the College and is intended to comply with state orders:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>B1:</strong> Faculty and staff requiring physical resources supporting essential functions return first : 20-25 in rotation established by department chairs; strict density limitations by building and floor</li>
<li><strong>B2:</strong> Essential faculty needing solo access to labs (and perhaps postdocs): add 30-40 in rotations established by department chairs</li>
<li><strong>B3:</strong> Essential faculty needing to prepare materials for fall (numbers dependent on decisions about fall practices)</li>
<li><strong>B4:</strong> Essential staff who are telecommuting are asked to work on campus one day a week to familiarize themselves with new protocols implemented to facilitate employee safety</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Stage C</strong> – Ramp up to beginning the fall semester</p>
<p><strong>Stage D</strong> – Start of the fall semester (August 24)</p>
<h2 class="accordian-heading">Health and Safety Guidelines</h2>
<p>All faculty, staff and student employees have a responsibility to protect themselves as well as other members of the Harvey Mudd College community. <strong>If you are experiencing symptoms of COVID-19 or if you have been in contact with a person with a confirmed or suspected diagnosis of COVID-19 in the past 14 days, it is critical that you do not come to work on campus</strong> and that you contact your immediate supervisor as soon as possible to inform them.</p>
<h3>Symptom Monitoring</h3>
<p>Students, faculty and staff in categories 1 and 3 (see Employee Categories above) should <a href="https://bit.ly/saferatmudd">conduct symptom monitoring</a> each day before reporting to work. You must be free of any symptoms potentially related to COVID-19 to report to work on campus and you must not have been in close contact (e.g. within 6 feet) and without a mask, with a person with a confirmed Diagnosis of COVID-19 in the past 14 days. As a reminder, the College plans to continue allowing staff to go into negative accrual for sick leave. The College typically does not allow exceptions for staff to use more than accrued time earned. Due to the unprecedented times, the President’s Cabinet temporarily approved allowing staff members to use whatever sick time was needed, whether it had been earned or not, including allowing a negative accrual balance. As time progresses, accrued time balances will be restored. The College is allowing this temporary change in our practice until further notice. Please notify your supervisor, in advance of your shift, that you will be staying home and to determine the appropriate course of action.</p>
<p>At this time, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines define COVID-19 symptoms as including one or more of the following (Visit: <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/symptoms-testing/symptoms.html">Symptoms of Coronavirus</a>):</p>
<ul>
<li>Fever or chills</li>
<li>Cough</li>
<li>Shortness of breath or difficulty breathing</li>
<li>Fatigue</li>
<li>Muscle or body aches</li>
<li>Headache</li>
<li>New loss of taste or smell</li>
<li>Sore throat</li>
<li>Congestion or runny nose</li>
<li>Nausea or vomiting</li>
</ul>
<p>People with COVID-19 have had a wide range of symptoms reported—ranging from mild symptoms to severe illness. Symptoms may appear <strong>2-14 days after exposure</strong> <strong>to the virus.</strong></p>
<h3>When to Seek Emergency Medical Attention</h3>
<p>Look for <strong>emergency warning signs*</strong> for COVID-19. If you or someone you know is showing any of these signs, <strong>seek emergency medical care</strong> <strong>immediately:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Trouble breathing</li>
<li>Persistent pain or pressure in the chest</li>
<li>New confusion</li>
<li>Inability to wake or stay awake</li>
<li>Bluish lips or face</li>
</ul>
<p>*This list is not all possible symptoms. Please contact your medical provider for any other symptoms that are severe or concerning to you.</p>
<p><strong>Call 911 or call ahead to your local emergency facility: </strong>Notify the operator that you are seeking care for yourself or someone else who has or may have COVID-19.</p>
<h3>High Risk Employees</h3>
<p>COVID-19 is a new disease and there is limited information regarding risk factors for severe disease. Based on currently available information and clinical expertise, <strong>older adults and people of any age who have serious underlying medical conditions</strong> might be at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19.</p>
<p>Based on guidance from the CDC, those at high-risk for severe illness from COVID-19 are:</p>
<ul>
<li>People 65 years and older</li>
<li>People who live in a nursing home or long-term care facility</li>
</ul>
<p>People of all ages with underlying medical conditions, particularly if not well controlled, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>People with chronic lung disease or moderate to severe asthma</li>
<li>People who have serious heart conditions</li>
<li>People who are immunocompromised
<ul>
<li>Many conditions can cause a person to be immunocompromised, including cancer treatment, smoking, bone marrow or organ transplantation, immune deficiencies, poorly controlled HIV or AIDS, and prolonged use of corticosteroids and other immune weakening medications</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>People with severe obesity (body mass index [BMI] of 40 or higher)</li>
<li>People with diabetes</li>
<li>People with chronic kidney disease undergoing dialysis</li>
<li>People with liver disease</li>
</ul>
<p>Faculty, staff and student employees who are pregnant or who have been instructed to return to work on campus and have a medical condition that places them in a higher risk group should contact your direct supervisor or the Office of Human Resources to discuss your options, including requesting ADA Reasonable Accommodations.</p>
<h3>Personal Safety Practices</h3>
<h4>Face Masks/Cloth Face Coverings</h4>
<p>Face masks or face coverings must be worn by all employees at all times when working in the presence of others and in settings when social distancing is difficult or impossible to enforce (i.e., common workspaces such as labs, classrooms, meeting rooms, etc.). The appropriate use of face masks/coverings is a critical measure in possibly preventing the spread of COVID-19. Your mask minimizes the risk to others who may be at higher risk or more susceptible to the novel coronavirus since it is possible for you to spread COVID-19 even if you do not feel sick. Please keep in mind that the mask or cloth face covering is not intended to be a substitute for social distancing measures.</p>
<p>Harvey Mudd College has a supply of disposable masks and other personal protective equipment necessary for the safety of employees. In addition, the College has ordered and will provide at least one reusable cloth face mask to all students, faculty and staff to supplement what you may have already. Please keep in mind that reusable, cloth face coverings may be worn only one time and then must be cleaned before being used again in order to remain safe. Having a week’s supply of reusable cloth face coverings can help reduce the need for daily laundering as well as wear and tear on your face masks. If you need assistance obtaining appropriate face coverings, we encourage you to contact Theresa Lauer, senior director for facilities, emergency preparedness and safety, or the Office of Human Resources.</p>
<h4>Use and Care of Face Coverings</h4>
<h5>Putting on the face covering/disposable mask safely</h5>
<ul>
<li>Wash your hands thoroughly using the guidelines provided in the hand hygiene section of this document or use hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol content prior to handling the clean face covering/disposable mask.</li>
<li>Ensure that the face covering/disposable mask fits properly over your nose and under your chin. The fit should be as snug as possible.</li>
<li>Situate the face covering/disposable mask properly with nose wire snug against the nose (if applicable; not all masks have adjustable nose clips/wires).</li>
<li>Tie straps behind the head or loop around the ears.</li>
<li>Throughout the process, and as long as you are wearing the face covering/disposable mask, it is important that you avoid touching the front of the mask/face covering.</li>
</ul>
<h5>Removing the face covering/disposable mask safely</h5>
<ul>
<li>Do not touch your eyes, nose or mouth when removing your face covering/disposable mask.</li>
<li>When taking off your face covering/disposable mask, loop your finger into the strap and pull it away from your ear, or untie the straps (as appropriate).</li>
<li>Wash your hands immediately after removing, following the instructions in the hand hygiene section below.</li>
</ul>
<h5>Care, storage and laundering your mask</h5>
<ul>
<li>Cloth face coverings may not be used more than one day at a time and must be washed after every use. Cloth face coverings should be properly laundered with regular clothing detergent before their first use and after each day of use. Cloth face coverings should be replaced immediately if soiled or damaged (e.g., ripped, punctured).</li>
<li>Disposable masks must not be used for more than one day and should be placed in the trash at the end of the day or if it becomes soiled or damaged (e.g., stretched ear loops, ripped, punctured).</li>
</ul>
<h4>Physical (Social) Distancing</h4>
<p>Physical distancing, also called “social distancing,” means keeping space between you and other people who live outside of your home. To practice physical distancing:</p>
<ul>
<li>Stay at least 6 feet (about two arms’ length) away from other people at all times</li>
<li>Do not gather in groups</li>
<li>Stay out of crowded places and avoid mass gatherings of people</li>
</ul>
<p>Keeping space between you and others is one of the best tools we have to avoid being exposed to the novel coronavirus and slowing its spread locally and across the country. It is important that you limit close contact with others outside your household in indoor and outdoor spaces. Since people can spread the COVID-19 virus before they realize they are sick, and since it is impossible to know who may be in a higher risk group for complications from the virus, it is critical to keep your distance from other people when possible.</p>

<h4>Hand Hygiene</h4>
<p>According to CDC guidelines, it is important that you wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after you have been in a public place or after blowing your nose, coughing, sneezing or touching your face. If soap and water are not readily available, you can use a hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol (check the back of the label for alcohol content—all college-provided hand sanitizer available in stations across the campus are in compliance with CDC recommendations). Apply enough so that you can cover all surfaces of your hands and rub them together until they feel dry. Avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth, and wash your hands after touching your face.</p>
<h4>Gloves and Other Personal Protective Equipment</h4>
<p>Employees in dining services and those carrying out specific cleaning roles as well as faculty and students in certain laboratory situations should use gloves as part of PPE (personal protective equipment). According to the CDC, gloves are not necessary for general use and do not replace good hand hygiene. Washing your hands often is considered best practice for common everyday tasks. Faculty, staff or student employees who have questions about whether PPE is necessary, or about how to appropriately use PPE, should contact Theresa Lauer, senior director for facilities, emergency preparedness and safety.</p>
<h4>Personal Disinfection</h4>
<p>While facilities and maintenance staff will continue to clean offices, classrooms, labs and workspaces based on CDC guidelines, additional care should be taken by all members of our community when interacting with commonly used surfaces in public areas. Common areas and frequently touched objects, such as tables, doorknobs, light switches, countertops, handles, desks, phones, keyboards, elevator switches and buttons, touch screens, printers/copiers, grab bars and handrails, will be cleaned/disinfected daily using EPA-approved disinfectants and following the manufacturer’s instructions for use.</p>
<p>The College has made available disinfecting cleaning supply stations in each academic and administrative building for your convenience. We encourage you to wipe down surfaces in workspaces that might be used by someone else, including things like copiers, shared kitchen surfaces, etc. In this way, each faculty, staff or student employee can help our facilities and maintenance team by disinfecting surfaces that F&amp;M may not realize have been used during your time on campus.</p>
<h4>Coughing/Sneezing Hygiene</h4>
<p>If you are in a private setting and do not have your cloth face covering/disposable mask, remember to cover your mouth and nose with a tissue when you cough or sneeze or use the inside of your elbow. After using, throw the used tissues in the trash. Immediately wash your hands with soap and water for 20 seconds. If soap and water are not readily available, clean your hands with hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol. It is important that employees only use their own offices/workspace.</p>
<h3>What to Do If You Are Exposed to COVID-19</h3>
<p>Faculty, staff and student employees who test positive for COVID-19 must self-isolate at home or in their residence hall room until they have recovered and should contact their supervisor who will coordinate with Human Resources. For those who test positive, their physician or Student Health Services will need to clear them before returning to work. To help determine the risk of potential exposure to co-workers and others on campus, the Office of Human Resources, Division of Student Affairs, Student Health Services or Los Angeles County Public Health officials will conduct a phone interview with the individual who has tested positive. Employees  will be made aware that they may have been exposed so that their risk can be assessed. Human Resources or potentially other health officials may contact the supervisor if further contact tracing of the COVID-19 positive individual is needed; however, the actual test result (and any other protected health information) will not be disclosed.</p>
<p>The College recommends that you review guidance recommended by Los Angeles County Public Health. This <a href="http://publichealth.lacounty.gov/media/Coronavirus/">guidance is available online</a> in English, Spanish and a number of other languages.</p>

<h3>Guidelines for Specific Workplace Scenarios</h3>
<h4>Business and Personal Travel</h4>
<p>Generally, the College will not permit College-sponsored, business-related travel, either domestically or internationally.  Exceptions for faculty research travel during the summer intersession and sabbaticals may be made by the vice president for academic affairs in consultation with the president.</p>
<p>If you voluntarily travel away from your local community (i.e., visiting a tourist destination such as a beach, amusement park, etc.) know that these activities increase your chances of getting infected and spreading COVID-19. If you get sick with COVID-19 or come in contact with someone who is infected, you will need to stay at home until you are no longer considered infectious. Please contact your supervisor and the Office of Human Resources for additional guidance.</p>
<p>We strongly encourage you to review <a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel">the latest travel-related notices from the CDC</a> and <a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/traveladvisories/traveladvisories.html/">U.S. Department of State</a> to make sure you will be able to get into and out of the areas you plan to visit. We ask that you keep in mind that any international travel carries a risk that you might be quarantined or prevented from returning to the U.S. If possible, the safest option is to postpone your trip. If that is not possible, we encourage you to explore travel-related insurance options to help you obtain medical treatment and/or be evacuated in the event of an emergency.</p>
<h4>Public Transportation</h4>
<p>If you take public transportation to campus, please wear a mask before entering the bus/train and avoid touching surfaces with your hands as much as possible. Upon disembarking the bus or train, wash your hands thoroughly for 20 seconds or use a hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol as soon as possible and<strong><i> before</i></strong> removing your face mask.</p>
<h4>Carpool/Rideshare</h4>
<p>If at all possible, the College suggests employees temporarily suspend carpooling and rideshare with non-family members for the time being. If you are unable to do so, we encourage you to please wear a face mask prior to entering the vehicle and to sit as far apart in the vehicle as practical. Upon exiting the vehicle, you should wash your hands thoroughly for 20 seconds or use a hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol as soon as possible <strong><i>before</i></strong> removing your face mask.</p>
<h4>Working on Campus</h4>
<p>Harvey Mudd College is working to significantly reduce the density of employees on campus by allowing those who are able to telecommute to continue doing so and/or to stagger the days of work and arrival/departure times for other employees. Your area vice president and/or direct supervisor will provide guidance when and if you should report to campus to complete your work. Until you are told to do so, no employee should be on campus without first getting approval from their area vice president.</p>
<p>In addition, signage will be posted to inform faculty, students and staff about the maximum occupancy limitations on campus spaces so that we can reduce density in these spaces. In some cases, stairways may be limited to single directions (either up only, or down only), campus walkways and pathways will be limited to single directions (either north, east, west or south only) and elevators will be limited to no more than one occupant at a time (unless additional occupancy is specified on posted signs). We encourage you to pay close attention to posted signage and to follow the instructions carefully to protect all members of our community.</p>
<h5>Work in an Office Environment</h5>
<p>If you work in an open office environment (i.e., shared space with dividers such as cubicle walls), be sure to maintain at least 6 feet of distance from your fellow employees whenever possible. Also, you should wear a face mask or face covering at all times while in a shared work space/room.</p>
<p>If you work in an individual office, no more than one person should be in the same room unless the required 6 feet of distancing can be consistently maintained. If more than one person is in a room, masks/face coverings should be worn at all times. If you are the only person in your office with the door closed, you may remove your face covering using the instructions provided in this document for safely doing so. However, please post a notice outside your door that you are occupying your office so that another employee does not accidentally enter your space (to clean it, for example) while you are not wearing your face mask.</p>
<p>Masks/face coverings should be worn by any staff in a reception/receiving area. Masks/face coverings should be used when inside any Harvey Mudd College facility where others are</p>
<p>present, including walking in narrow hallways where others travel and in break rooms, conference rooms and other meeting locations. Again, it is critical that all faculty, staff and student employees follow posted directional signage and follow any guidance posted on limitations to occupancy of rooms on campus.</p>
<h5>Using Restrooms</h5>
<p>Use of restrooms should be limited based on the size to ensure at least 6 feet of distance between people. Wash your hands thoroughly afterward to reduce the potential transmission of the virus.</p>
<h5>Using Elevators</h5>
<p>Use of elevators will be limited to one person in one elevator at a time (unless additional occupancy is specified on posted signs). If you are using the elevator, wear your mask or face covering at all times. After exiting the elevator, wash your hands thoroughly or use hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol solution.</p>
<h5>Meetings</h5>
<p>We strongly discourage convening in-person as it greatly increases the risk of viral transmission. No in-person meetings are allowed (classroom instruction with appropriate physical distancing is permitted). Office hours, advising and tutoring should be conducted online. Where feasible, all meetings should be held in whole or in part using video conferencing or online collaboration tools (e.g., Zoom, Microsoft Teams, Google Meet, phone, online chat, etc.). Where exceptions are necessary, the meetings should be conducted outdoors with face coverings and using appropriate social/physical distancing.</p>
<p>During your work time on campus, you are encouraged to communicate with your colleagues and supervisors as needed via email, instant message, telephone or other available technology rather than face-to-face communication. You also can use tools the College provides, such as Google Meet  or Microsoft Teams. You can set up a Google Chat or Microsoft Team for your team members to use to communicate, or use any of a number of other tools. <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/13QjhKbCiVq084Rqz9kO86iaKTYdeZAdCuJHvZLFwssU/edit?usp=sharing">CIS has provided a number of helpful resources</a> to consider on the College’s Coronavirus Information site.</p>
<h5>Greeting Colleagues and Friends</h5>
<p>We encourage faculty, staff and student employees to avoid shaking hands—both on-campus and off-campus—and to find alternative ways to say “hello” when greeting their friends and colleagues. It is important to remember to wear a face mask at all times and to maintain at least 6 feet of physical/social distance at all times.</p>
<h5>Meals</h5>
<p>Before and after eating, you should wash your hands thoroughly to reduce the potential transmission of the virus or use a hand sanitizer with a minimum of 60% alcohol. Hand sanitizing stations are available at all Harvey Mudd College dining facilities. Harvey Mudd College will extend the hours of operation as needed to provide greater opportunities for faculty, students and staff to get meals on campus while reducing the density of people in dining facilities at one time.</p>
<p>If dining on campus, you should wear your mask or face covering until you are ready to eat and then replace it afterward. All dining facilities have been altered to meet requirements allowing at least 6 feet of distance between each diner, including lines and seating arrangements, and partitions added. Please follow all posted instructions when entering dining facilities. Jay’s Place will be open during the evenings and available for to-go orders. No seating will be available. The College is adding tables outside to provide additional dining options in open-air locations. Faculty and staff, who are able, are encouraged to take food back to your office area or eat outside, depending on your situation.</p>
<p>If you are eating in your work environment (break room, office, etc.), maintain 6 feet distance between you and others. You should not sit facing one another. Only remove your mask or face covering in order to eat, then put it back on. Wipe all surfaces, including table, refrigerator handle, coffee machine, etc. after using in common areas.</p>
<h5>Laboratory Work</h5>
<p>A working group composed of Dean of Faculty Lisa Sullivan, the Department Chairs Committee, Registrar Mark Ashley and Senior Director of Facilities, Emergency Preparedness and Safety Theresa Lauer have developed specific guidelines for faculty, staff and students working in laboratory and Clinic environments. See the <a href="https://www.hmc.edu/coronavirus-information/">College’s website</a> for additional information and instructions.</p>
<h3>Mental and Emotional Well-being</h3>
<h4>Faculty and Staff</h4>
<p>Harvey Mudd College participates in the Optum Employee Assistance Program to provide mental and emotional well-being resources to faculty and staff. Information on the program, including how to access the benefit, is available on the <a href="https://www.hmc.edu/human-resources/benefits/">Benefits page</a> of the Human Resources website. If you have questions about how to access this benefit, please contact the Office of Human Resources.</p>
<h4>Student Employees</h4>
<p>Student employees needing assistance are encouraged to contact Monsour Counseling and Psychological Services at 909.621.8202. For after-hours emergencies, call the number and dial “1” when prompted to be connected with an on-call therapist.</p>
<h3>Enter/Exit Control</h3>
<p>All faculty, staff and student employees have a responsibility to protect themselves as well as other members of the Harvey Mudd College community. <strong>If you are experiencing symptoms of COVID-19 or if you have been in contact with a person with a confirmed or suspected diagnosis of COVID-19 in the past 14 days, it is critical that you do not come to work on campus</strong> and that you contact your immediate supervisor as soon as possible to inform them.</p>
<h4>Questionnaire</h4>
<p>Harvey Mudd College has developed a <a href="https://bit.ly/staysafeatmudd">Stay Safe At Mudd Symptom Screening questionnaire</a> that all faculty, staff and student employees must successfully complete. Please complete this questionnaire each day you are expected to attend work on campus to certify that you have no symptoms. Your responses will be completely confidential. The questionnaire will ask you about any symptoms you might be experiencing and will confirm your clearance to work on campus.</p>
<ul>
<li>If you complete the questionnaire and receive instructions that you are cleared to work, please do so.</li>
<li>If you are not symptom-free, you will be provided with additional instructions you must follow before you are allowed to return to work.</li>
</ul>
<p>Our goals are to promote the health and safety of all members of our community and to provide the best educational experience possible for our faculty and students during these unprecedented circumstances. To meet these goals, <strong><i>every member of our community</i></strong> must take personal responsibility for not only protecting themselves, but also for helping to protect the most vulnerable among us. The College will work with staff to ensure they are able to take paid sick leave, regardless of their sick leave balances, and we will work with faculty and students to identify alternative arrangements.</p>
<h4>Building Entry</h4>
<p>Once you are <a href="https://bit.ly/staysafeatmudd">cleared by the questionnaire</a> to work on campus, if you have a smartphone and are willing to install the HMC Campus App (available on <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.oohlala.hmc&amp;hl=en_US">Google Play</a> or <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/harvey-mudd-college/id1271479884">Apple Store</a>), you can use it to help us keep track of building occupancy numbers by checking in using the QR codes at the entrances to buildings.</p>
<p>The purpose of scanning in and out of buildings is to aid in monitoring occupancy numbers and to assist in contact tracing should it become necessary. The information captured in the app will only be used in the event it becomes necessary and will not be retained any longer than necessary.</p>
<p>Entry to buildings will be regulated and monitored. Your Harvey Mudd College identification is required for entry to all buildings, and you may not hold or prop open exterior doors for any other person. You may be instructed to use certain entry and/or departure doors to alleviate traffic congestion entering and leaving certain buildings. You will receive instructions from your supervisor or area vice president on the appropriate procedures.</p>
<p>Visitors, guests and pets are not allowed on worksites during this time without prior express permission from your area vice president. Violation of these guidelines may result in the immediate revocation of building access privileges as well as corrective action.</p>
<p>Approved vendors will be allowed on campus, however, they must check in advance with the staff/faculty they are meeting with and information needs to be accumulated by such faculty/staff in a central location in order to maintain appropriate contact tracing records. If a vendor is approved to be on campus, the area vice president and department leader is responsible for ensuring they are following HMC’s protocols for safety. Vendors must complete the <a href="https://hmc.formstack.com/forms/keeping_mudd_safe_nothmc">HMC questionnaire</a> to attest that they believe themselves free of COVID-19 symptoms and must wear a face mask while on campus. As much as possible, vendors should adhere to Harvey Mudd’s physical/social distancing requirements (remain 6 feet away from others).</p>
<h4>What to Carry with You At All Times</h4>
<p>As part of its plan to reduce density on campus as well as to assist with potential contact tracing activities, the College is requesting employees to notate or identify when they enter or exit any building. This can be accomplished using a variety of tools (HMC Stay Safe at Mudd App using QR codes, ID card scanned both when entering and exiting a building or other tool HMC identifies and makes available to employees). Additionally, the College requests that you keep the following with you at all times:</p>
<ol>
<li>Your college identification: Will be needed to swipe in and out of buildings on campus.</li>
<li>If you have a smartphone and are willing to install the HMC Campus App (available on <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.oohlala.hmc&amp;hl=en_US">Google Play</a> or <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/harvey-mudd-college/id1271479884">Apple Store</a>) you can use it to help us keep track of building occupancy numbers by checking in using the QR codes at the entrances to buildings. The HMC Campus App also has other useful links.</li>
<li>Your office/lab keys.</li>
<li>Your face mask or disposable face covering: Please wear it at all times except as specified elsewhere in this document.</li>
<li>Personal hand sanitizer: The College will provide one bottle for each faculty, staff or student member of our community.</li>
</ol>
