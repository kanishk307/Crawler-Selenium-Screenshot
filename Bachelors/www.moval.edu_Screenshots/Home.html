<p>Missouri Valley College has received a limited Grant from the Department of Education titled the Higher Education Relief Fund under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, Economic Security (CARES) Act. The Grant includes Emergency Financial Aid Grants to Students. In connection with the Grants to Students, MVC signed and returned to the Department of Education the Certification and Agreement which, in part,  acknowledges that MVC intends to use no less than 50% of the funds received under Section 18004(a)(1) of the CARES Act to provide Emergency Financial Aid Grants to students.</p>
<ul>
<li>$661,459 –    Total amount received in connection with the DOE pursuant to MVC’s Certification and Agreement for Emergency Financial Aid to Students.</li>
<li>$633,201 –    Total amount Emergency Financial Grants distributed to students under Section 18004(a)(1) of the CARES Act as of May 21, 2020.</li>
<li>906 &#8211;     Estimated total number of students at MVC eligible to receive Emergency Financial Aid Grants to Students under Section 18004(a)(1) of the CARES Act as of May 21, 2020.</li>
<li>906 &#8211;    Total number of students who have received Emergency Financial Aid Grants to Students under Section 18994(a)(1) of the CARES Act as of May 21, 2020.</li>
</ul>
<p>Specific instructions, directions, and guidance to students are provided in this report. An announcement to students via email and social media was also disseminated to all students on May 8, 2020.</p>
<p><b>Fund Description:</b></p>
<p>The Missouri Valley College COVID-19 Student Relief Fund is designed to assist currently enrolled students with expenses caused by the interruption of operations on campus due to the COVID-19 pandemic. This Student Relief Fund comes from limited federal stimulus funds (CARES Act) and is restricted by the Department of Education to eligible US students. In order to qualify for an award, the student must have been enrolled in face to face classes at MVC as of March 13, 2020.</p>
<p>Our goal in distributing this Fund is to adhere to the specific guidelines set forth by the US Department of Education: 1) assisting those students most in need while spreading the limited grant funds as widely as possible, and 2) getting the funds directly in the hands of our students as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Fund proceeds were allocated to students based on a number of factors, including, most importantly, the Expected Family Contribution (EFC) on the FAFSA of the student, and student classification (Resident Full Time, Commuter Full Time, Resident Part Time, or Commuter Part Time). The maximum student award was $1,100. Table 1 below shows individual award categories by EFC and student classification.</p>
<p>No application is required to receive the student award. Mail distribution of the student awards began Friday, May 8 to each student’s most recent student address on file at MVC.</p>
<p>If you are a US student who was enrolled in face to face classes at MVC on March 13, 2020, you will be receiving a check in the coming days. If you have not received a check by May 18, please call the MVC Business Office at (660) 831-4105.</p>

<p><b>Part-Time Students</b>:</p>
<p>For students attending MVC on a less-than full time basis (less than 12 hours for undergraduate students or less than 9 hours for graduate students), the relief amount was determined using the following formula:</p>
<p>Part-time example for <i>an undergraduate commuter in 6 hours with a 0 EFC</i>:</p>
<ol>
<li>  6 Hours / 12 Hours (minimum for full time status) = 0.5</li>
<li>  0.5 * $770 (770 is the 0 EFC allocation for a commuter [Table 1])</li>
<li>3.    Relief Amount = $385.00</li>

<div class="gmail_default">
<div class="gmail_default">MVC now expects to begin distribution of room and board refunds beginning Wednesday, May 20 to MVC students who moved out of housing on or after March 16, which is the day that MVC announced the transition from face-to-face classes to all online classes for the remainder of the FY20 Spring Semester. Students will be credited on a prorated basis for housing and dining room fees that they have paid based on the number of days after March 16 that they were no longer at MVC. No refunds will be issued for students who moved out of housing on or after May 1, 2020.</div>
<div class="gmail_default">
<p dir="ltr">Each affected student will receive an email in the next few days showing their specific refund amount and the manner in which it was calculated. Refunds remaining after deduction for any existing student account receivable will be mailed out to each student’s most recent address on file at MVC or, at the election of the student, to their Paypal account.</p>

<div class="content">
<div class="wpb_text_column wpb_content_element " >
<div class="wpb_wrapper">
<div class="gmail_default">
<p dir="ltr">The welfare and safety of our campus community during this time is our primary concern. A positive Covid-19 case has been reported on the Missouri Valley College campus. An employee of the College’s food service provider tested positive, and that individual as well as all dining hall staff members who came into contact with the employee, have been instructed to quarantine at home. This is the first positive case reported on the MVC campus.</p>
<p dir="ltr">After the College was notified of the positive case, the MVC dining hall was closed immediately in order to properly sanitize the food service areas. Due to this closure, MVC students were unable to receive a meal from the dining hall on the evening of 5/5/20. MVC students will be reimbursed for food expenses incurred on the evening of 5/5/20 (up to a certain amount). Students can contact the business office to arrange for reimbursement. Additional dining hall staff members have been deployed to campus to assist in continuing to serve students remaining on campus. In accordance with the academic calendar, the dining hall will close for summer after lunch on 5/8/20.</p>
<p dir="ltr">We understand that this is a challenging situation. We ask that you respect the privacy of this individual. Missouri Valley College will continue to monitor the situation and work closely with local health officials. We will provide updates as they are available.</p>

<div class="title">5/5/20 Update: MVC Prepares for Face-to-Face Classes to Resume this Fall</div>
<div class="content">
<div class="wpb_text_column wpb_content_element " >
<div class="wpb_wrapper">
<div class="gmail_default">
<p dir="ltr">Missouri Valley College President Bonnie Humphrey says the College administration is preparing for face-to-face classes to resume this fall.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, all MVC classes transitioned online March 16 for the remainder of the spring semester.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“We were able to smoothly transition to online classes in March, and while we are continuing classes online through the spring semester and the summer, we expect to resume face-to-face classes this fall,” Humphrey said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Missouri Valley College is already making plans to provide a quality educational experience in accordance with any new and evolving health guidelines. New measures are being added to campus this fall including additional healthcare staff in the Student Health Center and developing social distancing practices specific to the MVC campus.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“I miss our students being on campus, and we cannot wait to welcome them back this fall with their health and safety as our top priority,” Humphrey said. “ With the situation changing daily, MVC will continue to provide updates as we move closer to the fall 2020 semester.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">In addition to academics and other extracurricular activities that will have to adapt to any new health guidelines, the National Intercollegiate Association of Athletics (NAIA) plans to have a fall sports season that may look a little different in order to keep student-athletes safe.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Our current plan is to conduct a fall sport season, culminating in fall championships. But given the uncertainty that will be with us for some time, our plan must be flexible and fiscally responsible, while prioritizing the health and safety of our students. We will continue to work closely with the Council of Presidents and National Administrative Council to explore options and make decisions at the appropriate times,” said NAIA President and CEO Jim Carr in an April 23 update.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Missouri Valley College will continually work with local health officials and the NAIA to develop precautionary measures to keep student-athletes healthy and safe during the fall sport season.</p>
<p dir="ltr">To date, there have been no reported positive Covid-19 cases on the MVC campus.

<p dir="ltr">Based on recommendations from the Saline County Health Department, Missouri Valley College has asked seven students to self-quarantine for 14 days in a precautionary manner related to the Covid-19 virus.  Three of the seven students are being quarantined in campus housing. The remaining four are quarantined off campus at their individual residences. Currently, none of the seven individuals have tested positive for the Covid-19 virus.</p>
<p dir="ltr">As a reminder, please remember to use proper hand hygiene and practice social distancing. If you develop symptoms of Covid-19, contact student health services or your healthcare provider for further instruction and testing information.</p>

<p dir="ltr">During the last few weeks, the Cabinet members and I have been putting plans in place that would comply with a state mandated stay-at-home order. The core of our decision making has always been two-fold: 1) maintain a good work environment that keeps the employees and students safe and healthy and 2) keep Missouri Valley College fiscally and academically sound as we continue preparations for a successful fall 2020 semester.</p>
<p dir="ltr">In response to the stay-at-home order issued by Missouri Governor Mike Parson Friday, beginning on Monday (4/6), we will put our plan into action.  It is imperative that we work diligently and urgently to continue to prepare for a great fall semester. Housekeeping and maintenance will continue their normal duties. Housekeeping cleans and disinfects the residence halls in the morning and the academic buildings in the afternoon.  They wear appropriate protective gear and use disinfectants specifically made for the Covid-19 virus. Maintenance is working on some preplanned summer projects and are on hand to take care of anything that might need attention in the residence halls.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Student Affairs will be there for the students with campus security on duty, as well as a skeleton staff of hall directors and resident assistants. The mental health counselors and student success personnel will be working remotely. The campus nurse will continue to be on campus and available by appointment only.   The library will move to limited hours, 10 a.m. &#8211; 2 p.m. All other campus offices will begin working remotely as much as possible with the supervisor’s approval. Some faculty will continue to teach their classes remotely, but from their campus office.</p>
<p dir="ltr">I ask everyone for flexibility and patience during this unprecedented time because none of us really know what the future holds in this situation. However, I am confident that, together, we will get through this while continuing to move Missouri Valley College forward.</p>
<p dir="ltr">If you have any questions about working remotely, please contact your supervisor.</p>

<p>We take great pride in maintaining a healthy and safe campus, and we know that this is more important right now than ever with the coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic. One of the institutional goals of Missouri Valley College is to “maintain a safe, healthy campus environment conducive to learning and research based on academic freedom, innovative teaching, and intellectual inquiry.” <strong>I want you to know that the health and safety of our entire campus community is our first priority.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>In addition to our normal cleaning procedures, we have instituted additional rotations throughout our campus to clean multiple times per day using the cleaning supplies recommended by our supplier to specifically target Covid 19.

<p><b>MVC Covid-19 EMERGENCY RESPONSE PLAN</b></p>
<p><b>Overview</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This plan has been developed with input from the Crisis Response Team President’s Cabinet, Saline County Health Dept. (SCHD), and Fitzgibbon Hospital.  This document is to be a guide for Missouri Valley College’s response to the Covid-19. This document and the policies within it may be adjusted if new information is given by the Federal Government or Center for Disease Control.</span></p>
<p><b>Goals</b></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Provide accurate information to all College constituents.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Provide excellent health care to our students.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Provide a safe environment for all constituents of the college.  </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Provide a safe and healthy environment in which our students can recover.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><b>Operating principles</b></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Open and continuous communication with faculty, staff, students, parents, and other important constituents.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Emphasis on coughing etiquette and hand sanitation; wash your hands often.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Clear instructions that students who exhibit Flu like symptoms must immediately schedule an appointment with the Student Health Center and that faculty and staff who exhibit flu-like symptoms must seek treatment from their local physician and remain home until cleared to return.</span></li>
</ul>
<h2><b>Pre-Event</b></h2>
<p><b>Communications Campaign</b></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">E-mail college community directing them to CDC.gov for up-to-date info as well as to the College’s web page containing this plan.  </span></li>
</ul>
<p><b>Meetings</b></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Faculty encouraged to talk about absence policy and the ability to make up work for students who are potentially at risk of having Covid-19. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meeting with Food Service and housekeeping personnel to discuss possibilities of infectious workplace and contingency to provide the campus with general services.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><b>Covid-19 Vaccination  </b></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Currently there is no vaccination or medication that fights against the Covid-19 Virus.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CDC Recommends that the individuals who obtain the virus treat the symptoms and stay hydrated. </span></li>
</ul>
<p><b>Additional Information</b></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Testing for Covid-19 will likely occur while supplies last.  As the virus spreads most likely testing will cease and we will be responding to the symptoms.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The CDC recommendation for a school closing or recess will be followed.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seasonal flu and H1N1 vaccinations will be held in the fall as soon as vaccines become available </span></li>
</ul>
<h2><b>Event</b></h2>
<p><b>The Symptoms</b></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fever (usually high)</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cough</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Runny or stuffy nose</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shortness of Breath</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">T</span><b>he Trigger Event  </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is no specific incident or number of cases that would act as the trigger for a College response. The response to an outbreak of the Covid-19 is likely to be based on a variety of different events that occur within a specific time. The college will operate under its best judgement and at the advice and order of the Federal Government, Center for Disease Control, and the Saline County Health Department</span></p>
<p><b>Operating Principles</b></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The college will emphasize that the patient is contagious up to 14 days before symptoms manifest themselves, in which case roommates will have already been exposed to the virus.  We recommend that roommates not relocate to another room after their roommate begins to exhibit Covid-19 symptoms. Since they have already been exposed, roommates may be carriers and may infect the “healthy location” if they relocate there.   </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Parents may decide to take their child home if they become ill.  We ask that they inform us of this decision. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Respiratory isolation</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">is the recommended action by CDC and the college meaning that those who are sick should isolate themselves from others by staying home and not attending classes, work, social events, and any other activities that put them in contact with other people.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><b>Crisis Response Team Options</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If the Crisis Response Team is called into action, a series of action plans may be activated as deemed appropriate and necessary:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Large gatherings, including athletic events, may be postponed or canceled.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The nurse’s office may expand its hours of operation.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dining service protocols may be changed or altered.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Faculty and staff who exhibit Covid-19 like systems should stay home and not return to work until cleared by a doctor. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">All faculty and staff experiencing Covid-19 like symptoms and staying at home should contact their cabinet level supervisor.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Faculty and staff who have immediate family members exhibiting Covid-19 like symptoms may be required to stay at home.  If so please inform your cabinet level supervisor of this decision. Any staff member who has the possibility of contracting the Covid-19 will need to seek medical assistance and quarantine themselves until cleared.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">E-mails and web postings will begin and continue throughout the outbreak to update the community on the current situation, updated action plans, and instructions.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">All students with Covid-19 like symptoms will be referred to the Nurse’s Office.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Students will be assessed by the nursing staff.  If they are exhibiting Covid-19 like symptoms, the following may occur:</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">They will asked a series of questions related to those having the probability of obtaining Covid-19.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If they fall into the category of potentially infected they will be placed into an isolated room and the Saline County Health Department (SCHD) will be notified.  The SCHD will then instruct/take control of that patients monitoring. They are not to attend class, work, practices, or other activities until released by the SCHD/Doctor care.</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chaplain’s office may be requested to contact parents as well.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Assistant to the Vice President of Academic Affairs will compile a listing of students with illness and send to faculty at the end of each day.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sick students will be required to stay in isolation until instructed by health officials charged with their care/isolation.  </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Crisis Response Plan may order that a temporary Grab-n-Go be set up by Dining Services.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">These protocols may be amended/changed based on recommendations from the CDC, the Federal Government, Saline County Health Department/our own particular situation.   </span></li>
</ul>
<h2><b>Post Event</b></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Crisis Response Team will communicate to the community about protocols and services enacted during the outbreak that will be discontinued.  A timeline for the phasing out of these services will be communicated as well.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Crisis Response Team will consult with the Saline Count Health Department and the CDC for additional recommendations.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Crisis Response Team will complete a debriefing and an after action report.</span></li>

<h2>Novel Coronavirus (Covid-19)</h2>
<p>Missouri Valley College with help from the Saline County Health Department and the Missouri Department of Health is continuing to monitor the outbreak of the coronavirus. The virus was first discovered in December 2019 in Wuhan China. Currently the virus has spread to all continents excluding Antarctica.</p>
<p>The Covid-19 causes mild to severe respiratory illness which can develop more serious complications such as pneumonia. Complications from the coronavirus, according to the Center for Disease Control (CDC), usually arise from individuals with compromised immune systems or other health related issues such as COPD, diabetes, etc.</p>
<p>The Covid-19 is believed to spread from person to person through small droplets that are produced when an infected patient sneezes or coughs.</p>
<p>The CDC warns that it is most likely that the cases in the United States will rise.</p>
<h2>Prevention</h2>
<p>To prevent the spread of the Covid-19 and other viruses the CDC recommends the following. To see all the recommendation of the CDC please go to <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html">https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html</a></p>
<ul>
<li>Wash your hands regularly</li>
<li>Avoid touching your face with unwashed hands</li>
<li>Disinfect surfaces regularly</li>
<li>Avoid close contact with anyone who is sick</li>
<li>Cover your mouth when you cough or sneeze</li>
<li>Stay home if you are sick</li>
</ul>

<h2>What To Do If You Are Sick</h2>
<p>If you exhibit Covid-19 symptoms, please contact a local health authority. If you are on campus, please contact the student health center for an appointment rather than coming into the building to do so. You can contact the student health office at 660-831-4012 or email vogelsmeierc@moval.edu.</p>
<p>If you have a fever, cough, or difficulty breathing AND have traveled in the past 14 days to one of areas where a COVID-19 outbreak has occurred, OR you believe you may have been exposed to or infected with the novel coronavirus, you should:</p>
<ul>
<li>Stay home except to get medical care. Do not go to work, school, or public areas.</li>
<li>Seek medical advice. Call ahead to the clinic or doctor’s office before you go and tell them you may have COVID-19. This will ensure health care staff are prepared for your arrival, and they will provide instructions to limit exposure to others.</li>
<li>Students should call the student health office at 660-831-4012.<br />
Employees should call their family practitioner or Saline County Health Department at 660-886-3434.</li>
<li>Do not travel on public transportation while sick.</li>
<li>Cover your mouth and nose with a tissue or your sleeve (not your hands) when coughing or sneezing.</li>
<li>Wash hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds to avoid spreading the virus to others.</li>
<li>Wash your hands with soap and water immediately after coughing, sneezing or blowing your nose. If soap and water are not readily available, you can use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains 60%–95% alcohol.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Campus Communications</h2>
<p>Missouri Valley College will communicate updates via campus email and on this page. Any school closings will be communicated via MVC&#8217;s text alert system, campus email and MVC social media.</p>
<p><em>Updates from the CDC may be found at www.cdc.gov/coronavirus and the state&#8217;s website at www.health.mo.gov/coronavirus.</em></p>
