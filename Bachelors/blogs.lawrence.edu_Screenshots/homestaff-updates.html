<p>The CDC recommends that all individuals monitor their health for the symptoms of COVID-19. This is especially important if you are leaving your home for purposes of running essential errands or going to the workplace.  </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To assist employees (faculty, staff, and student), the University has created a <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.lawrence.edu/mw/COVID-19%20Self-Observation%20Questionnaire" target="_blank"><strong>Daily COVID-19 Self-Observation Questionnaire</strong></a>. The purpose of this questionnaire is for you to self-observe your health prior to coming to work each day. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This is a measure put in place to protect yourself and others based on criteria from the CDC. This should be used as a personal tool to help track symptoms and temperature. This document does not need to be submitted to anyone at Lawrence.  </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Once you begin your workday, continue to observe yourself for any changes such as fever, coughing and/or difficulty breathing. If you develop symptoms throughout the day, go home, review symptoms, notify your supervisor/department chair, and utilize the CDC self-checker system for further guidance at <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/symptoms-testing/symptoms.html" target="_blank">https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/symptoms-testing/symptoms.html</a></p>

<p>Dear Lawrentians,</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I hope that you and your loved ones are well in your homes, on campus, across the nation, and around the world. Things are going well on campus. But I miss the energy that Spring Term brings when you are all here:  ensembles and theater performances, senior recitals, athletic competitions, research and art presentations, LUaroo and other community gatherings to attend. Most importantly, I miss the impromptu interactions I had with students, faculty and staff each day. I know I am not alone in a feeling of loss of these truly Lawrentian moments.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With midterms almost complete, we now turn our thoughts to fall and our hopes for gathering again as a community enriched by collaborations and supportive relationships among students, faculty, and staff, and by a campus culture wonderfully alive. We hope to welcome students back to Appleton this fall, if federal and state policies allow, even though we also need to develop contingency plans … just in case. If we are allowed to gather again in September, we will have rules in place that will foster a safer environment in response to the pandemic. We plan to make a final decision about the fall term before the end of July. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Until then we will continue to make preparations for a reimagined re-union on campus, and a fall experience that embraces both community and physical distance. It is likely that fall term will begin two to three weeks later than our scheduled start date of September 7. This potential change to our academic calendar gives us more time to develop—in association with some of the state’s leading health care researchers and advisors—appropriate protocols to ensure the health and safety of our students, faculty and staff, as well as the greater Appleton community.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Lawrence’s leadership team, including the President’s Cabinet and COVID-19 Management Team, are currently working with the University’s shared governance to develop a spectrum of scenarios for fall term. The range of scenarios includes on-campus learning as noted above, a second term of distance learning, and a mixed model featuring both on-campus and home-based instruction. Each scenario will aim to provide our students with the best educational experience possible, no matter the circumstances. Last week we announced our plans for summer. You can find that information <a href="https://blogs.lawrence.edu/covid-19/2020/05/07/on-campus-summer-programs-activities-may-7/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>. If you have questions about this or any other matter, please reach out to the appropriate office, faculty advisor, or supervisor. Communication is essential as we determine the changes ahead.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>COVID-19 is not the first pandemic that Lawrence has had to endure and overcome. The 1918 influenza outbreak also brought with it public health concerns and operational challenges that reached us here in Appleton. While the circumstances 100 years ago might have been different, the impact on teaching and learning for our student body is in many ways the same. We must strive to keep our campus community safe, while also preserving the University’s mission and rich, inclusive learning environment.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Thanks to aggressive state-wide actions, the influenza outbreak took less of a toll in Wisconsin than in other areas of the country. We are also grateful that, just as in 1918, our own current efforts are making a difference in preventing the spread of COVID-19. This success, along with the ingenuity of our students, faculty, and staff, brings me hope. I promise you that the University’s leadership will continue to work to ensure that we keep our community safe and that Lawrence continues to share its light with the world.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Be well and make choices that keep others well.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Yours,</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Mark</p>

<p>Dear Lawrentians, </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>More than a month since Lawrence announced it was moving to remote learning and nearly three weeks into this unprecedented spring term, we write today to share some good news: our efforts to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 are working!  </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Thanks to Wisconsin’s Safer at Home order and our individual commitments to physical distancing, our state has seen a decrease in the exponential growth in the number of COVID-19 cases since the order was put into place on March 25. According to the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.dhs.wisconsin.gov/covid-19/prepare.htm" target="_blank">Wisconsin Department of Health Services (DHS),</a> the rate of infections doubling moved from 3.4 days in early March to approximately 12 days at this time. In addition, the model created by the DHS projected Wisconsin having between 440 and 1,500 deaths from the 22,000 COVID-19 infections by April 8. As of April 21, 242 individuals have passed away in our state. Every death from this virus is one too many, but our efforts to flatten the curve through physical distancing shows that at least 200 lives, and perhaps as many as 1,400 lives, have been saved. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Thanks to this news, Governor Evers announced on Monday a plan to safely reopen Wisconsin. Called Badger <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://content.govdelivery.com/attachments/WIGOV/2020/04/20/file_attachments/1431305/Badger%20Bounce%20Back%20PlanFINAL.pdf" target="_blank">Bounce Back</a>, the plan outlines a phased reopening of our state, guided by data and an ongoing commitment to continue to limit physical contact between people. As the new plan states, “the challenge is that all of us who have remained safe at home can still become ill if we move too quickly or act without an achievable plan in place.” It is imperative that we continue our collective work to flatten the curve.  </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To highlight Lawrence’s commitment to helping mitigate the spread of COVID-19, the University has joined the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://besafewisconsin.org/" target="_blank">Be Safe Wisconsin</a> initiative. This group of regional organizations, including Thedacare, Ascension, United Way Fox Cities, Feeding America, and others, is dedicated to amplifying the importance of a sustained commitment to safe behaviors to fight this virus. Visit the Be Safe Wisconsin <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://besafewisconsin.org/" target="_blank">website</a> to learn more about the organization, explore resources, and pledge to be a leader in the fight against COVID-19. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As there are no medications or vaccines to protect us from COVID-19 yet, please continue to: </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Maintain at least six feet between you and another individual.</li><li>All individuals working at Lawrence campus are required to wear masks when they are outside or in public areas. If you need a mask please contact your supervisor. </li><li>Avoid public transportation whenever possible.</li><li>Limit non-essential travel.</li><li>Limit social gatherings and avoid crowded venues.</li><li>Practice good hygiene, disinfect surfaces you touch, and avoid touching your face. </li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>All of these actions are necessary to mitigate the spread of COVID-19. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Please also stay in touch over the phone with your family, friends, and fellow Lawrentians as much as possible. Contact us in <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.lawrence.edu/students/wellness" target="_blank">Wellness Services</a>, reach out to your personal physicians, or take advantage of the employee <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://blogs.lawrence.edu/luinsider/2020/03/26/tips-and-resources-to-navigate-covid-19-from-our-eap-benefit-provider/" target="_blank">EAP benefit program</a> if you need any physical or mental health support.

<p>Lawrence University is donating the use of Trever Hall to the City of Appleton for the next four months to help in the fight against the spread of COVID-19.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Trever is being made available to
the city from now until the end of August. It will not be used as a medical
facility and will not house COVID-19 patients, but rather will be a space the
city can utilize for its personnel as needed.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“All
of us are in this fight together,” said Christyn
Abaray, assistant to the Lawrence president. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Providing
Trever Hall to our city is a natural step we at Lawrence could take to support
our community in this effort.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>No Lawrence students or staff will
be in the building. The university has cleaned and prepped the hall and made
key-access available to city personnel. The city will provide its own bedding
and will be responsible for the ongoing cleaning of the facility. City
personnel staying in the hall will have access to the kitchen and laundry
facilities, and free wi-fi is being provided.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Trever is well removed from where
students on campus during spring term are being housed. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We purposefully chose a residence hall where there would be limited interaction with our own campus community,” Abaray said.</p>

<p>Dear Lawrence Community, </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p> Last Friday, community spread—or spread of the COVID-19 virus for which the source of infection is unknown—was confirmed in Outagamie County and, more recently, in Appleton. With the news, it is even more important that we follow Governor Evers’ <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://content.govdelivery.com/attachments/WIGOV/2020/03/24/file_attachments/1409408/Health%20Order%20%2312%20Safer%20At%20Home.pdf" target="_blank">Safer-at-Home</a> order and the guidance of our local health department and CDC in order to ensure the safety of our community and mitigate the spread of the virus.  </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>The most important thing of each of us can do is to practice social distancing.</strong> Every Lawrentian needs to continue to do everything we can to help “flatten the curve” by social distancing. As we continue to learn more about the impact of community spread, the ease of which the virus spreads, and the impact of spread from individuals who are not displaying symptoms, social distancing is crucial. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Maintain at least six feet between you and another individual.</li><li>Avoid public transportation whenever possible.</li><li>Limit non-essential travel.</li><li>Limit social gatherings and avoid crowded venues.</li><li>Practice good hygiene, disinfect surfaces you touch, and avoid touching your face.</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>These guidelines need to be followed whether you are at work, at home, on campus, or out in the community</strong>. We also encourage all members of the community to <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://blogs.lawrence.edu/covid-19/2020/04/06/wear-cloth-face-coverings-when-out-in-public-april-6/" target="_blank">wear masks</a> whenever they are outside of their home. Lawrence is currently in the process of procuring cloth coverings for students and employees on campus. In the meantime, people are encouraged to <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/diy-cloth-face-coverings.html" target="_blank">make their own</a> out of scarves, bandanas, T-shirts, or other cloth materials. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Please remember that it is imperative that you stay at home if you are ill. </strong> It is critical that employees do not report to work—and students do not visit campus facilities outside of their residence—while they are experiencing symptoms of COVID-19, such as fever, cough, and shortness of breath (information on symptoms including atypical symptoms, along with a self-checker, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.wihealthconnect.com/" target="_blank">can be found on the Wisconsin Health Connect website</a>). Currently, the CDC recommends that individuals remain at home until at least 72 hours after they are free of fever (100 degrees F or 37.8 degrees C) or signs of fever without the use of fever-reducing medications or at least 7 days have passed since symptoms first appeared.  </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you believe you are exhibiting symptoms of COVID-19, please call your health care professional immediately. If you are a member of faculty or staff, or a student living off-campus, this means your local health care professional. Students living on campus can reach out to <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.lawrence.edu/students/wellness/health" target="_blank">Wellness Services</a>. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p> As was expected, our campus community is not immune from the impacts of COVID-19. As of this morning, 12 employees are currently self-isolating after potential exposure to the virus. Five students have been self-isolated since the original spread of the virus; one student currently remains in isolation and is expected to leave on April 10. None of the students exhibited signs of the virus. </p>

<p>The Centers of Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) now recommends that all people use cloth face coverings when out in public.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Lawrence is in the process of procuring cloth coverings for
students and workers who remain on campus. In the meantime, people are
encouraged to make their own out of scarves, bandanas, T-shirts, or other cloth
materials.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The CDC provides answers here to frequently asked questions
about cloth masks and why it is now recommending they be used as the rate of
community spread increases: <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/cloth-face-cover-faq.html">https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/cloth-face-cover-faq.html</a></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Surgeon General Dr. Jerome Adams demonstrates here how you
can make your own face covering: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PI1GxNjAjlw">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PI1GxNjAjlw</a></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The CDC notes that surgical masks are in short supply and
should be reserved for health care workers or other medical first responders.
Cloth face coverings are a next best option.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“In light of new data about <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/how-covid-spreads.html">how COVID-19 spreads</a>, along with evidence of
widespread COVID-19 illness in communities across the country, CDC recommends
that people wear a <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/cloth-face-cover.html">cloth face covering</a> to cover their nose and mouth
in the community setting. This is to protect people around you if you are
infected but do not have symptoms,” the CDC reports on its web site.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Please note that the face coverings are not a substitute for social distancing. </p>

<p>Greetings from the Mudd!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As you know, the Mudd Library building is closed right now, but the Library staff is working with our friends in the Mailroom to get books to those on campus during spring term 2020. Here’s the deal:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Go to Library OneSearch (<a href="http://go.lawrence.edu/onesearch/">http://go.lawrence.edu/onesearch/</a>).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Sign in to your Library account, using the link in the top right-hand corner of the OneSearch screen.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Search for the book you’d like delivered.  </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {"id":331,"sizeSlug":"large"} -->
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://blogs.lawrence.edu/covid-19/files/2020/04/image001.png" alt="" class="wp-image-331" srcset="https://blogs.lawrence.edu/covid-19/files/2020/04/image001.png 656w, https://blogs.lawrence.edu/covid-19/files/2020/04/image001-300x138.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 656px) 100vw, 656px" /></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Click on “Place on Hold.” You should get this form:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {"id":332,"sizeSlug":"large"} -->
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://blogs.lawrence.edu/covid-19/files/2020/04/image002.png" alt="" class="wp-image-332" srcset="https://blogs.lawrence.edu/covid-19/files/2020/04/image002.png 632w, https://blogs.lawrence.edu/covid-19/files/2020/04/image002-300x134.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 632px) 100vw, 632px" /></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Fill it out and click on REQUEST.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We’ll find the book, pack it up (wearing gloves, of course), and send it to you through Campus Mail.  Please allow 1-2 days for delivery.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And remember:  We urge you to handle these materials carefully.  There is uncertainty about the length of time the virus can survive on a book—perhaps as long as 1-3 days—so you should consider leaving the mail envelope unopened for 1-3 days from the date you receive it. Stay safe out there…</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As always, let us know if you have questions or we can be of help in other ways.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Best,</p>

<p>Center for Academic Success (CAS) tutors will be available in Term III. Our goal, as in any academic term, is to provide tutoring for all Lawrence students who request assistance. Julie Haurykiewicz and Kelsey Uherka are available to answer questions or provide direct support to both instructors and students throughout the term. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Instructors, as always, are free to recommend or require certain ways for students to utilize tutoring services (e.g., meeting with a tutor is required before submitting certain assignments) or to set parameters for the type/amount of tutoring assistance permitted (e.g., a tutor may help with problems <em>similar </em>to those in graded homework but may not help with the homework itself). Please be as specific as possible when sharing this type of information with your students. The LU Honor Code will, as always, guide the work of tutors in assisting students. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>All tutoring will take place by appointment (see below for information regarding how students can request a tutor). </strong>It will be up to students and their tutors to determine the tutoring logistics that work best for them (date/time, method of connecting [Zoom, FaceTime, email, phone, etc.], frequency of meetings, etc.). </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Instructors will continue to receive a session log update via email each time one of the students in their courses meets with a tutor. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Currently hired CAS tutors will be asked to complete a survey about whether they want to continue to serve as a tutor in Term III and which courses they are available to tutor. Kelsey and Julie will be happy to share this information with you so that you can list tutors’ names on your course Moodle site and/or recommend specific tutors to your students. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Please check with Julie and/or Kelsey about which tutors are available to support your courses in Term III. New tutors may be hired as needed. However, only students taking courses in Term III at LU can serve as tutors (e.g., students on leave in Term III are ineligible to be employed as tutors for tax reasons). </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>The best ways for students to get connected with a tutor in Term III are as follows: </strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>1. Students should contact a tutor directly whenever possible. Please list the names of tutors on your course Moodle site. Julie and Kelsey will share tutors’ names with you. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>2. If a student wants to work with the same tutor throughout the term, they can simply make arrangements with the tutor about how meet in an ongoing manner. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>3. To request a tutor more generally (for any subject/assignment in which a tutor has not already been identified), a student can use the tutor request form in Voyager (a direct link is also available on the CAS website and in Voyager under the Student Services tab—&gt;Academic Resources &amp; Services link—&gt;Tutor Request form). Julie and Kelsey will monitor requests in Voyager and assign them to tutors each day. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>4. If a student experiences difficulty in connecting with a tutor, they should contact Julie and Kelsey directly. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you have questions or concerns related to tutoring, please contact Julie and/or Kelsey. We will provide a document similar to this one for students. Take care and be well! </p>

<p>The building closures and hours limitations announced last week are intended not only to reduce personal contact but also to allow cleaning crews to focus their energies on more frequent and intensive cleaning of places that remain in use, especially areas where higher traffic is unavoidable. Campus Services has stepped up cleaning routines in spaces that remain open.</p>

<p>Those who are able to work from home can help by working remotely as much as possible, to minimize risk for colleagues who cannot work from home and to further reduce burden on our custodial staff. </p>

<p>We are reaching out to provide an update on developments regarding the COVID-19 virus.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Lawrence health officials were notified on Sunday, March 22, that a parent who was on campus Thursday, March 19, to help their child move out has since tested positive for COVID-19. The parent was on campus for approximately 90 minutes (11 a.m. to 12:30 p.m.) and helped with a student move-out in Hiett Hall. The parent may have had brief interactions with staff members who were assisting with check-out process, and two students also reported they may have been in contact with the parent. The interactions were limited. Lawrence was awaiting confirmed notification of everyone who may have been in the vicinity of the parent before sharing this information more broadly. That notification process is now complete.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Public health officials from the county in which the family lives will be in touch with all those who may have had contact and will provide further guidance. Our local health department believes this is a low-risk situation; however, in an abundance of caution, we thought it best to notify the Lawrence community at this time. If you believe you may have been in contact with the parent, please contact Lawrence’s Health Services office at 920-832-6574 or email <a href="mailto:wellnessservices@lawrence.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wellnessservices@lawrence.edu</a>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We wish the parent involved a speedy recovery and the rest of the family good health. Our thoughts and good wishes are with everyone in our Lawrence community as we do all we can to help mitigate the spread of this virus while ensuring our commitment to Lawrence students, faculty, staff, and extended family remain intact. As the history of this infection shows, it is proving impossible to halt its spread. Our goal now is to help slow transmission and to ensure the health and safety of those Lawrentians who remain on campus.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Lawrence continues to limit access to campus and follow recommendations from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in cleaning and sanitizing shared spaces. That has included limiting as much as possible access to residence halls during student move-outs. Many facilities on campus are closed, while others have restricted access to allow for more regular cleaning of areas where there is less avoidable traffic. See details <a href="https://blogs.lawrence.edu/covid-19/2020/03/20/access-to-campus-buildings-to-be-limited-facilities-closed-to-visitors-march-20/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Take steps to avoid becoming ill: </strong>As a reminder, the following recommendations from CDC can help limit the spread of the virus: <br><br></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Avoid close contact with people who are sick.  </li><li>Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth. </li><li>Stay home when you are sick. </li><li>Cover your cough or sneeze with your elbow or a tissue, then throw the tissue in the trash. </li><li>Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the bathroom; before eating; and after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing. (If soap and water are not readily available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol.) </li><li>Always wash hands with soap and water if your hands are visibly dirty. </li><li>Clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces using a regular household cleaning spray or wipe.</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>What to do if you think you might have COVID-19: </strong>Before going to your health care clinic, call your health care professional if you feel sick with fever, cough, or have difficulty breathing, AND have been in close contact with a person known to have COVID-19, or have recently traveled from an area with ongoing spread of COVID-19. If you are a member of faculty or staff, or a student living off-campus, this means your local health care professional. Students living on campus can reach out to Wellness Services. Your health care professional will work with your state’s public health department and CDC to determine if you need to be tested for COVID-19. Information on health services at Lawrence can be found at <a href="https://www.lawrence.edu/students/wellness/health" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">www.lawrence.edu/students/wellness/health</a>.  </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>A reminder:</strong> Wellness Services-Health is available for consultation to students from campus or home Monday-Friday, 8 a.m.-4 p.m. If questions arise after-hours, call Nurse Direct (24-hour medical advice) at 920-738-2230. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<p>The following is an update on access to Lawrence University facilities as
the University looks to mitigate the spread of COVID-19. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The COVID-19 Management Team knows the changes listed below will be
difficult as we all continue to navigate this global pandemic. Thank you for
your willingness to support one another and to stay committed to our students
and to each other.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The health and safety of our Lawrence community is paramount as we make
decisions about how to move forward while working to stem any spread of the virus.
Cleaning and sanitizing spaces that are still being used by on-campus community
members is a top priority.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>All faculty and staff who have the ability to work from home are encouraged to do so. Please work with your supervisor to make appropriate accommodations. <em>See earlier message from HR <a href="https://blogs.lawrence.edu/covid-19/2020/03/18/staff-and-faculty-update-from-hr-director-tina-harrig-march-18/">here</a>. </em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With that as the backdrop, we are announcing today that <strong>campus will be closed to all visitors beginning immediately. </strong>Only students staying on campus, faculty, and staff will be allowed on campus, and hours and access will be limited. Parents who are here to move their student out of a residence have been asked to remain in their vehicles. Staff members are assisting students in the packing of their vehicles. <em>See move-out instructions <a href="https://blogs.lawrence.edu/covid-19/home/faq/move-out-instructions/">here</a>.</em> (Note that there will be certain vendors and contractors permitted on campus on a case-by-case basis and with appropriate isolation of work areas and enhanced cleaning procedures.)</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Buildings will be locked:</strong> With the exception of Brokaw Central (see details below) and the Wellness Center (see details below), all buildings on campus will be locked daily, allowing only for card-swipe access. That access should only take place between 8 a.m. and 5 p.m. weekdays (see details below) unless granted permission.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Campus
facilities off limits after 5 p.m.:</strong> Effective immediately, all academic, office, and satellite buildings
on campus will be closed to all at 5 p.m., Monday through Friday, so daily
cleaning and sanitizing can take place. Facilities, custodial, and campus
safety staff can access those buildings after 5 p.m. to clean and sanitize
areas; other employees should avoid accessing buildings after 5 p.m., unless
approved by their supervisor. The only exception is the café in Warch Campus
Center, which will be available to students to retrieve meals until 6:30 p.m.
daily (see details below). On weekends, all buildings, with the exception of
the café in Warch and the Music-Drama Center, will be closed. The Music-Drama
Center will be open for limited use from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. Saturdays and Sundays.  </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Some
buildings to close completely:</strong> The following buildings will be closed: International House,
Sabin House, Wilson House, Mursell House, and the Diversity and Intercultural
Center within Memorial Hall. Staff needing to periodically access those spaces
should first notify their supervisor. The student food pantry, currently
located in Sabin House, will be relocated to a space where students have easy
access. Details on that will be announced shortly. The closures of these
buildings are part of efforts to allow cleaning crews to focus efforts in
buildings where higher traffic and shared spaces are less avoidable. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Mudd
Library:</strong> Effective
immediately, there will be no physical access to the library
except for library and ITS staff. Students and faculty will still have digital
access to databases. If you have difficulty accessing library materials
electronically, you can reach out to library staff for assistance. They will be
ready and willing to lend support. Also, library staff are preparing for a
system of “curbside” pickup for needed print materials. The system will involve
library staff pulling the materials for you and making them available for
pickup. More details to come. While there is no physical access to the library,
staff will be on hand from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. Monday through Friday to assist as
needed. For more
information, email reference@lawrence.edu or call 920-832-6750.</p>

<p>As Lawrence continues to make efforts to mitigate the spread
of COVID-19, several campus closures are going into effect today. Students,
faculty, and staff who are on campus will have no or limited access to the
following: </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Mudd
Library:</strong> Effective
immediately, there will be no physical access to the library
except for library staff. Students and faculty will still have digital access
to databases. If you have difficulty accessing library materials
electronically, you can reach out to library staff for assistance. They will be
ready and willing to lend support. Also, library staff are preparing for a
system of “curbside” pickup for needed print materials. The system will involve
library staff pulling the materials for you and making them available for
pickup. More details to come. While there is no physical access to the library,
staff will be on hand from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. Monday through Friday to assist as
needed. For more
information, email reference@lawrence.edu or call 920-832-6750.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Buchanan Kiewit Wellness Center:</strong> Effective immediately, the Wellness Center will be
closed to the public. The health center will be accessible only by students
staying on campus and building staff from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. Monday through
Friday until March 27 and 7:30 a.m. to 4 p.m. Monday through Friday beginning
March 30 and continuing until the end of Spring Term on June 10. The rest of
the building will be closed to all. For more

<p><strong>Warch Campus Center:</strong> There will be no public access to the Warch Campus Center. The café will be available from 10 a.m. to 6:30 p.m. for students living on campus, but only for take-out. There will be no in-café dining. Students will go through a line, receive their food in disposable containers and be expected to take it outside or back to their rooms. This food service will be available only to students. This process is in place to feed the people who have no other means to get a meal. The Warch Campus Center will not be available as a gathering place as the University follows important CDC and state of Wisconsin guidelines on social distancing.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Alexander Gym</strong>: The Athletics Department offices will be available from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. But the gym, weight room, cardio room, auxiliary weight room, and all locker rooms within Alexander Gym are closed until further notice.

<p>Thank you for your patience as we navigated the topic of
student employment for spring term. We are happy to share the following
information:  </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Students Remaining on the Lawrence Campus </strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>All students remaining on the Lawrence campus for spring
break and spring term will be eligible to work in their current or other open
student jobs. Open on-campus student jobs will be posted to Handshake.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Students Leaving the Lawrence Campus </strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The University will allow students to continue working in
their campus jobs while engaged in distance learning away from the Appleton campus.
A student must receive approval to continue working from their direct
supervisor and the leader of the office or department, if that individual is
different. Supervisors should create a plan for the work the student will be
engaged and establish the methods and frequency of checking-in. While employed
remotely, students will continue to report time worked and be compensated
through the University’s payroll system.     </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>International Students</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>International students on an F1 visa, who are maintaining
status, are eligible to participate in campus-based employment regardless of
where they are residing.  This authorization could be subject to change if
SEVP (Student Exchange Visitor Program) publishes additional guidance. 
  </p>

<p>Dear Colleagues,</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Thank you to our community, who has rallied to address the University’s needs as we navigate this difficult and ever-evolving situation.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I am writing today to provide some additional information about University operations in light of the COVID-19 outbreak, including information regarding telecommuting and flexible work schedules, personal travel, and other important information about our workplace.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>At this time, the University remains open to support the students who are on campus for spring break and spring term and the academic enterprise. We also need to ensure that the University can execute its standard operations in this new environment. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>University Operations</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While the University is open, we recognize that the physical staffing in many offices and departments will look different in the coming weeks, as individual staff members will need to make decisions about their personal work schedules. Supervisors will work with their staff to ensure that their area remains operational during University business hours, while addressing the needs of each employee.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In light of the changes to our student population on campus, responsibilities assigned to positions may change. Your supervisor will work with you as necessary to ensure that you are aware of any adjustments. You may also be asked to help support areas of campus where a greater need exists.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>At this time, the University is working to limit access to the campus buildings and facilities to reduce the opportunity for community spread. Campus visitors such as business associates, non-Lawrence employee professional colleagues, and personal contacts should avoid coming to campus. It is recommended that necessary meetings transition to conference calls or video meetings. Discussions around access to campus buildings and other resources are currently underway and more information will be shared with you once it becomes available.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Employee Necessities</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As personal circumstances arise in this fluid environment, the University will continue to be flexible. Work options will be different for individual employees depending on their position, and all employees are encouraged to talk with their supervisor about their specific needs. Potential flexible work options to consider include:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>·         Telecommuting (or working from home);</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Using accrued time off in either full- or partial-day increments;</li><li>Temporarily reducing your full time equivalent (FTE);</li><li>Adopting a flexible schedule, e.g. working hours or days of the week that are not routine for your position.</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Other options may be suitable for your position as well, and again, we encourage you to work with your supervisor to create a plan that best suits your individual situation and the needs of the office and department. The timeframe for these flexible arrangements does not have a determined end date at this time and this may vary by office or department, however as the situation evolves we may have a better idea of what this will look like.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As the academic enterprise is the core of our mission, Information Technology Services is working around the clock to prepare our faculty and students for distance learning. They are prioritizing their time, services, and technology accordingly. That said, we also recognize that staff may need to work remotely and will potentially need assistance making these arrangements. If you do need assistance, please contact the Help Desk, and they will assist you when they are able. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you do not have personal technology to support telecommuting, the University provides an interest-free computing device loan option that may be used to purchase necessary technology, including personal computers, tablets, or related equipment to facilitate distance work. The loan request form detailing this process can be found <a href="https://www.lawrence.edu/mw/HR_ComputerLoanReqeustForm">here</a>. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Social Distancing</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We want to support our global efforts to reduce community spread of the coronavirus, which includes efforts to minimize individual contact with each other. For those individuals who are unable to work remotely, either because of your job responsibilities, you are essential personnel, or your personal situation, you may continue to work on campus at this time while also practicing these social distancing measures:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>·         Maintain at least six feet between you and another individual.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>·         Avoid public transportation whenever possible.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>·         Limit non-essential travel.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>·         Limit social gatherings and avoid crowded venues.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>·         Practice good hygiene, disinfect surfaces you touch, and avoid touching your face.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While these times require physical distance to prevent the spread of COVID-19, we still remain a community. It is more important than ever that we remain connected to one another, even through virtual means. The <em>LU Insider</em> will continue on its regular schedule and strive to connect us all, wherever we may physically be. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Health &amp; Wellness</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We strongly encourage you to be informed and observant of the symptoms of COVID-19, such as fever, cough, and shortness of breath. It is critical that employees do not report to work while they are experiencing these symptoms. Currently, the CDC recommends that employees remain at home until at least 24 hours after they are free of fever (100 degrees F or 37.8 degrees C) or signs of fever without the use of fever-reducing medications.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For the most up-to-date information, you are encouraged to review the information provided by the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/">Centers for Disease Control</a> and Prevention and <a href="https://www.dhs.wisconsin.gov/">Wisconsin Department of Health Services</a> . If you have questions about your health you are encouraged to discuss those with your personal physician. For individuals covered under the Lawrence University medical plan, the <a href="https://www.teladoc.com/">Teledoc service</a> allows you to consult with a doctor 24/7 to evaluate your risk and help with any next steps when necessary all without leaving your home and for a $5 copay. Information on Teledoc can be found in the <a href="https://www.lawrence.edu/mw/2020%20Employee%20Benefit%20Guide">2020 benefit guide</a>.         </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Personal Travel</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We strongly advise you to reconsider non-essential personal travel, as documented cases and areas with community spread are growing rapidly. Should you decide to travel, be aware of the risks. Please continue to closely follow the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/">CDC website</a>, <a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/notices">CDC travel alerts</a>, and <a href="https://www.dhs.wisconsin.gov/">WI Department of Health Services website</a> for updated guidance. Following your travel, you may not be able to return to campus and may be required to self-isolate. You should inform your supervisor of personal travel plans and if you experience any symptoms of COVID-19. Your supervisor will work with Health Services and Human Resources to assess campus risk.   </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Employee Assistance Program</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In times of uncertainty, such as we are currently experiencing with the coronavirus, there are often many questions and concerns about how what is happening will affect you and your loved ones. These situations can often lead to heightened feelings of stress and anxiety. Remember that your employee assistance program (EAP) is available to you, your dependents, and immediate household members. Our EAP provider can be contacted at 1-800-222-8590 and additional information can be found <a href="http://ercincorp.com/">online</a>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As we all know, this situation is fluid and is changing daily, even hourly. We will keep you informed of any new developments as soon as possible, and we encourage you to visit the <a href="https://blogs.lawrence.edu/covid-19/">COVID-19 News blog</a> for the most recent updates. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>During this challenging time, I encourage us to reach out and support each other. Lawrence has always been a community that takes care of one another, and I know that, together, we will meet the challenges that lie ahead.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<p>Take care,</p>
