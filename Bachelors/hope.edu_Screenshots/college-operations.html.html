                              programs such as Summer Bridge, Step2Success and Day1, and courses that have pre-academic-year

                           <p>At this point, it is too early to make changes to the Spring 2021 semester calendar.
                              Per the current schedule, classes will begin on January 11 and end on April 30, with
                              exams May 3–7. If public health concerns prompt us to begin reconsidering dates for
                              the spring semester, we will let you know as soon as possible.

                           <p><span class="acc-subhead">Academics<br></span><br>One of our guiding principles has been that we will leave no student behind. In order
                              to make sure that all our students — including those who will not be able to be on
                              campus in the fall — stay on schedule for their planned graduation date, Hope’s course
                              schedule for the fall semester will include in-person classes and online classes.
                              Some courses, in order to accommodate distancing requirements, may be hybrid, which
                              will feature a blend of in-person and online components done from campus. The majority
                              of classes will be in-person. We are working to finalize the format for each class,
                              and that information should be available to students by mid-July. This combination
                              of course formats will allow students to continue making progress toward graduation
                              and continue living and learning on campus.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p>Two major considerations in our academic planning are:</p>
                           
                           <ul>
                              
                              <li><strong>Adapting instructional spaces</strong>: Given the need for physical distancing in shared spaces, we will be reducing occupancy
                                 in classrooms, labs and creative spaces. This puts pressure on instructional space
                                 in ways we’ve never experienced. Currently, we are in the process of reassigning layouts
                                 and locations for classes, using both traditional classrooms and other flexible spaces
                                 to meet safe distancing guidelines. We also are reconfiguring and outfitting some
                                 instructional spaces with additional equipment, such as plexiglass, and technology,
                                 such as cameras and microphones. The combination of in-person, online and hybrid formats
                                 will allow us to maximize our instructional space, which in turn will allow us to
                                 offer all the courses that were originally scheduled for the fall.
                              </li>
                              
                              <li><strong>Keeping students on track</strong>: We anticipate that some students and professors will be unable to return to campus,
                                 due to underlying health conditions, travel restrictions in their country, or other
                                 personal circumstances. It is also possible that some students or professors may need
                                 to be quarantined or isolated if they test positive for COVID-19 or they have been
                                 exposed to the virus. The different class formats will allow professors who cannot
                                 be on campus to continue teaching and students who cannot be on campus to continue
                                 taking classes. In some cases, due to program requirements, students who are attending
                                 remotely may still need to take classes that are being offered in-person; we are identifying
                                 technology options to accommodate those students, wherever possible.
                              </li>
                              
                           </ul>
                           
                           <p>As we know from the spring semester, a second wave of COVID-19 could prompt a shift
                              to remote learning. We would pursue this shift only if federal or state restrictions
                              or local health conditions required us to do so. Right now, our faculty are strengthening
                              their skills in online teaching. As opposed to the spring semester, when we had a
                              matter of days to shift and prepare, our faculty now have an entire summer to build
                              excellent online class experiences for their students, should they need to make the
                              shift at any point.

                                 confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis. In these situations, we would make accommodations so
                                 that students could continue to progress in their coursework.

                                 our on-campus dining plan for the fall semester, we are following all Michigan restaurant
                                 requirements and all Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommendations.
                                 We also are working with local health officials to understand additional needs for
                                 dining areas. Options will include on-site dining, with specific protocols for distancing
                                 and cleaning, as well as to-go dining. Currently, we are exploring possibilities for
                                 online ordering. As always, Dining Services will continue to offer high standards
                                 for health, variety and convenience.
