<h4>Thursday, July 2 &#8212;<strong> A few updates about preparing for the fall semester</strong></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Greetings students and parents,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As we enter July — just over six weeks from when classes will begin! — we wanted to share several new updates about COVID-related preparations we are making and information you need as you get ready to arrive and return:</span></p>
<p><b>Pandemic Task Force (PTF)</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">First, we are a new group — GC’s Pandemic Task Force (PTF) — and are taking up the work of the Crisis Management Team for pandemic-related decisions. Our members are:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dr. Gilberto Perez, Jr., vice president for student life (chair)</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kevin Miller, BSN, MPH, major gift officer (lead campus contact tracer and PTF coordinator)</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dr. Rebecca Stoltzfus, president</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jodi Beyeler, vice president for communication and people strategy</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dr. Beth Martin Birky, associate academic dean</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cynthia Good Kaufmann, interim director of facilities and director of events</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wesley Beck, a sophomore chemistry and secondary education major from Goshen</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ronit Goswami, a junior exercise science major from Goshen</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Katja Norton, a senior nursing major from Goshen</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition, we will consult with others on campus and local health officials as needed. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you have any pandemic-related questions or suggestions for GC, please email us at </span><a href="mailto:pandemic@goshen.edu"><span style="font-weight: 400;">pandemic@goshen.edu</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><b>Important dates for the fall semester:</b></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aug. 1-11: Student leaders, student-teachers, student-athletes and international students will be returning at various times. Members of these groups will receive details directly from coaches or advisors.</span></li>

<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sunday, Aug. 16: </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Returning students move into the residence halls;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Launch continues for all new students</span></li>

</ul>
<p><b>What will classes be like?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are working on the plan for classes and wanted to share with you some overall points about your experience in the classroom this fall in order for you to better understand what to expect and how we are working to keep everyone safe.</span></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Classrooms are being reconfigured for physical distancing. Seating will be spread out and there will be no more than 30 students in a class at a time (and those will be assigned large classrooms).</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Everyone in class — students and professors — will wear face masks/coverings/shields.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Furniture should not be rearranged in order to preserve physical distancing.</span></li>
</ol>
<p><b>What will student life be like? </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Life is different because of the pandemic, and this will be true in campus life as well. We need your active help to make this fall at GC a positive and safe one for everyone who will be on campus. Here are some points to consider as you prepare to be with your friends, clubs, teammates and other student groups:</span></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We must all work to build a culture of shared responsibility. If all of us respect and adhere to the preventative measures that will be put in place, we will help keep everyone safe and healthy. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We must do this with kindness, support and respect. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We will create opportunities for connection in the midst of physical distancing and smaller group sizes for our activities.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Everyone involved in student activities is </span><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bkFhXwrBZVwDjoND-QrMi2EPUr-6sUeVkuk4tGF_tsA/edit"><span style="font-weight: 400;">expected to follow our mask policy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at all times. Student Life staff will be wearing masks or face shields.</span></li>
</ol>
<p><b>Study-Service Term (SST) updates</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, it is still difficult to plan for international travel. However, immersive intercultural learning is more important now than ever. While we decided to cancel the Spring SST unit to Ecuador due to the uncertainties, we are moving forward at this time with plans to go abroad in May Term and Summer 2021. Though the summer 2021 Ecuador unit is full, there are still spots available in the Senegal unit (which requires two semesters of college French, fall and spring). You can also sign up for China (Fall 2021) and Indonesia (Spring 2022). Experiential and immersive shorter term options in the United States and locally are also available next year (</span><a href="https://www.goshen.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/25/2020/06/SST_options_2020-22_revised_6_30_20.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">see this flyer for options</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">). We are working on developing a yearlong Global Public Health Virtual Practicum with Mennonite Central Committee partners and will run the local SST “Dreams and Journeys: Immigrants and Refugees” in the spring if there is enough interest. Please contact Jan Shetler (</span><a href="mailto:jans@goshen.edu"><span style="font-weight: 400;">jans@goshen.edu</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">) if you want to explore any of these or other options from outside providers. Don&#8217;t miss this opportunity to explore global citizenship up close. </span></p>
<p><b>Mark your calendars: July 14 Presidential Town Hall</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We invite you to another Presidential Town Hall meeting </span><a href="https://zoom.us/j/95446342059"><span style="font-weight: 400;">via this Zoom link</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for all students (current and incoming), parents and guardians Tuesday, July 14 from 1-2 p.m. EDT. We will share further information and give you an opportunity to ask your questions. You can submit questions or issues you would like us to cover in advance </span><a href="https://forms.gle/wJpWiBELeepvcyoW7"><span style="font-weight: 400;">here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and we will also respond to questions raised during the meeting. We’ll record it for those who can’t attend, but we look forward to seeing many of you then.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Be well and stay connected.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thanks,</span></p>

<h4>Monday, June 15 &#8212; Initial update on plans for fall athletics</h4>
<p>Greetings,</p>
<p>I am pleased to share an important update about plans for <span class="il">athletics</span> in Fall 2020-21.</p>
<p>We will welcome our fall student-athletes back to campus on Friday, Aug. 7. Following <a href="https://www.naia.org/general/2019-20/releases/Announcements_Updates/2020_Fall_Sports_Update" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.naia.org/general/2019-20/releases/Announcements_Updates/2020_Fall_Sports_Update&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1593106307682000&amp;usg=AFQjCNElEpCPLHT9iQqBaJtpciahmqQ1lw">the NAIA’s announcement of a revised fall sports calendar</a> earlier this month, the first official day of practice will be Saturday, Aug. 15. Until that date, teams will conduct conditioning and other off-the-field activities under the direction of GC’s fall head coaches.</p>
<p>The new NAIA calendar permits regular-season play to begin on Saturday, Sept. 5. Due to the shortened fall season, the cross country, soccer and women’s volleyball seasons have been pared back to approximately 80 percent of their original lengths.</p>
<p>The Crossroads League, of which Goshen College is a member, is expected to issue temporary health and safety recommendations for the 2020-21 academic year later this month. The Maple Leafs will then release more information about the upcoming season.</p>
<p>In order to return to campus and begin the preseason with their teams, student-athletes are required to complete their pre-participation forms for <span class="il">athletic</span> training and sports information by Aug. 1:</p>

<h4>Friday, May 29 &#8212; <strong>Important updates about our fall plans</strong></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Greetings all,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are so eager to see you all on campus in just a few short months! </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the green warmth of summer greets us here in Goshen, we continue to work intensively on our plans for the fall semester. As we are all experiencing, our ways of interacting and moving about the world have changed — even as cities, states and nations begin to ease restrictions. This is true here in Goshen and on our campus, and I am writing to tell you about some of the ways that we will be adapting to keep each other healthy this fall.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I know from my years in public health that our small size, our generously spaced campus and our culture of personal responsiveness are significant advantages as we return to campus. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Protecting each other’s health will require new and specific policies and procedures, as well as changes in habits and behaviors — nothing short of a truly community-wide effort, including altruism on the part of every student and employee. This is required because in this pandemic the health of each individual depends on the health of the community, and vice versa.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our scenario planning task force has worked intensively to map out plans for how we can safely hold on-campus classes and open our residence halls this fall. While we continue to work on many details, I wanted to share with you several important decisions.</span></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Streamlined fall calendar: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We will start the fall semester two weeks earlier than originally planned, replace our fall mid-term break with several mid-semester study days and end the fall semester by Thanksgiving. This change is motivated by the need to reduce exposures from students’ travel away from campus and back for fall and Thanksgiving breaks. Move-in days will be August 14 for new students and August 16 for returning students. The first day of classes will be August 18. A final academic calendar for the fall will be communicated to you soon.</span></span></span></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We have reviewed this shift in the academic calendar with the NAIA, and they are supportive. The NAIA and our Crossroads League will make a decision about fall intercollegiate competitions by July 1. Coaches will be in touch with fall student-athletes about arrival dates and any other impacts.</span></span></span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Flexible residential options: </b>We are offering students who live on campus their choice of whether to live in a shared room or in a single room at the same price. This will be offered both semesters this year. Both single and shared rooms have benefits and are valid choices, and we want to give you as students — with your families — the opportunity to make that decision without finances being a factor. We will be preparing all of our residence hall rooms on campus to welcome you back in this flexible manner, and in addition, we are setting aside rooms for isolation in case students become ill, and for students who must be quarantined due to possible exposures to COVID. We are working with Chef Jeremy Corson and our dining partner, AVI Fresh, to make changes to our dining hall and meal services that will be safe and flexible for you.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Flexible classroom formats:</b> As we return to in-person classroom instruction, we are planning accommodations for students and professors who will not be able to be physically present due to individual health concerns. Class sizes will continue to be small and classrooms will be adjusted to allow for physical distancing. This plan will enable us to continue to offer the rich educational experience we are known for, while also recognizing that we will need to be flexible, constantly monitoring and managing the risks involved.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b><a href="https://www.goshen.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/72/2020/05/Re-opening-framework-document.pdf"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-357" src="https://www.goshen.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/72/2020/05/20_0529-Reopening-Framework-400x250.png" alt="" width="400" height="250" srcset="https://www.goshen.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/72/2020/05/20_0529-Reopening-Framework-400x250.png 400w, https://www.goshen.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/72/2020/05/20_0529-Reopening-Framework-768x480.png 768w, https://www.goshen.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/72/2020/05/20_0529-Reopening-Framework-1024x640.png 1024w, https://www.goshen.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/72/2020/05/20_0529-Reopening-Framework.png 1566w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" /></a>Guided by public health science: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our campus life this year will be guided by a public health approach based on sound science, state and local guidance, and Goshen College values. Our guiding framework is depicted in </span><a href="https://www.goshen.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/72/2020/05/Re-opening-framework-document.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">this document</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">. At the highest level are the four goals we’ve stated to you previously. We must create together a supportive and pervasive public health education campaign, designed to help each of us take responsibility for our roles in disease prevention. We are forming a new pandemic management team, which I will lead and it will include other public health and medical professionals, faculty and students. This approach will only work if all voices are represented, which is why we need student leaders on this team.</span></span></li>

<h4>Friday, May 22 &#8212; <strong>Guidance for re-opening campus</strong></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Greetings campus,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stage 3 of Indiana Governor Eric Holcomb’s </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">stages for getting Indiana “Back on Track” is set to take effect today and we wanted to give you further information about what that means for our campus and re-opening plans in various areas.</span></p>

<h4><strong>Thursday, May 14 &#8212; First confirmed COVID-19 case</strong></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Greetings campus,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yesterday we received confirmation that one of our employees, who has been working on campus, tested positive for COVID-19. We invite you to keep this person in your thoughts and prayers for a speedy and thorough recovery. They are a beloved and valued member of our campus community, and we know your support and care will mean a great deal to them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We also want to commend this employee for having worn a mask regularly and limiting their interactions with people on campus to brief and appropriately distant encounters, reporting and going home immediately when their symptoms appeared, and working closely with the Elkhart County Health Department’s contact tracer. This person will remain in quarantine at home until released by the Health Department.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a result of these precautions, no one on campus was identified in the contact tracing process who met federal, state and local guidelines of having interacted with the infected individual in the prior 48 hours for more than 10 minutes and within 6 feet. If there had been, they would have been asked to self-isolate. We have communicated directly with individuals who we know interacted with the individual in the week prior for a shorter period of time and at a greater distance in order to be vigilant about watching for symptoms. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We on the Crisis Management Team have been preparing the policies and guidelines that we sent you this morning well before this case occurred. It is an important reminder to all of us to be vigilant and consistent in practicing good hygiene and following safety recommendations:</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />

<h4>Thursday, May 14 &#8212; <strong>State guidance for reopening, mask policy and daily self-screening checklist</strong></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Greetings campus,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On May 1, Indiana Governor Eric Holcomb shared guidance on beginning to reopen the state over multiple stages. The second stage outlined began that day, and extends until May 23. </span></p>
<p><b>The college’s Crisis Management Team has been assessing what the various guidance from the governor means for our campus.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> For now, we have focused on the implications of Stage 2 and </span><a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1SsXHrf_aZZfcXflkrqcXY_dJhfQ8VqKI"><span style="font-weight: 400;">you can see that here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. While we are eager to see each other again, we will proceed with caution as we welcome people back to campus. We are working on plans for the following stages and will share those with you as they are ready and we are closer to those roll-out dates.</span></p>
<p><b>We have also developed </b><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bkFhXwrBZVwDjoND-QrMi2EPUr-6sUeVkuk4tGF_tsA/edit?usp=sharing"><b>a new policy related to the requirement for wearing of face masks/coverings on campus</b></a><b> for employees, student-employees, students, contractors and guests.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Please read it carefully. We will continue to improve it as we move forward, so please offer your feedback.</span></p>
<p><b>Employees and student-employees, as we return to working on campus, we also need to develop some new daily self-screening habits in our schedules.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Here is a </span><a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1yO6J88RVz_5s58df9Z-YU_vCmQk6wj4o"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Daily Self-Screening Checklist</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to help you with that. We will soon have this translated in Spanish and Ukrainian, and will recommend some tech-friendly methods to do this. We would encourage you to hang this at home and in your workspace where you will see it daily. It offers guidance about what to do before coming to campus each day, what to do while you are on campus and what to do at the end of the day. The checklist isn’t intended to be turned in, but do talk with your supervisor if you answer “yes” to any of the questions. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Note that the governor’s stages to reopen are based on several guiding health-related criteria. If they are not met, the governor has said that all or portions of the state may need to pause on moving forward, or we may collectively need to return to an earlier stage of his stay-at-home order.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s take this slow, and do it right, for the sake of each of us and each other. Be well and stay connected.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thanks,</span></p>

<h4>Friday, May 1 &#8212; <strong>Apply for COVID-19 Student Relief Funds by May 14</strong></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dear students,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a follow-up to our email last week, we have finalized an application process for the COVID-19 Student Relief Fund to make support available to those of you who have incurred unexpected expenses related to the disruption of campus operations due to COVID-19. This includes expenses for food, housing, course materials, technology, health care and child care. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Goshen College is receiving federal funds through the CARES Act for this purpose, and we also are raising additional funds to help meet the COVID-19 related emergency needs of students who are not eligible for the federal funding, including undocumented, DACA and international students. </span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The maximum amount of funding available per student is $1,000.</span></span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.goshen.edu/emergency/cares-act-student-relief-program/"><b>Learn more and apply here.</b></a></p>
<p><b>The application deadline is May 14.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Please apply as soon as you can if you incurred unexpected expenses as outlined above. </span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our goal is to notify you of a decision within one week of the deadline and provide payment within two weeks after approval.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stay well and stay connected.  </span></p>

<h4>Friday, April 24 &#8212;<strong> Our plans for the fall</strong></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dear students and parents,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I am thinking about the fall semester, and I am sure you are too. It is clear that the COVID-19 pandemic will be with us for an extended time. </span></p>
<p><b>First, watch this video I made for you about this:</b><b> </b></p>
<figure class="oembed oembed--16x9 oembed--youtube"><iframe width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gY4pcHe2Bco?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As I say in my short video message although we cannot yet rule out other possible scenarios, </span><b>our plan is to see you on campus in August</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. And that brings great joy to all of us! </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I am writing to provide more detail on what that could entail. As you know, there are still uncertainties, and we will know much more by the end of May. Nonetheless, we want to convey these three commitments.</span></p>
<p><b>First, our decisions will be centered around you, our students, as well as our employees. The well-being and health of all members of our campus community is our guiding concern. </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This means that our re-opening plans will involve coordination with our local and state officials, as well as our athletic conference, and will use the best scientific evidence at hand. Goshen’s small class sizes and spacious campus are great advantages. And we are fortunate to be just across the street from Goshen Hospital, a highly respected facility with capacity that has not been strained in the recent peak period in COVID-19 cases. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Keeping each other healthy will require changes in our behaviors, and voluntary cooperation within our GC community. This will likely include:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a range of individual and institutional actions to prevent, monitor for and respond to illness; </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">limits on gathering sizes and overall de-densification; </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">offering ways for vulnerable members of our community to still engage meaningfully through a blend of virtual learning and in-person activities.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These ideas are preliminary, and will evolve as we continue to learn about the course of the pandemic, but I wanted to give you an initial sense of what it might look like. </span></p>
<p><b>Second, we will enthusiastically pursue our mission and vision in ways that respond to the challenges and opportunities of this time. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">We will, as always, prioritize and integrate academic excellence with real-world learning and active love for God and neighbor. At Goshen, we are accustomed to encountering the world near and far with open minds and hearts, and a sense of adventure! During this pandemic, our travel and interactions off campus will likely need to be curtailed. This pandemic is bringing real-world learning straight to us — up close and personal. We did not choose this, but we can still practice our values as we learn, serve, lead and take steps toward peace. Especially in this time of challenge and losses, we will cultivate joy, growth and purpose. </span></p>
<p><b>Third, while this continues to unfold, we will stay connected with you and keep you informed. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our close relationships are what makes us Goshen! We’re going to figure out how to </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">be GC</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as safely as possible in new ways. Please be in touch, and let us know your concerns, questions and ideas.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For now, be well, keep learning and stay connected.</span></p>

<h4>Thursday, April 23 &#8212; <strong>New COVID-19 related funding for GC students</strong></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dear students,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As you may have read in the news, the U.S. Department of Education recently announced funding available to higher education institutions to support students who have incurred unexpected expenses related to the disruption of campus operations due to COVID-19. This includes expenses for food, housing, course materials, technology, health care and child care. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Goshen College is set to receive $396,450 of federal funds for this purpose and we are finalizing a plan for distributing the funds to help meet your needs. </span><b>We aim to communicate that plan to you by Friday, May 1. We will then seek to get the money directly to you as quickly as possible.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even though the federal funds can only be disbursed to US citizens, we will provide additional dollars to help meet the COVID-related emergency needs of our undocumented, DACA and international students. We are grateful that our generous alumni and donors are making this opportunity for emergency funds available beyond the federal funding.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stay tuned for more details in the days ahead!</span></p>

<h4>Thursday, April 16 &#8212; May term and summer course updates (from the Registrar&#8217;s Office)</h4>
<div><strong>General May term updates:</strong></div>
<ol>
<li>All May term courses are being offered as an online course from April 29-May 20.</li>
<li>The drop/add date is April 30, 5 p.m. A course dropped by this time will not show on the transcript.</li>
</ol>

<ul>
<li>The deadline for students to request a withdrawal from a May term course is extended until May 15. Withdrawing from a course will have a &#8220;W&#8221; grade on the transcript but does not impact the GPA.</li>
<li>Students may request to change the grade type from a letter grade to Credit (CR) or No Credit (NC) option. The deadline for requesting this change is May 26.</li>
</ul>
<div><strong>For the traditional online summer courses:</strong></div>
<ul>
<li>Classes will run from June 15-July 31. Summer registration should happen by June 1.</li>

<h4>Thursday, April 16 &#8212; FAQ: GC room and board credits due to COVID-19, Spring 2019-2020 (from the Accounting Office)</h4>
<p><strong>Q: When will I get my credit or refund?</strong></p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> Credit adjustments for unused spring semester room and board services will be calculated and applied to student accounts 6-8 weeks after the student moved off campus due to COVID-19. For most students, the credit adjustment will remain on student accounts and can be applied to future semester charges. Students who are not returning to Goshen College for Fall 2020 will have this credit balance refunded to them via Paymerang eCheck.</p>
<p><strong>Q: How much will my room/board credit adjustment be?</strong></p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> The specific amount is based on each student’s room and board selection and related charges. As such, the amount of the credit adjustment will depend on where the student lived, which meal plan they had, and if the move-out date was substantially later than the March 19 deadline. Because spring classes are continuing, albeit at a distance, there will be no credit adjustment given for spring semester tuition charges. There is no refund for students who were on spring SST.</p>
<p>If a student has a current balance due to the college (including any unpaid Nelnet contracts for the spring semester), the credit adjustment will first be applied to the balance due. Any remaining balance due is the responsibility of the student and no refund will be issued. If applying the credit adjustment creates a balance due to the student (a credit balance), it will remain on the student’s account to be applied to future semester charges.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Will there be a refund for May term costs included in this credit for spring semester?</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>A:</strong> As the Tuition &amp; Fees sheet states, &#8220;There are no additional costs for on campus May term classes for students who are registered full-time, living on campus and with a meal plan at Goshen College in both fall and spring semesters.&#8221; Since there are no additional charges for May term, there will not be any refunds of May term room, board or tuition. Despite moving out early in spring semester, students still get full credit towards May term discounts.</p>
<p><strong>Q: I am having other funds credited to my student account for May Term off-campus courses, SST and housing deposits. Do I have to complete an online refund request or will these be automatically issued?</strong></p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> The college is planning to automatically refund credit balances resulting from returned May Term, SST and housing deposits and 2019-20 financial aid via Paymerang eCheck. There is no need to complete an online request.</p>
<p>If you wish to opt out of receiving this automatic refund (except for financial aid balances), please email your request to <a href="mailto:glsommers@goshen.edu?subject=Permission%20to%20leave%20credit%20balance%20on%20student%20account" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Greg Sommers</a> by noon on Tuesday, April 21, 2020.</p>
<p><strong>Q: I’m not sure if I’m coming back in the fall. What do I do?</strong></p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> Talk to your academic advisor to map out a plan. <a href="mailto:ahufford@goshen.edu" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Adela Hufford</a>, associate vice president for retention, is also available to help you through the discernment process. If a student chooses to withdraw from the college, they should work with Adela to submit their withdrawal paperwork by June 10, 2020 in order to receive a refund.</p>
<p><strong>Q: I would like to donate my credit balance refund back to Goshen College for students who have financial hardships. Can I do that and how?</strong></p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> Please contact the Development Office, at <a href="mailto:give@goshen.edu" target="_blank" rel="noopener">give@goshen.edu</a> or (574) 535-7564 to make those arrangements.</p>

<h4>Thursday, April 16 &#8212; SST Opportunities and Cancellations</h4>
<p dir="ltr">Dear students and faculty,</p>
<p dir="ltr">We regret the need to cancel Fall SST units to Indonesia (China) and Ecuador due to uncertainties about global travel because of COVID-19. The good news is that we are adding a creative, new domestic SST unit in the fall and a Senegal unit next summer to meet students’ needs. Students can also choose from the new SST-Alt opportunities we are piloting in 2020-21 or find an SST unit that fits their schedule. We added China in 2021-22. We need at least 12 students in each of these programs, so register soon! <b>See <a href="https://www.goshen.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/72/2020/04/SST_opportunities_2020-22.pdf">the attached document</a> for all of the options.</b></p>
<p dir="ltr">You can enroll in any of the full semester SST options (including the fall US option) from GC online &#8211; SST Enrollment. Students access the SST enrollment form <a href="https://my2016.goshen.edu/ics/">by logging into MyGC</a>. On the Resources page, which is where you should land after logging in, there is a box in the lower right corner called Forms. The SST Enrollment Form is located in this section.</p>

<li><span style="font-size: large;"><strong>Change to use of outdoor recreation areas on campus:</strong> Effective today, all outdoor tennis courts, sand volleyball and outdoor basketball courts on campus will be closed until further notice. This will help further combat the spread of COVID-19 and remain in lockstep with Goshen Parks and Recreation closings. As long as persons practice social distancing, the outdoor track, sidewalks and bike paths will remain open to walkers and joggers. Taking in some fresh air while giving your body and mind a healthy break from the indoors can be a key piece of a strong-functioning immune system.<br />

<h4>Wednesday, April 8 &#8212; An update on commencement plans and celebrating you (a message to graduating students from President Stoltzfus)</h4>
<p dir="ltr">Dear graduates,</p>
<p dir="ltr">We miss your presence here on campus so very much! And while we are sad that we cannot hold our commencement celebration as planned, I am happy to share our new plans for the 2020 Commencement and the ways in which we will celebrate your years of accomplishment at Goshen College.</p>
<p dir="ltr">We are lucky to have great event planning, film and media talent here at GC, and they are humming away to create a virtual celebration to mark the date you all have been waiting for. In addition, we are looking ahead to create a real, in-person celebration in the future, probably in association with our Homecoming weekend in October.</p>
<p dir="ltr">So, I invite you to <strong>mark your calendar (and invite your friends and family!) for Sunday, April 26 at 3 p.m. ET, to a virtual commencement event</strong> in which we’ll celebrate each of you for your remarkable achievement. This will be streamed at <a href="http://goshen.edu/live-stream" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://goshen.edu/live-stream&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1586437030744000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEnMNYzcYReg5CeX6LFNR6UsvSMCg">goshen.edu/live-stream</a> and on <a href="http://facebook.com/goshencollege" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://facebook.com/goshencollege&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1586437030744000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGCVGKaWx1v0HoeUFEWE9qm8blLVQ">Goshen College’s Facebook</a> page.</p>
<p dir="ltr">This is an opportunity for us to show the creativity, adaptability and resilience of our Maple Leaf community. We know it won’t be the same as a traditional in-person event, but we hope to create a meaningful experience for you and your loved ones. This will include slide shows of your achievements, words and music from some of you, a brief speech from me and a reading of your names along with your photos. <strong>If you haven’t done so already, please add the headshot that you’d like to use to <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1qAgn2ZW9CbtaO0xp8QxehjfUFHGzoEmD?usp=sharing" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1qAgn2ZW9CbtaO0xp8QxehjfUFHGzoEmD?usp%3Dsharing&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1586437030744000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHxObVxAcgmgrGMbevXnDXrcvowJQ">this folder.</a></strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">More details of the virtual celebration, as well as future celebrations, are being determined and will be shared in the coming weeks. Stay tuned at <a href="https://www.goshen.edu/graduation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.goshen.edu/graduation/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1586437030744000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEIR0cJDQzNn0X40KQ0NS6jF2wIgA">goshen.edu/graduation</a>.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Before April 26, we will send each of you a package in the mail (sent to your address on file) containing your diploma cover, a cap and tassel, commencement booklets with each of your names listed and a T-shirt. As happens every year, diplomas will be mailed at a later date once final grades are received.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Thank you each for your patience and know that you are deeply loved and valued by me and each of the faculty and staff here!</p>
<p dir="ltr">Be well, keep learning and stay connected.</p>

<h4>Friday, April 3 &#8212; <strong>Adjustments for spring semester room &amp; board charges </strong></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Greetings students,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We hope and pray that you and your loved ones are well. Thank you for all the adaptations you are making this semester! </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We know that our residential students have had questions related to room and board charges. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although the required residence hall move-out date was beyond our regular refund date, we understand that you are facing numerous hardships and we want to offer you all the support we can. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We have now finalized decisions regarding a process for credit adjustment for the remaining portion of </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">spring semester room and board charges for residential students who moved out when the residence halls closed on March 19.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spring residential students who moved off campus in response to COVID-19 will receive a credit adjustment for 30 percent of the semester room and board charges paid, which represents the remaining weeks of the semester after you moved off campus.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> This adjustment will be added as a credit to your student account, available to cover your charges (tuition, room or board) for the 2020-21 academic year. We will issue refunds of the credit adjustments (minus any remaining Nelnet payments or outstanding charges on the student’s account) to graduating students, as well as those unable to leave the credit balance on their account for a future semester.</span></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Room credit adjustments will range from $870-$1,020, depending on where you lived on campus. Note that if you moved off campus after March 19 your adjustment amount will vary from those stated above. Students still living on campus will not receive a credit adjustment. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meal plan credit adjustments will be as follows:</span>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Unlimited &#8211; $740</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">65 Block &#8211; $300</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">30 Block &#8211; $130</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Please contact Greg Sommers (<a href="mailto:glsommers@goshen.edu">glsommers@goshen.edu</a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the Accounting Office if you have any questions about the process and how it applies in your situation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Please note that the crediting process may take up to eight weeks. You will receive an email from the Accounting Office toward the end of this process, with specific details about your expected credit/refund.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thank you for your patience as we work out these important details. We eagerly look forward to seeing you again!</span></p>

<h4>Wednesday, April 1 &#8212; <strong>April 1 (no joke) community health update</strong></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Greetings GC community,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A week ago we shared an update on our community health, and we wanted to again today, along with a resource that could be helpful to you.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Elkhart County is in the midst of a surge in COVID-19 cases that is (so far) smaller and slower than the large urban centers in the headlines. Nonetheless, the pandemic is here. There are 23 confirmed cases in the county as of last night, and 2 deaths. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is also beginning to affect our students, employees and their families. To our knowledge, there are still no test-confirmed cases of COVID-19 directly in our GC community, though we are aware of several presumptive cases among students, employees and employee families. To the best of our ability, persons who have had direct contact with those individuals during the window of potential transmission have been informed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To help all of us know how to respond as cases occur, we created </span><a href="https://www.goshen.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/72/2020/03/COVID-19-Community-Response-Plan.pdf"><b>a</b> <b>flowchart guide</b></a><b> for students (on and off campus) and employees with COVID-19 symptoms or confirmed cases</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Please familiarize yourself with it in case you would need it so you know what to do.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And we would encourage you to visit </span><a href="https://www.goshen.edu/emergency/coronavirus/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">goshen.edu/coronavirus</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> daily for updates that don’t warrant a separate notification, but could be helpful, along with </span><a href="https://www.goshen.edu/emergency/covid-19-student-support/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the page dedicated to campus support resources</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Be well, keep learning and stay connected.</span></p>

<h4>Wednesday, April 1 &#8212; Approved academic policy changes for Spring 2020</h4>
<p>Dear students:</p>
<p>I know this as been a period of adjustment as we all learn what it means to stay home and learn online. I applaud your work so far and recognize the stress that comes with these changes. Faculty have been discussing ways to support you and today faculty approved some more flexible grading options for you to use this semester and May term.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.goshen.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/72/2020/04/Approved-Academic-Policy-Changes_Spring-2020_rev.pdf">Here is the full policy change and some frequently asked questions</a>. Please read them carefully.</p>
<p>These changes will allow students to have some flexibility in the grading of courses this semester, such as: selecting credit (CR)/ no credit (NC) grading option after the letter grade has been calculated for the course; requesting an incomplete grade at the end of the course; or deciding to withdraw from a course at the end of the semester. Each choice has different ramifications and should be considered carefully. Students should consult with their Academic Advisor before making any academic changes to ensure that the decision won’t have negative implications for academic progress and plans of study. Once a course of action is agreed upon, the advisor will submit the grade change or withdrawal request to the registrar’s office by the identified deadlines. Incompletes will still be initiated by the student using existing processes in the Registrar&#8217;s Office.</p>
<p>Please consider these options carefully and discuss them with your advisor. We hope that these will help you complete the semester with confidence.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Ann Vendrely<br />
vice president for academic affairs &amp; academic dean</p>

<div><strong>Elkhart County state of emergency status update:</strong> On Saturday, March 28, 2020, Elkhart County increased its travel advisory to a level orange (from an Advisory to a Watch) because Elkhart County now has one or two COVID-19 positive cases that appear to be the result of community spread. Everyone is allowed to travel, but the status change is indicating people should take additional precautions and be more discerning about need to travel. A WATCH level means that the conditions are threatening to the safety of the public. Only essential travel, such as to and from work or in emergency situations, is recommended, and emergency action plans should be implemented by businesses, schools, government agencies, and other organizations. <a href="https://goshenindiana.org/media/uploads/0/7796_03-28-20-County-release.pdf?fbclid=IwAR1qHDymNtX7Z5dtcF7zkmLepWRt5HjkAyUhRDX6bjPDNV1FrpFn8lj0miY">Read the full release here.</a></div>

<h4>Wednesday, March 25 &#8212; Community health update</h4>
<p>Greetings GC community,</p>
<p>We are fully behind you and with you, as we all adapt to new conditions these days.</p>
<p>Today we are writing about our individual and collective health. As a college community, we continue to adapt to our changing reality; however, <b><i>our number one goal remains consistent: to slow down the transmission of COVID-19, on and off-campus.</i></b> This priority remains, even after we have taken the enormous steps of learning and teaching and working from home, keeping social distances, to the utmost extent that we can.</p>
<p>We must all now assume that community-based transmission of the virus is ongoing around us, wherever you may be. There are now several confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the City of Goshen. Cases in all counties of Indiana are reported daily by the <a href="https://coronavirus.in.gov/">Indiana State Department of Health</a>. For those of you in other states and nations, I am sure that local or state health departments are also making data about COVID-19 cases public and transparent.</p>
<p>As we write this, we are not aware of any test-confirmed cases of COVID-19 in our GC community (in Goshen or elsewhere), although that could change rapidly. We are praying that any cases we experience will be mild, and that you will seek care swiftly if you become ill.</p>
<p><b><i>We each must act to slow down transmission.</i></b> Please review the essential actions <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/downloads/stop-the-spread-of-germs.pdf">here</a>.</p>
<p><b>If you are diagnosed with COVID-19:</b></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Students on or off campus</b>: Inform Chad Coleman, our director of campus safety and student life operations, even if you no longer live on campus.</li>
<li><b>Employees</b>: Inform Jodi Beyeler, our interim HR director and VP of communications and people strategy.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is necessary for now so that we can try to understand who might have been in contact on campus with you while you were possibly infectious. We also want to offer our care and support to you.</p>
<p>We are required by law to keep your health information confidential, while also working to protect potential contacts of suspected cases. If cases arise among us, we will rely on state and local health authorities to report cases anonymously to the public. If we identify that the person might have been in contact with you, we will reach out to you personally. And we will continue to communicate with all of you in ways that are timely and with as much transparency as possible, adapting as the situation changes.</p>
<p><b><i>This is not an easy time, but we stand together on our core values. </i></b>These days require an unusual combination of:</p>
<ol>
<li>Calm focus on the essential actions we must take to stop the spread of the virus,</li>
<li>Steady attention to our work of teaching and learning, and</li>
<li>Living life as generously and faithfully as possible in this strange time.</li>
</ol>
<p>Be well, keep learning and stay connected.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>President Rebecca Stoltzfus and the GC Crisis Management Team:<br />

<h4>Wednesday, March 18</h4>
<ul>
<li><b>Academics: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">May term classes will only be online. There will probably be a few new classes added to the offerings due to the cancelation of international and off-campus travel during May term, those will be added to the course offerings announcements.</span></li>
<li><b>Current SST units updates:</b>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Ecuador, travel has been completely restricted and the airport is closed. Fortunately, our Ecuador SST students are safely at a beautiful retreat center for at least two weeks. Their scheduled flights are on April 6, when the first flights are to leave the country again.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gratefully, we have tickets confirmed for the Tanzania group to fly out on Thursday morning and arrive in Goshen on Saturday.</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Institutional travel:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">All institutional international travel is canceled through the summer. This includes our Study-Service Theology Term to Guatemala for high school students and our Collaborative MBA trip to Costa Rica.</span></li>

<li><b>Expanded Crisis Management Team update: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">The college’s Crisis Management Team is led by Jodi Beyeler, vice president for communications and people strategy; and Chad Coleman, director of student life operations and campus safety; and includes Glenn Gilbert, director of facilities; Cynthia Good Kaufmann, director of events; Gilberto Perez Jr., vice president for student life; and Ann Vendrely, vice president for academic affairs. It has been meeting regularly about COVID-19 since Feb. 25 and twice a day since March 12, including President Stoltzfus, and has expanded to include others as needed. The team is processing updates and recommendations from local and federal authorities, and overseeing the college’s needs and responses in the midst of this pandemic.</span></li>

<h4>Monday, March 16 &#8212; <strong>URGENT: Further campus changes regarding COVID-19</strong></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Greetings campus,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The COVID-19 situation continues to evolve very rapidly. Travel restrictions are increasing, and Governor Holcomb has announced that dining-in at restaurants is no longer allowed. Therefore, we are taking some further actions today and this week to keep our community as healthy as possible while </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">we continue our educational mission. Please read this email carefully.</span></p>
<ol>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Academics: <span style="font-weight: 400;">After today, we are canceling all classes for the rest of the week. Instruction will resume next Monday online. We will complete this semester online. Prior planned training sessions for faculty will continue using technology on Thursday and Friday.</span></b></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Residential students: <span style="font-weight: 400;">It is time to transition home or off-campus. </span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Please make plans to be moved out of campus housing by Thursday noon at the latest</span></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and plan to take everything with you that you can.</span></b>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Residence Life will provide residential students with instructions for checkout.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you need more time, we will work with you on a case-by-case basis.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> If going home isn’t possible for you right now, </span><a href="https://forms.gle/MmoWEJZJDYwXtiS96"><span style="font-weight: 400;">please fill out this form</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as soon as possible so that residence life staff can work with you directly.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The dining hall will continue to support us in responsive ways through this transition. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We understand that this raises financial questions. We will answer those questions as soon as we can.</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>International education:</b>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In light of increasing travel restrictions, we are working to bring the Tanzania and Ecuador SST groups back at the earliest possible time. They will be routed directly to their homes where possible.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">International May Term classes and Summer SST Units will not be offered. These include destinations in London, Spain, Nepal, Senegal and Ecuador. We will work with students to find ways to fulfill the credits they are missing because of these cancelations. Students can get full refunds for the deposits they have already paid for these classes.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We have </span><b>not</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> canceled Fall SST units to Indonesia and Ecuador yet. Indonesian language class will be offered in May term as scheduled, online, to keep that option open.</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Events: <span style="font-weight: 400;">We will not hold large gatherings and public campus events until the CDC advises otherwise. </span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We therefore cannot plan to hold Commencement as usual</span></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">.</span> We will continue to determine if there is an alternative approach to conferring degrees and celebrating this important occasion with you and your loved ones.</span></b></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Athletics:</strong> The NAIA announced this morning their decision to cancel the spring 2020 sports season, effective immediately.
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">In an effort to provide relief, no spring sport student-athlete will be charged a season of competition. Any spring sport student-athlete who was enrolled full-time in 2020 will be awarded two additional semester terms of attendance, or the equivalent.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>We understand that these decisions are disruptive and emotional. In these unprecedented times, we will continue to work daily to do what is best for each of you, our community and the world.</p>
<p>We are all in this together. Thank you for the many acts and words of kindness you are showing. Be well, keep learning and stay connected.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>President Rebecca Stoltzfus and the GC Crisis Management Team:<br />
Jodi Beyeler, vice president for communications and people strategy<br />
Chad Coleman, director of student life operations and campus safety<br />
Glenn Gilbert, director of facilities<br />
Cynthia Good Kaufmann, director of events<br />
Gilberto Perez Jr., vice president for student life and dean of students<br />
Ann Vendrely, vice president for academic affairs</p>

<h4>Sunday, March 15 &#8212; A video message from President Stoltzfus regarding COVID-19 and our campus community (with text below)</h4>
<figure class="oembed oembed--16x9 oembed--youtube"><iframe width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/a8kakgXCXJo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hello, Maple Leaf community!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What a week this has been! Life has changed, and there is so much for us to understand and talk about. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The purpose of this video message is to stay in touch with updates and information during this challenging time.</span></p>
<p><b>These are our goals at this time:</b></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">To slow down the transmission of COVID-19, on and off-campus</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">To protect vulnerable individuals — those who are older or have other risk factors</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">To continue to provide excellent education with as much support to you as possible</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">To support the physical and emotional health of all of you.</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We have not closed campus because we want to support </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">all</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of our students, including those who cannot go home or do not want to go home. At the same time, we are working continually to protect you.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I have </span><b>six</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> important messages for you today in light of the email message we sent yesterday. I’ll count them off for you as we go along, so you don’t get lost. </span></p>
<p><b>ONE: We’re all in this together. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">To get through this, we need to value our own health and the health of those around us. These are inseparable: to stay healthy ourselves, we have to keep others healthy. And to keep others healthy, we have to keep ourselves healthy. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is a very emotional time.</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many of us are vulnerable to the virus or feel helpless for loved ones who are.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We feel deeply disappointed by the cancelling of public events and athletic programs that mean a lot to us.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many of us already struggle with anxiety, and this adds to that.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Facts can help address fears. One fear people have expressed is around cases on campus and students in quarantine. </span></p>
<p><b>TWO: Facts around quarantines on campus. </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As of today, we have no known or suspected cases of COVID-19 on campus. A few students, in consultation with us, have self-isolated due to illnesses that do not have symptoms which fit the pattern of COVID-19. Over spring break one student was in South Korea, had no symptoms of illness, and agreed to closely self-monitor in isolation. That period has ended and the student continues to be healthy. We have rooms and procedures in place for those who need to be isolated due to vulnerability or flu-like symptoms. We accommodate roommates on a case-by-case basis. I want you to know that if there is a confirmed case of COVID-19, the campus will be informed immediately, along with any new actions arising from that. </span></p>
<p><b>THREE: We want you to make the choices you need to make regarding where you live and work.</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Students: You may go home now or at any time if you need to. It is important to let your professors know if you won’t be present on campus this week so that they can support your learning. Instruction will continue and you won’t be penalized for distance learning. Online learning will begin in some courses tomorrow, and our transition will be complete by Monday, March 23.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Employees: Consider how you can change your work patterns to decrease interactions. This is especially important if your health would make you more vulnerable to severe disease, or if you live with people who are vulnerable. Share your ideas and questions with your supervisor.</span></p>
<p><b>FOUR: Increase your social distance. </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Be with your friends and loved ones if they are healthy, but keep groups small — under 25, as a guideline — and keep more distance than usual. The World Health Organization advises </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">at least</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> 3 feet apart whenever possible.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stop shaking hands. Wash your hands carefully and thoroughly. Sneeze into a tissue and throw it away. </span></p>
<p><b>FIVE: If you are ill…</b></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stay home or in your dorm room. Do not go to class, work and other public activities to limit the spread of infection, whatever the type of infection. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you have fever, cough or shortness of breath, call your doctor. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Testing is now available locally if prescribed by a doctor.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In case of an after-hours emergency, Contact your RA, Res Life Coordinator or Chad Coleman.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We have additional rooms available in our residence halls and we will move you or your roommate to a single room if needed.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><b>SIX: And here is something that matters so very much: increase your kindness and compassion to everyone</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, especially to people whose home countries — by birth or association — have already been hard hit. It is a global pandemic. We are all in this together</span>.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are obviously connected now in ways that are dangerous — AND we can continue to be connected in ways that will help us stay well in body and spirit. We need social distance AND social solidarity.</span></p>
<p><b>So consider these options:</b></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spend time outside in nature. Hug a tree. Kiss the ground. Take a walk or a run with a friend.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Be joyful! Be funny — even while we are also sad and sobered. Last night, Kevin and I read aloud our favorite Winnie the Pooh story: The one in which Kanga and Roo come to the forest and Piglet has a bath. Do the quirky things that make you laugh.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stay informed, but don’t follow the news obsessively. This is really a challenge for me! So I have started this practice: when I compulsively go to my phone or a news site, I try to pause and pray for a specific person.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nurture your faith: pray, meditate, read Scripture, sing!</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Remember that God works for good in all things. Do justice, love mercy, walk humbly with your God.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thank the people who are working extra hard in very difficult circumstances: our custodians, the people providing good food for you, people making sure our technology systems are working well, the people who are showing up to care and teach in new ways.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s use the time freed up by all the canceled events to find new and creative ways to stay connected and care for one another — whether working or learning on campus or at home. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you have a good idea for how we can best support one another and our broader community, please let me know at </span><a href="mailto:president@goshen.edu"><span style="font-weight: 400;">president@goshen.edu</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Be well, keep learning, and stay connected. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bye for now!</span></p>
<p>&#8212; President Rebecca Stoltzfus</p>

<h4>Friday, March 13 &#8212;<strong> Important campus update about COVID-19 action plan</strong></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Greetings campus,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Goshen College’s top priority is the health and safety of our students, our employees and our broader community. At this time, the risk of contracting COVID-19 in Goshen is low, and there are no </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">confirmed cases in our county. Nonetheless, Goshen College is rapidly ramping up mitigation efforts to keep our community as safe as possible, while </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">also supporting students to continue learning well and to complete their courses successfully</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><b>We are not closing and</b><b> will remain a residential campus</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (dining service, RFC, library, residence halls, etc.). At the same time, we are making the following changes to our approach as a campus in responding to COVID-19, </span><b>until further notice (effective immediately unless otherwise noted)</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">:</span></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the next week, we will </span><b>move from in-person instruction to online instruction wherever possible</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Normal class schedules will continue March 16-18 (Monday-Wednesday). On March 19 and 20 (Thursday and Friday), normal class schedules will be replaced with training opportunities to prepare for this change for faculty and students. Classes will resume Monday, March 23 in their new format. More information will be communicated to you as soon as possible.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We will work to </span><b>accommodate any member of our campus community</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> who has reasons to further limit their in-person engagement. Students should be in conversation with Corie Steinke. Employees should talk with their supervisor.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We will </span><b>not hold large gatherings and public campus events</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Chapel and convocation events are canceled for the rest of the semester and students will receive credit during this period of time.<br />
</span></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>All campus visits organized by the Admissions Office (including Admitted Student Weekend, Explore Goshen Day and individual/group visits) will be canceled or postponed, March 13-April 5.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Athletic competitions are suspended</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> until April 1 and will not be rescheduled.</span></li>

<h4>Wednesday, March 11</h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Greetings campus,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We have been closely monitoring national, state and local guidelines in how we are addressing COVID-19. We are working with local county and city government and health authorities, as well as tracking all Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommendations and changes (they recently created </span><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/colleges-universities/index.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">this helpful guide for higher ed specifically</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are currently 6 confirmed cases in Indiana, with the closest being in Kendallville, Indiana, 37 miles southeast in Noble County, where our Merry Lea Environmental Learning Center is located. It is likely there will be confirmed cases in Elkhart County at some point and all residents and organizations must be proactive and preventive. As we strive to make the best possible decisions for Goshen College, we are also in conversation with other colleges and universities inside and outside of Indiana. At this time, no single approach best fits all contexts. </span><b>Based on what we know at this time, and in line with the advice of the CDC and state and local health authorities, we are continuing with our normal approaches to class and operations, with increased public health vigilance as detailed below. </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nothing is more important to us than the health and wellbeing of our students and employees. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We anticipate that there may be a time when face-to-face interactions with students need to stop and we need to cancel public events or large group gatherings. We will update you regularly. There is no need to panic or cause panic in others. Overall, our goal is to keep everyone safe, while also supporting students to continue learning and to complete their courses. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are important reminders, new updates and messages for specific campus groups at this time:</span></p>
<p><b>Prevention and good hygiene are essential</b><b>:</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue, then throw the tissue in the trash. If you do not have a tissue, use your sleeve (not your hands). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wash your hands often with soap and water for </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">at least 20 seconds</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, especially after going to the bathroom; before eating; and after blowing your nose, coughing or sneezing. </span><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/handwashing/videos.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Watch these videos</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (available in English and Spanish) to learn more. There is also more signage around campus with reminders as well.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If soap and water are not readily available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Note that this is a Plan B, not your first option.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Always wash hands with soap and water if they are visibly dirty. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is time to change how we physically interact with each other on campus. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">At this time, we strongly discourage all handshakes, hugs, kisses and even fist bumps or elbow taps. Find other ways to greet each other without physically touching.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth with unwashed hands. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Don’t share water bottles, glasses or eating utensils with others.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces using a regular household cleaning spray or wipe. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Get a flu shot – it’s not too late. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Be aware that facemasks are not advised for the general public. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you need to travel, don’t fly or take the train if you have a choice. If you don’t have a choice, read up on how to take hygiene precautions while traveling.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Practice other good health habits. Get plenty of sleep, be physically active, manage your stress, drink plenty of fluids and eat nutritious food.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You should know that our custodial staff continues to maintain best practices, including those specific to COVID-19, for routine cleaning and disinfecting surfaces and objects in public areas that are touched often, and they also take extra precautions in areas that are identified as needing it.</span></p>
<p><b>If you become ill:</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Limit your physical contact with others.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Please remain home from class, work and other public activities to limit the spread of infection. You should be </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">fever-free for 24 hours without fever-reducing medication</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> before returning to classes and work.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Note that the most clear signs of COVID-19 are a fever and a dry cough. Res Life Coordinators have thermometers to check your temperature if you think you might have a fever.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you have these symptoms, call your primary care provider. Only go to the hospital (after calling) if you are having a hard time breathing as well.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">See a doctor or provider at the first sign of flu-like symptoms to potentially shorten the impact of the virus, but </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">call ahead first</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Students who exhibit flu-like symptoms (fever, chills, cough, sore throat, runny nose, body aches, headache, tiredness, diarrhea or vomiting) should immediately </span><b>contact Goshen Family Physicians</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which serves as the primary medical service provider for students. Appointments can be scheduled by calling </span><b>(574) 534-8200</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or </span><b>(574) 534-0050</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In case of an after-hours emergency, students should contact their resident director or resident assistant, or go directly to the Goshen Hospital emergency department (after calling ahead).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let others know:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Students: Contact your RA, RLC or Chad Coleman immediately so we can be of assistance to you and track campus health needs and trends. </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are extra rooms on campus that can be made available to students who need self-isolation. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Residence Life staff will assist in providing pack out meals from the dining hall upon request. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Contact parents/family members and let them know you are taking the necessary steps to restore your health.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Employees: You or your supervisor should contact the Human Resources Office to report absences due to flu-like symptoms.</span></p>
<p><b>If your roommate is sick with flu-like symptoms: </b></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Encourage them to follow the guidance above.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Provide assistance to them as you are able to.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Be extra cautious and exercise, good hygiene and preventative measures. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Avoid sharing household items with them.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Monitor your own health closely. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Limit others coming into your room who are not essential.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Clean all “high-touch” surfaces, such as counters, tabletops, doorknobs, bathroom fixtures, toilets, phones, keyboards, tablets, and bedside tables, every day. </span></li>
</ul>
<p><b>Teaching Faculty:</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If and when in-person contact becomes more restricted, all teaching might move from the traditional classroom to an online format. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Faculty should begin to prepare for this change</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, including adding materials to Moodle in anticipation. We recognize that online teaching will be more difficult for laboratory and practicum courses, so we ask faculty to think carefully about how they can manage all types of courses to maintain our excellent academic outcomes. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The schools meeting on Thursday, March 12 and the Teaching Faculty Forum on Thursday, March 19 will provide resources for faculty to adapt their courses. You may reach out to our instructional technology staff (Erin Milanese and Kelsy McLane) at any time. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thank you for your creativity in managing courses in these uncertain times and for doing what is best for our students!</span></p>
<p><b>All Employees: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to your </span><a href="https://www.goshen.edu/hr/benefits/#sick"><span style="font-weight: 400;">available sick time benefit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> if you or your family members are sick and you cannot work, know that we have </span><a href="https://sites.google.com/a/goshen.edu/employee-handbook/section-4-general-employee-policies#TOC-Compensation-Understandings-during-College-Closure"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a policy in place</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> about how we will handle compensation if the campus were to close.</span></p>

<p>To Our Valued Guests:</p>
<p>We take your health and safety with the utmost of importance.</p>
<p>AVI Foodsystems has been actively monitoring the recent novel coronavirus (COVID-19) respiratory disease reported in the United States. COVID-19 was initially detected in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China.</p>
<p>At this time, it is important to note that the known transmission of this virus is similar to how influenza and other respiratory pathogens spread. There are no cases of COVID-19 which have shown any evidence of humans being infected by another route, such as through food supply or food consumption.</p>
<p>AVI is actively monitoring the development of this outbreak and are working with our food distributors to ensure services provided will not be affected.</p>
<p>In regards to preventive measures, AVI has strong policies and procedures in place to ensure food safety and prevention of illness transmission. These policies, which mirror CDC recommendations, are closely followed. The policies include but are not limited to: * Enforcement of proper and careful handwashing<br />
* Following of all safety guidelines including appropriate food handling<br />
* Proper sanitation of food preparation areas.</p>
<p>We continue to enforce our team member illness reporting policy which includes immediately reporting symptoms and restricting anyone with high-risk conditions.</p>

<h3>Goshen College guidelines concerning COVID-19 and study abroad programs</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Goshen College is committed to providing all students with opportunities for immersive global education, while also seeking to ensure the health and safety of students and faculty. With the recent global spread of COVID-19, we want to share with you our guidelines for working with the travel risks to our study abroad destinations. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Goshen College will make its decision to cancel study abroad destinations based on whether the </span><a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/traveladvisories/traveladvisories.html/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. State Department Travel Advisory</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is at Level 3 or 4 and/or whether the </span><a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/notices"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)l </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">has issued a Level 3 Travel Health Advisory, “Avoid Nonessential Travel.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> If these advisories go into place after students are already in the country, we will return them to campus.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Given these guidelines, we have decided to relocate the China fall Study-Service Term (SST) program to Indonesia.</span></span></span></p>
<p>As of March 5, there are no travel advisories at level 3 or 4 to any other pending GC destinations and they have not been identified currently as having any limited, sustained or widespread community transmission. This includes our May/Summer and Fall destinations in England, Spain, Nepal, Ecuador, Senegal, Kenya and Indonesia.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Students or faculty who feel uncomfortable with the risks of COVID-19 will be given the opportunity, within a limited time frame, to opt-out of their study abroad program and their deposit will be refunded. The college will work with them to find other ways of fulfilling these credits, potentially at another time. If there are not enough students remaining in the group to make it financially viable, the destination may still be cancelled.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">SST programs currently in Tanzania and Ecuador, scheduled to return to campus on April 6 and 7, will continue to function normally unless they move to a different advisory level as noted above.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although the risk of contagion at these destinations is low, so long as precautions are taken, we advise students or faculty with pre-existing metabolic (diabetes) and respiratory (COPD, asthma, etc.) illness to consult their health care provider on their level of personal risk. We also want you to know that there could be risk of travel disruption through government actions. These could include denial of entry into or immediate exit from a country or region and quarantine up to 14 days.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Given the uncertainties of this quickly evolving situation, we cannot predict when the CDC will lift current restrictions or if additional countries will be impacted by future advisories. We will continue to monitor the situation around the globe, and we will update you and take action should the situation change.</span></p>
<p><strong>Please be in touch with <a href="https://www.goshen.edu/sst/contact-us/">Jan Shetler, director of international education</a> (<a href="mailto:jans@goshen.edu">jans@goshen.edu</a>) if you have any questions about this.</strong></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Subject: Update about Coronavirus </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(COVID-19) precautions</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although there have been no confirmed cases of Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in Indiana, we have been closely monitoring the situation in the United States and around the world. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the United States, </span><b>the threat to the general public for contracting COVID-19 remains low</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are working closely with local health providers and various campus offices in order to be prepared though if that changes. Nothing is more important to us than the health and wellbeing of our students and employees.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are following</span> <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/COVID19"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)</span></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">guidelines for decisions, including about travel abroad. </span><b>If you have traveled to a country with a CDC Level 3 warning (currently China, South Korea, Italy, Japan, and Iran) in the last 14 days or plan to in the future, please contact Chad Coleman to take appropriate precautions.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even if you haven’t recently traveled abroad, taking good care of yourself is important not just for you, but for the entire community. </span><b>We encourage everyone to take these basic steps to help protect yourself and others from viral illness</b><b>:</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the bathroom; before eating; and after blowing your nose, coughing or sneezing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If soap and water are not readily available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol. Always wash hands with soap and water if they are visibly dirty. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Don’t share water bottles, glasses or eating utensils. Limit close contact, like kissing, with people who are sick. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces using a regular household cleaning spray or wipe. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue, then throw the tissue in the trash. If you do not have a tissue, use your sleeve (not your hands). </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Practice other good health habits. Get plenty of sleep, be physically active, manage your stress, drink plenty of fluids and eat nutritious food.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You should know that our custodial staff continues to maintain strong procedures for routine cleaning and disinfecting surfaces and objects in public areas that are touched often, and they also take extra precautions in areas that are identified as needing it.</span></p>
<p><b>If you become ill with flu-like symptoms (fever, chills, cough, sore throat, runny nose, body aches, headache, tiredness, diarrhea or vomiting):</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Limit your physical contact with others.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Please remain home from class, work, and other public activities to limit the spread of infection. You should be fever-free for 24 hours without fever-reducing medication before returning to classes and work.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">See a doctor or provider at the first sign of flu-like symptoms to potentially shorten the impact of the virus. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In case of an after-hours emergency, students should contact their resident director or resident assistant, or go directly to the IU Health Goshen Hospital emergency department.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let others know:</span></p>
