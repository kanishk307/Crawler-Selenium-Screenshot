<p>Dear Colleagues,</p>
<p>We’d like to update you on a few things to let you know the direction some of our planning is going.</p>
<p>Please be aware that things may change. The College receives information and directives, sometimes daily from SUNY and the State, which may cause some of the following to change.</p>
<ul>
<li>An Executive Summary of a&nbsp;set of contingency plans for the fall semester were sent to SUNY this past Saturday. SUNY and the State will need to approve them before we can make any official announcements, (we do not know exactly when this will happen). Our preferred plan is to:</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<ul>
<li>Compress the semester (no fall break, students go home after Thanksgiving, remainder of the semester online)</li>
<li>Put our large lecture courses online, increase the use of flex instruction to reduce classroom density, prioritize labs</li>
<li>Include testing, social distancing, and masks (provided by the campus)</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The various campus teams continue to work out details on the fall semester start-up. <a href="/planning/">A summary of the issues under discussion by the eight Teams</a>&nbsp;is now available. Please contribute to the discussion and planning via the <a href="https://www.canton.edu/planning/suggestion.html" target="_blank">digital suggestion box</a>.</li>
<li>There is a state-wide freeze on hiring. This applies to all positions on campus, including student assistants (see the previous email to campus from HR on June 5, 2020). Spending has been significantly curtailed.</li>
<li>Orientation will be virtual this summer.</li>
</ul>
<p>Going forward, we will try to post updates at least once a week. Please look for them!</p>
<hr><h2>Friday, June 5 @ 8:00 AM</h2>
<p>Dear SUNY Canton colleagues,</p>
<p>With the North Country now in Phase 2 of re-opening, the College will begin to phase in additional employees to work on campus. Please remember that your area Vice President/Department Head will be communicating with you when/how you will return to campus. Please do not report to campus until they have asked you to do so.</p>
<p>We have consulted with NY State rules and recommendations as well as local health experts to create guidelines to keep our employees safe as we expand on-campus staffing. The <a href="/media/pdf/Guidelines-Returning-Work-Campus.pdf">SUNY Canton Guidelines for Returning to Work on Campus</a> outline the responsibilities we all have to help ensure one another’s safety. We ask that you read it thoroughly.</p>
<p>Thank you to the essential workers who have been coming to work on campus throughout the NY On Pause order. You have kept our campus running smoothly, cared for the students that remained on campus, and worked hard to prepare for additional employees to return safely. We truly appreciate your efforts.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Suzan L McDermott<br>Director, Human Resources</p>
<hr><h2>Friday, May 29 @ 10:00 AM</h2>
<p>Good Morning,</p>
<p>The North Country is expected to reach Phase 2 of reopening under the&nbsp;<a href="https://forward.ny.gov/industries-reopening-phase" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-auth="NotApplicable">Governor’s New York Forward Reopening Plan</a>&nbsp;soon, but at this time, that date has not been set. The Governor released safety guidelines for reopening Phase 2 businesses so that those businesses can prepare their reopening plans.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="x_p1">When we enter Phase 2, SUNY Canton plans to begin phasing additional staff back to work on campus. We expect that the campus will be able to provide an update to employees next week, including guidance on protocols and procedures, in line with the Governor’s guidelines, aimed at continuing to keep the SUNY Canton community safe.</p>
<p><strong>Please note: If you have been designated as off-campus essential or non-essential, you should not return to work on campus until you receive written notice via email from your area Vice President or Department Head.</strong></p>
<p>Thank you for helping to keep our entire campus community healthy.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Suzan L McDermott</p><h2>Thursday, May 14 @ 12:00 PM</h2>
<p><strong>Spring 2020 Residential Students:</strong></p>
<p>The College is rolling out a plan to allow you to remove your belongings from the residence halls. This plan, which follows Governor Cuomo’s phased reopening plan, is designed to minimize density and reduce interactions between individuals to maximize physical distancing best practices. While we understand that you have been waiting a long time to be able to retrieve your personal items, we ask that you continue to bear with us as we administer the outlined plan.</p>
<p>Students are encouraged to check their email for the full plan.</p>
<hr><h2>Monday, May 11 @ 2:00 PM</h2>
<p>Dear students,</p>
<p>You may now request a pass, or P, in any class where you’ve earned the grade of D or higher for the Spring 2020 semester.

<p>A&nbsp;<a href="https://www.canton.edu/media/pdf/GPA-Calculator.xlsx">GPA Calculator</a>&nbsp;has been developed to help you make your decisions. It is for your personal use only and you do not need to submit it.</p>
<p><strong>Background:</strong></p>
<p>The college adopted a pass/fail policy for those who are concerned about their Spring 2020 GPA. If you are considering the pass option, please remember that there will be no GPA, but only credit earned for the course. We encourage you to discuss this with your academic advisor, because the mark may impact:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Financial Aid</li>
<li>Scholarships</li>
<li>Academic Standing</li>
<li>Athletic Eligibility</li>
<li>Enrollment in Select or Accredited Programs</li>
<li>Continuing Education</li>
<li>Honor Roll Status</li>
<li>Prerequisite Requirements</li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, SUNY Canton has temporarily paused suspension and the academic recovery review process for the Spring 2020 semester. The college will not suspend or dismiss any students who participated in remote coursework and completed the semester regardless of their GPA or Pass/Fail grades.</p>

<h3>A Message from SUNY Chancellor Johnson</h3>
<p>To the SUNY Community,</p>
<p>Throughout the unprecedented novel coronavirus (COVID-19) crisis, SUNY has responded as a system. Students, faculty and staff at each of our 64 individual campuses continue to contribute what they can and when they can, leveraging their own distinctive expertise.</p>
<p>I am writing to you now for two reasons. First, to thank you for your courage, grit and resiliency as we navigate these unchartered waters. Though there have been some bumps in the road with our near-universal shift of classes to distance learning, this never-before-attempted experience has been largely a success. That’s thanks to you and your passion for higher education and carrying out the SUNY motto – to learn, to search and to serve.</p>

<h3>Academic Calendar Shifts for Fall 2020 Semester</h3>
<p>SUNY Canton has moved its start date one week later for the fall 2020 semester to prepare for any continuing eventualities related to COVID-19.</p>
<p>Fall classes will begin Aug. 27, according to SUNY Canton President Zvi Szafran. The former academic calendar scheduled Aug. 20 as the first day of classes and was among the earliest start dates in the country. The decision will provide more time to increase the probability for an in-person on-campus Fall semester and allow for an expanded recruitment season.</p>

<p>Dear SUNY Canton Community,</p>
<p>I have said it before, and I will say it again: I am continually impressed with each of you and the ways in which you have met the immense challenges we have faced over the past several weeks. Our students are still receiving the top-notch education and services they deserve thanks to your tireless efforts to adapt during these rapidly changing circumstances. Thank you!</p>
<p>I want to bring you up to date with the ongoing work of our COVID-19 response team and the College’s senior leadership to plan for this summer and fall, even in the midst of the uncertainty we face.</p>
<h3>Teams</h3>
<p>We are setting up eight planning committees to cover the major issues we will be dealing with over the next four months and beyond. The committees are (A) Summer 2020/College Opening, (B) Recruitment and Enrollment, (C) Academics, (D) Student Life, (E) Financial Impact and Operations, (F) Advancement, (G) Debrief &amp; Recommendations, and (H) Campus-Wide Issues. We will keep you informed about the progress the teams are making. The following are some summaries of the issues the teams will be responding to.</p>
<h3>Summer Plans &amp; Programs</h3>
<p>The Governor’s New York State on PAUSE Executive Order is currently in place until May 15. This means that only on-campus essential workers will be working on campus until at least that date. We appreciate their efforts to keep our operations running, including building and grounds, residence life, health services, and food service for our resident students. The Governor’s Office is working on a regional re-opening plan; we will keep you apprised of how the plan will affect the College and its employees and students.</p>
<p>We expect that many of the 92 students currently living in the residence halls will leave at the end of the semester. There will be a small number who will remain on campus due to extenuating circumstances, so we will still need on-campus-essential workers to serve them and to ensure that the campus is ready for the fall semester.</p>
<p>We are also working on a plan to allow students who were living in our residence halls to come back to campus to retrieve their belongings after the Governor’s PAUSE Executive Order is lifted. We intend to follow the Governor’s phased and regional approach for this. A draft plan has been created, including protocols that will ensure that both the students and our campus community remain safe throughout this process. We will be coordinating our plan with our colleagues at the other Associated Colleges and local officials.</p>
<p>There are several summer programs for students that will be undergoing some changes. Our pre-semester EOP, TRiO, and Jump Start programs will be offered online, with face-to-face activities resuming when circumstances allow.</p>
<h3>Fall 2020, Recruitment, Enrollment, and Student Life</h3>
<p>We are considering several eventualities for the Fall semester. As you know, the Faculty Assembly approved a revised academic calendar for AY 2020-21, with classes beginning on August 27, one week later than on the original approved calendar. We appreciate the Faculty Assembly’s flexibility in passing that revision, because we believe this will give us the best possibility of a strong incoming class and to begin the semester fully prepared in whatever scenario in which we find ourselves.</p>
<p>For the fall semester, we are creating contingency plans for multiple scenarios, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Returning to normal operations</li>
<li>Returning in a hybrid manner, with some classes face to face and some online, while practicing recommended social distancing</li>
<li>Returning in an entirely remote format for part or all of the semester</li>
</ul>
<p>Which one or combination of these plans we will enact will depend on the circumstances as we get closer to August. In the meantime, we will be seeking out input from faculty and staff on all major issues during our planning processes. Please stay tuned for opportunities to provide your valuable feedback.</p>
<p>We are currently behind the previous several years in both applications and deposits for incoming students, as are most institutions of higher education across the country. This is not surprising, as many families are waiting to see what college plans are for the fall and if the pandemic abates. Our recruitment and enrollment efforts have moved online and have been very well received. The more faculty and staff are involved in these efforts, the more successful we will be at recruiting a strong incoming class, which – as you know – is crucial for our financial health.</p>
<p>We also do not know whether and how students will be able to live on campus in the short- and medium-term. This impacts our residence halls, food service, student life, student health, and athletics programs. Again, we are actively planning for several contingencies.</p>
<h3>Financial Issues</h3>
<p>As you can imagine, SUNY Canton has been impacted financially by this crisis. We have been asked by SUNY to plan for possible cuts to our State allocation, and as I noted above, we may also see decreased revenues from tuition.</p>
<p>We were in a stable financial position before the pandemic, which has put us in a good position to weather this storm. To stay in a stable position, we will quickly need to seek out ways to reduce spending and maximize efficiencies in all areas of campus, academic and otherwise. As a campus that already runs fairly lean, this will be difficult. I believe that with the creativity and commitment that everyone has already demonstrated, we can find ways to do this while not impacting the quality of the education we provide our students. Again, we will be seeking your input in these matters.</p>
<p>The Foundation’s ability to fundraise has also been impacted by this pandemic. Many current and potential donors were hit hard by the downturn in financial markets, and staff were unable to continue their fundraising travel. We believe in the generosity of the College’s alumni and friends, but recognize that this may set the Foundation back in their fundraising goals, which may affect funding available for student scholarships and special projects across campus.</p>
<p>These are difficult and uncertain times. We are committed to responding compassionately to our circumstances and planning efficiently for whatever the future may bring. We are all part of the SUNY Canton family, and we will continue to move forward together, as Roos always do.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>

<h3>Governor Cuomo Announces 'NYS on PAUSE' Extended Until May 15</h3>
<p>Amid the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, Governor Andrew M. Cuomo today announced all NYS on Pause&nbsp;restrictions and closures&nbsp;will be extended until May 15th.&nbsp;This action is taken in consultation with other regional states.&nbsp;The states will re-evaluate after this additional closure period.</p>
<p>Governor Cuomo also directed all New Yorkers to wear masks or face coverings on public transportation systems and while taking private transportation or riding in for-hire vehicles. Additionally, all operators of public systems, private carriers and for-hire&nbsp;vehicles must wear a mask or face covering at all times while working. These directives&nbsp;expand on&nbsp;the Executive&nbsp;Order&nbsp;<a href="https://www.governor.ny.gov/news/amid-ongoing-covid-19-pandemic-governor-cuomo-issues-executive-order-requiring-all-people-new" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-auth="NotApplicable">announced</a>&nbsp;by the Governor yesterday requiring all people in New York to wear a mask or a face covering when out in public and in situations&nbsp;where social distancing cannot be maintained.

<hr><h2>Tuesday, April 14 @ 3:00 PM</h2>
<p>Dear Campus Community,</p>
<p>In these extraordinary times, our staff on campus have gone to extraordinary measures to keep our campus healthy, safe, and running smoothly. Those working from home have kept our students on track with their education and kept our behind-the-scenes functions humming along. As I said in the recent <a href="https://zszafranblog.wordpress.com/2020/04/09/april-9-2020/" target="_blank">WEEKLY BLAB</a>, I can’t thank everyone enough for your hard work and dedication.</p>
<p>To help keep things moving in the right direction, I’d like to bring you up to date on some recent governmental orders, along with a few reminders.</p>
<p>The Governor has extended his <a href="https://coronavirus.health.ny.gov/new-york-state-pause" target="_blank">New York State on PAUSE Executive Order</a> until at least April 29, and the St. Lawrence County Sheriff has imposed a <a href="https://www.nny360.com/news/publicservicenews/st-lawrence-county-sheriff-issues-travel-restrictions/article_d9bb6716-78fb-11ea-a015-5f4d851b1cad.html" target="_blank">Travel Advisory</a> for the County. I’m including more detailed information on these measures below.</p>
<p>At SUNY Canton, the bottom-line effect of these policies is this: <strong>only workers who have been designated as on-campus essential by their area VP should be coming to campus.</strong> There are only two exceptions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Faculty or staff who are asked to come to campus due to an <strong>emergency</strong>, for instance information technology staff in the event of a network failure.</li>
<li>Individuals who are temporarily approved by their area VP to come to campus for specific purpose and for a specific period of time. To be temporarily approved, the individual must complete a <a href="https://www.canton.edu/media/pdf/Campus_Access_Form.pdf">Campus Access Form</a> <strong>and</strong> receive a written approval for that purpose from their VP.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<ul>
<li>Individuals who have been designated by their area VP to pick up essential mail may <strong>briefly</strong> come to campus Monday through Friday, 9:00 a.m. to 2:00 p.m. for that purpose. They must also complete a Campus Access Form and receive written approval from their VP.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<p>The Governor’s New York State on PAUSE Executive Order mandates that until at least April 29:</p>
<ul>
<li>All non-essential businesses and K-12 schools will remain closed.</li>
<li>All non-essential gatherings of any size must be cancelled or postponed.</li>
<li>Essential businesses and entities – including SUNY Canton – must implement rules that facilitate social distancing of at least six feet at all times.</li>
<li>Sick individuals, <em>even if they are essential workers</em>, should NOT leave their home for any reason, and should avoid contact with other individuals.</li>
<li>Travel should be limited to only essential purposes until further notice. Essential purposes include obtaining medical care or medications, procuring groceries and food, or going to a park as long as social distancing can be maintained. Only essential workers should travel to and from their places of employment.</li>
<li>Those not following these social-distancing rules, including non-essential businesses remaining open, or participating in non-essential gatherings at any time, may face civil fines and/or prosecution.</li>
</ul>
<p>Thank you all for doing your part to abide by these critical policies to limit the spread of the coronavirus and help keep our communities safe.</p>
<p>Sincerely,<br>Zvi</p>

<h3>Governor Announces Relief for Approximately 300,000 New York Student Loan Borrowers Not Covered by Federal CARES Act</h3>
<p>The Governor also announced an agreement with the largest student loan servicers in New York to obtain relief for student loan borrowers experiencing financial hardship due to COVID-19 who contact their private student loan servicer. Available relief includes 90 days of deferred monthly payments, waived late fees, no negative reporting to credit agencies, and enrolling eligible borrowers in available long-term assistance program. The federal Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, or CARES Act, only provides relief to borrowers whose loans are owned by the federal government. This agreement with the student loan industry provides much-needed relief to these outstanding borrowers whose loans are privately owned.</p>

<p>Dear graduating seniors,</p>
<p>We recognize that many of you and your families are looking forward to celebrating your tremendous accomplishments at SUNY Canton by participating in your Commencement Ceremony. We are excited, too! We remain committed to holding a live Commencement on campus as soon as it is safe to do so. However, the current pandemic crisis prevents us from holding it on its original date, which was Saturday, May 9.</p>
<p>We all look forward to honoring the outstanding work and scholarship of our seniors. In the meantime, we’d like to hear from students and their families on possible rescheduling options and get their feedback on how to make this an extra-special event. Please take a moment to fill out a <a href="https://www.canton.edu/commencement/survey/">survey and share your thoughts</a>.</p>
<p>We’ve been in touch with our local hotels, which are offering refunds or reservation transfers without penalty. If you scheduled through an online booking agency, you’ll likely need to reach out to that provider for a refund.</p>
<p>Further Commencement details will be shared as plans are finalized.</p>
<p>The annual Honors Convocation celebration and the Vice President for Student Affairs’ Specialty Student Awards Ceremony will be held virtually this year. Both of the Nurses’ Pinning Ceremonies will be rescheduled for a later date. Please stay posted for further information about all of those events.</p>
<p>Thank you for your time, patience, and understanding. Be well and stay healthy!</p>

<p>On Friday, Governor Cuomo announced an Executive Order that outlined what he called “the most drastic action we can take” in response to the rapid spread of the novel coronavirus, COVID-19, across the State.</p>
<p>Specifically, the Governor announced that the State will enforce:</p>
<ul>
<li>A 100% reduction in on-site workforce for non-essential businesses.</li>
<li>A ban on non-essential gatherings of individuals for&nbsp;<em>any</em>&nbsp;reason, and of&nbsp;<em>any</em>&nbsp;size.</li>
<li>Social distancing rules in essential businesses (such as grocery stores, pharmacies, gas stations, and – in our case – college campuses).</li>
<li>A limit on use of public transportation to travel that is&nbsp;<em>absolutely necessary</em>, and social distancing rules of at least 6 feet during essential travel.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, the Governor announced “Matilda’s Law,” which requires New Yorkers age 70+ and those with compromised immune systems and/or underlying illnesses to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Stay at home and limit visits to immediate family or close friends.</li>
<li>Prescreen visitors by taking their temperature and checking whether they are suffering from flu-like symptoms.</li>
<li>Wear medical masks outside the home, and in the presence of any other individuals.</li>
</ul>
<p>He enacted these measures in response to the exponential growth in cases in New York State. As of Saturday morning, the State reported 10,356 confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus. While there are some areas where the virus is concentrated, it is rapidly expanding across the entire State. The severity of these measures underlines the threat we are facing.</p>
<p>To comply with the Governor’s Executive Order, these rules will be enforced at SUNY Canton:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Only faculty and staff that are designated as on-campus essential will be allowed to come to campus.&nbsp;</strong>Exceptions include:</li>
<ul>
<li>Staff who are asked to come to campus due to an emergency, for instance information technology staff in the event of a network failure.</li>
<li>Faculty and staff who are primarily working remotely, but whose job functions necessitate occasional on-campus duties. These duties should be outlined by your supervisor in your remote work plan.</li>
<li>Faculty and staff who apply to and are approved to come to campus by their area VP for an essential reason.&nbsp;Please complete the&nbsp;<a title="https://www.canton.edu/media/pdf/Campus_Access_Form.pdf" href="https://www.canton.edu/media/pdf/Campus_Access_Form.pdf">Campus Access Form</a>&nbsp;and return to your Vice President.</li>
</ul>
<li>For those individuals who&nbsp;<em>must</em>&nbsp;be on campus, social distancing rules will be in effect, with a ban on non-essential gatherings of individuals in all buildings and at all times.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Governor’s number one priority, and ours, is your health and safety. I take this responsibility very seriously. For the sake of our entire community, particularly&nbsp;&nbsp;the most vulnerable among us, I am counting on all of you to take every precaution and abide by the Governor’s mandates.</p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Dear Students,</span></p>

<p><em>A message from Director of Human Resources Suzan McDermott</em></p>
<p>Dear colleagues:</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, Governor Andrew M. Cuomo&nbsp;<strong><em><a title="https://www.governor.ny.gov/news/during-coronavirus-briefing-governor-cuomo-issues-executive-order-allowing-state-increase" href="https://www.governor.ny.gov/news/during-coronavirus-briefing-governor-cuomo-issues-executive-order-allowing-state-increase" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-auth="NotApplicable">directed</a></em></strong>&nbsp;all non-essential New York State employees in every county not to report to work&nbsp;for the next two weeks. This includes SUNY Canton.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is one of many extraordinary measures that New York State is taking to try to slow the coronavirus pandemic, which has been declared a public health emergency.</p>
<p><strong>Who are essential/non-essential employees?</strong></p>
<ul type="disc">
<li>Essential employees are defined for the purpose of the directive as anyone whose job function is essential to the effective operation of their agency, or who must be physically present to perform their job, or who is involved in the COVID-19 emergency response.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Non-essential employees should be considered any person who does not need to be physically present to perform their job functions, or they are not currently required to meet the core functions of their agency or authority during this emergency response.</li>
<li>If you have been designated as an essential service employee by SUNY Canton, you will be receiving a notification via email or campus mail this morning after which if you are non-essential on campus you will be released to return home.</li>
<li>Campuses can change the list of essential/non-essential employees as often as needed, depending on our needs. If your status changes, you will be notified.</li>
<li>We understand that as we ramp up our online curriculum, teaching faculty may need to attend trainings on campus and seek guidance. For this purpose, you will be deemed essential.</li>
<li>If you are not sure of your status, please contact your supervisor.</li>
<li>Throughout state government, non-essential employees will not be charged accruals during this time and will continue to receive their regular pay.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Next steps</strong></p>
<p>At 8 AM today the Emergency Response Team is meeting to finalize the essential employee list and you will receive notification of your status this morning. Once the notices have gone out, non-essential employees shall work from home, to the extent practicable,&nbsp;<strong><em>from March 17 until March 31</em></strong>, or until further notice. Regular time and attendance procedures are required for illness, vacation, family sick leave. Anyone designated non-essential should call their supervisor no later than one hour prior to their regular start time, to ensure any change in status can be communicated. Faculty and staff may return to campus to collect the items that they need to work from home.</p><h2>Monday, March 16 @ 11:45 AM</h2>
<p>Dear Students,</p>
<p>As you know, due to precautions related to the novel coronavirus (COVID-19), SUNY Canton will be conducting most classes by remote learning for the rest of this semester. You have the option to choose to live at home or live on campus as you complete your coursework. This is a difficult decision in these uncertain times, but I want you to know that <strong>our campus is open, and housing, meals, and many other services are still available at this time.</strong></p>
<p>We’ve received many questions about whether there would be refunds on the unused portion of your room and board and fees associated with living on campus <em>if you choose to complete your studies while living at home for the rest of the semester</em>. We have just received some direction from SUNY on this matter.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you choose to complete your studies while living at home for the rest of the semester, there will be a <strong>credit on next year’s bill</strong> for the unused portion of room and board, and on-campus living fees, for everyone who qualifies. We will provide more detail and clarity as we develop these approaches in the coming days. At the least, we wanted you to know about the general decision to credit or refund room and board fees, and that work is in progress to assure fair and prompt actions.</p>
<p>For those students who are graduating this year, if you choose to complete your studies while living at home for the rest of the semester, there will be a <strong>refund </strong>for the unused portion for everyone that qualifies.</p>
<p>We appreciate your patience as we work through these complex issues at this challenging time. We will send out additional information as soon as we have more details.</p>
<p>On behalf of all of us at SUNY Canton, I wish you, your families, and your loved ones good health.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Dr. Szafran</p><h2>Saturday, March 14 @ 8:00 PM</h2>
<p><em>A message from President Zvi Szafran</em></p>
<p>Dear SUNY Canton Community,</p>
<p>St. Lawrence County has declared a State of Emergency, and all public K-12 schools in the County will be closed from March 16 to April 20, 2020.</p>
<p>Based on current information, there are no reported cases of COVID-19 in the SUNY Canton community or the County.</p>
<p>These school closures bring another level of complexity in an already difficult and uncertain time. The next few weeks will be challenging for many people at the College, and we recognize the need for flexibility to balance our responsibilities at home and at work.</p>
<p>At this time, the faculty and staff meetings scheduled for Monday through Wednesday will take place as planned. If at all possible, please try to come to campus for these meetings. However, we understand if you are unable to do so, and ask that you please notify your supervisor if you will be participating by streaming the meetings remotely.</p>
<p>For parents of school-aged children and others affected by school closures, please be in touch with your supervisor. Suzan McDermott, Director of Human Resources, is working closely with SUNY System Administration in consultation with union leadership to determine appropriate arrangements for the weeks ahead.</p>
<p>We will continue to communicate information as quickly as we are able, and we appreciate your patience and understanding as the situation is evolving rapidly.</p>
<p>Thank you for your kindness, compassion, and commitment as we move forward together.</p>
<p>Zvi</p>

<p>In light of the worldwide situation regarding the COVID-19 virus outbreak, SUNY Canton will be suspending all athletic competitions indefinitely following this weekend's games in Florida.<br><br>We will continue to evaluate the situation in hopes of resuming competition later this semester.

<p><em><strong>A message from Courtney B. Bish, Vice President for Student Affairs</strong></em></p>
<p>After advice from the State University of New York, SUNY Canton will be allowing students to return to the residence halls on March 22.</p>
<p>Students can come retrieve their belongings at any time starting immediately.</p>
<p>In nearly every case, your coursework will be able to be completed remotely (<strong>online using Blackboard, video or phone)&nbsp;</strong>through the remainder of the semester.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To help prevent the potential spread of COVID-19 by reducing population density, we encourage you to consider staying home for the rest of the spring semester. We are happy to support you whether you decide to come back to campus or stay at home.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Students who wish to return and remain on campus prior to March 22 should email&nbsp;<a href="mailto:reslife@canton.edu" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-auth="NotApplicable">reslife@canton.edu</a>&nbsp;for prior approval.</p>
<p>While the college is open from now until March 22, services may be greatly reduced or limited. Campus events and programs have largely been cancelled to help with social distancing for the duration of the spring semester. The college has not yet made decisions about commencement, honors convocation, and other large gatherings. We thank you for your patience.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you had a ticket for the cancelled SUNY Canton sponsored bus we will be in touch with you to arrange your return.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please keep in mind that these updates are fluid and may be subject to change.

<p>The Governor just made an announcement. We are finalizing details with SUNY and will release more information imminently.</p>
<hr><h2>Wednesday, March 11</h2>
<p>The SUNY Canton Emergency Response and Resource Group has been activated. We have a campus plan to respond to concerns about the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) and are awaiting authority from SUNY and the State of New York to enact it.&nbsp;There will be an update from the President’s Office today outlining the college’s procedures.</p>
<hr><h2>Tuesday, March 10, 2020</h2>
<p>As the state of New York and colleges across the nation continue to feel the impact of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19), SUNY Canton would like to share its plans to help protect the health of its students, faculty, staff, and guests.</p>
<p>With guidance from the State University of New York, and the Governor’s Office, we are closely monitoring the spread of COVID-19. College Administration, including the Emergency Response and Resource Group, are discussing the college’s evolving strategies every day. Both SUNY and Gov. Cuomo have made the state’s overall response their top priority. We’ve also been in contact with our three neighboring colleges about their response plans and are communicating about each institutions’ proactive measures.</p>
<p>We are currently in Level 1 of our three-tiered response plan, which means we’ll be continuing to emphasize preventative measures while maintaining academic continuity. Level 2 includes potential suspension of classroom activities, social distancing (postponing large gatherings), and other academic considerations. Level 3 is reserved for a pandemic period and will consist of minimal campus operations, cessation of on-campus instruction, including fully online course delivery. A&nbsp;complete copy of the&nbsp;<a href="/media/pdf/COVID19-Plan-Summary.pdf">SUNY Canton Pandemic Response Plan (COVID-19)</a> is now available.</p>
<p>To the very best of our knowledge, no one from SUNY Canton has contracted COVID-19, or has traveled to any of the most-affected areas outside of the country. At this time, there are no reported cases in St. Lawrence County. The Davis Health Center has issued suggested guidelines for anyone who develops symptoms or comes into contact with infected individuals, per Centers for Disease Control instructions.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/about/index.html">A complete set of recommendations can be found here</a>.</p>
<p>During this break week, the college has undergone a deep cleaning. Our facilities staff are disinfecting high-traffic areas and surfaces such as door handles, countertops, tables, and bathrooms. More on important cleaning measures will appear in a subsequent update.</p>
<p>SUNY Canton will remain open after Spring Break. Classes and scheduled events will continue as planned until further notice to maintain academic continuity throughout the semester. As with any evolving situation, these plans may change quickly. The college is prepared to escalate its response accordingly. We promise to communicate changes or interruptions, cancellations, and overall updates as quickly and efficiently as possible.</p>
<p>Please continue to help us keep the SUNY Canton community safe by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Thoroughly washing your hands frequently.</li>
<li>Don’t touch your face, eyes, nose or mouth.</li>
<li>Avoiding contact with sick individuals.</li>
<li>Stay home if you have a fever or flu-like symptoms.</li>

<h2>Monday, March 2, 2020</h2>
<p>As public health officials respond to the spread of the novel strain of coronavirus (COVID-19), we are writing to provide you an update on developments affecting the SUNY Canton campus and the preparations we have in place.</p>
<p>There have been no cases of COVID-19 among our students, faculty and staff. The college’s leadership remain in close contact with state and federal public health officials. New York has only one confirmed case of COVID-19, and the state Department of Public Health evaluates the current risk to New York residents as low.</p>
<p>In addition to emails and emergency alert notifications, the campus will keep information regarding COVID-19 here. We encourage you to check often.</p>
<h3>Best Practices to Protect Yourself</h3>
<p>Davis Health Center reminds all students, faculty and staff to remember the Health Smart tips to avoid spreading any respiratory virus, including COVID-19. These simple actions will help to prevent the spread of all respiratory viruses and create a healthier campus community.</p>
<ul>
<li>Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. If soap and water are not available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer.</li>
<li>Avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth with unwashed hands.</li>
<li>Avoid close contact with people who are sick.</li>
<li>Stay home when you are sick. <strong>This applies to students, faculty and staff.</strong></li>
<li>Cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue, then throw the tissue in the trash.</li>
<li>Clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces.</li>
<li>It’s not too late to get a flu vaccination. Call the Davis Health Center for an appointment at 315-386-7333</li>
<li>If you are a SUNY Canton student, faculty or staff member and have travelled in or through mainland China or other evolving countries of concern, or if you have had direct contact with someone ill with COVID-19 in the past 14 days, please <strong>call the Davis Health Center at 315-386-7333</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Attendance</h3>
<p>We realize the impact that illness or a widespread outbreak could have on student attendance and ability to meet course requirements; we ask that faculty be understanding and make accommodations for student needs. As is always a good health practice, we encourage individuals who are sick to stay home or in their residence hall room if they are contagious. We encourage students to discuss making up work before they are absent from a class with each of their faculty members.</p>
<p>To ensure instructional continuity in the case of an emergency, all faculty should be prepared to conduct their courses online through Blackboard; if your course is not currently set up for online delivery, please consult immediately with our instructional design team Center for Learning Design, Innovation, and Online Instruction at <a href="mailto:cldioi@canton.edu">cldioi@canton.edu</a>.</p>
<p>For laboratory or clinical practice, faculty should think about how they would handle alternate assignments and/or how the work can be rescheduled should circumstances dictate.</p>
<h3>Spring Break</h3>
<p>On-campus students will have the option to stay in their residence hall rooms over spring break. If you would like to remain in your room during spring break, please request to do so by e-mailing <a href="mailto:reslife@canton.edu">reslife@canton.edu</a>. This e-mail request must be received by 8am on Thursday, March 5th. Please note that the dining hall is closed during spring break. Students staying over break are expected to provide their own meals. However, if you have a financial hardship please make note of this in your e-mail and we will do our best to assist you.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Students, faculty and staff who are planning to travel internationally during spring break are encouraged to monitor official government travel advisories and possibly cancel plans when possible. In recent weeks, the CDC and the State Department have elevated travel advisory levels for several countries, including China, Japan, South Korea, Italy and Iran. While restrictions currently apply only to travelers returning to the U.S. from China, the situation is evolving and new restrictions could occur. The campus will be connecting with all international students this week to discuss how we can support them.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Maintaining perspective, empathy and respect</h3>
<p>While there is understandable anxiety about this new coronavirus, it is important to maintain perspective on its current status in the United States, which has resulted in approximately six fatalities. In comparison, the CDC reports over 19 million cases of flu illness and 10,000 fatalities from the flu virus already this season. Simple health practices will help prevent these and other respiratory illnesses.</p>
<p>Finally, while the University leadership and community health experts continue to focus on protecting our state, our students, faculty, staff, and our community, it’s important to keep in perspective the worldwide victims of this virus and the impact on their friends and family all around us. Further, it’s a timely reminder to avoid stereotyping or stigmatizing any individuals or groups and treat all people with respect and empathy.</p>
<p>We will continue to monitor this situation, and our medical staff is staying up to date with guidelines and recommendations to help promote the health and safety of our campus.</p>
<p>We will continue to provide you timely updates and guidance as this situation evolves.</p>

<p>You can reduce the risk of spreading coronaviruses by taking the same steps as you would to prevent infection from the flu and the common cold:</p>
<ul>
<li>Wash hands often with soap and water for a least 20 seconds. Use hand sanitizer, with 60-95% alcohol if water is not available.</li>
<li>Avoid touching your eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands.</li>
<li>Avoid contact with people who are sick.</li>
<li>Stay home while you are sick and avoid close contact with others.</li>
<li>Cover your mouth and nose with your elbow or a tissue when coughing or sneezing, and immediately dispose of the used tissue.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Computer Lab Use and Hand Sanitizing</h2>
<p>The best method for disinfecting your hands is washing them with soap and water. For convenience, hand sanitizer is available in and around all SUNY Canton computer labs. Please wash your hands or use hand sanitizer before and after utilizing public computers.</p>
