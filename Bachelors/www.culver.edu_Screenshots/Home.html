      <div class="tab-content">
        <p><p>We are all working diligently to make sure that our students’ return to campus is as safe and healthy as possible, and we are focused on&nbsp;providing an exceptional learning environment for everyone at C-SC this fall.&nbsp; Many colleges and universities around the country are making changes to their fall semester schedules in light of COVID-19 concerns.</p>
<p><strong>We plan on starting in the fall as originally scheduled. Classes will begin, in person, on Monday, August 24.</strong></p>
<p>Move-in times and dates have been adjusted in order to maximize your safety and the safety of others by following best practices by the CDC for physical distancing. Below is the new schedule. More details will be emailed to students for check-in.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>August 8</strong> - Catalyst students move in 10 a.m. - noon</li>
<li><strong>August 13</strong> - Football move in; 9 a.m. – noon freshmen, 1 – 3 p.m. returners</li>
<li><strong>August 14</strong> – Women’s Soccer, Women’s Volleyball and Sophomore Nursing Majors move in 9 a.m. – 11 a.m.; Men’s Soccer move in 11 a.m. – 1 p.m.</li>
<li><strong>August 15</strong> – Athletic practices can begin</li>
<li><strong>August 16</strong> – Marching Band members move in noon – 3 p.m.</li>
<li><strong>August 21</strong> – freshmen and new transfers (who are not in a fall sport) move in
<ul>
<li>9 – 11 a.m. last names A-H</li>
<li>11 a.m. – 1 p.m. last names I-Q</li>
<li>1 p.m. – 3 p.m. last names R-Z</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>August 23</strong> – returning students move in
<ul>
<li>10 a.m. – noon last names A-M</li>
<li>Noon – 2 p.m. last names N-Z</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Culver-Stockton College has officially made a fall semester calendar change. You can find the new calendar on MyCulver and the <a href="/academics/academic-calendar/">College website</a>. Please keep in mind that these changes have been made in an effort to maximize our ability to remain on campus with regular, face-to-face classes. Fall courses will remain the same, and there is no need to change course registration.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some key changes are highlighted here:</p>
<ol>
<li>Classes will start as scheduled on August 24.</li>
<li>There will be no Labor Day holiday. Classes will be held on Labor Day.</li>
<li>There will be no midterm break on Monday, October 5. Classes will be held on that day.</li>
<li>There will be no Reading Day between the last day of the 12-week session and the first day of finals, however there will be a weekend included during the finals period.</li>
<li>There will be a one day break between the end of the 12-week finals period and the start of 3-week classes.</li>
<li>The 3-week session will start prior to Thanksgiving, and there will be classes held on the Monday and Tuesday (November 23 and 24) of Thanksgiving week.&nbsp;Students are expected to be in attendance on these days, particularly since each day of the 3-week session is equivalent to one week of class during the 12-week session.</li>
<li>Thanksgiving break will be held Wednesday, November 25 through Sunday, November 29. Students who need to remain on campus during Thanksgiving Break will be accommodated.</li>
<li>The last day of the 3-week session (and thus the last day of the fall semester) will be on December 11.&nbsp;This lengthens the winter break by one week.</li>
</ol>
<p>It is our hope that we will be able to remain in face-to-face classes as scheduled throughout both the 12-week and the 3-week, but this calendar change allows for a significant portion of the 3-week session to occur in person&nbsp;<em>if we determine that we must move to remote learning following the Thanksgiving Break.</em>&nbsp;We will continue to monitor all available public health information, and&nbsp;<strong>we will make a decision&nbsp;at a later date&nbsp;on whether face-to-face classes will need to be offered remotely following Thanksgiving Break.</strong>&nbsp;Please be reminded that, as always, flight schedules and conflicts are not acceptable reasons to miss classes or request final exam changes.</p>
<p>Please use this new calendar as travel plans are made for the fall semester.&nbsp;We look forward to seeing you back on campus soon.</p></p>

      <div class="tab-content">
        <p><p><strong>Higher Education Emergency Relief Fund (HEERF) at Culver-Stockton College</strong></p>
<p>Culver-Stockton College will be mailing the first round of checks to students as a result of funding received through the Higher Education Emergency Relief Fund authorized by the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security (CARES) Act by May 23. This funding provides direct emergency grants to college students whose lives and educations have been disrupted by the coronavirus outbreak. Funds may be used for costs related to the disruption of campus operations such as food, housing, course materials, health care, technology and transportation. Initial grants may range from $250 to $750.</p>
<p>In order to be eligible for consideration students must be eligible for Title IV financial aid determined by filing a FAFSA, and be making satisfactory academic progress. Students also must have been enrolled in on campus (not online only) courses on March 13, 2020, and continue to be enrolled. Priority for receiving a grant has been given to students who were forced to relocate from campus in March due to the coronavirus pandemic, and who have significant demonstrated financial need based on the results of their 2019-2020 FAFSA.&nbsp;</p>
<p>These funds are not considered financial aid, so will not affect the financial aid students received for 2019-20 or will receive for the 2020-21 academic year. The Internal Revenue Service has also indicated that these funds will not be taxable to the recipient.</p>
<p>While funding for the HEERF grants is limited, students whose families have experienced significant financial hardship such as a parent’s extended loss of employment as the result of the COVID-19 pandemic should submit an email fully explaining their circumstances to <a href="mailto:financialaid@culver.edu">financialaid@culver.edu</a> in order to be considered for all funding that may be available for the 2020-21 academic year.</p></p>

      <div class="tab-content">
        <p><p>To Residential Students:</p>
<p>We thank you and appreciate your patience and understanding as we attempt to address the many challenges we are all facing related to the COVID-19 pandemic. We have been working diligently to determine a fair and equitable housing and board adjustment as we complete the spring semester. We want you to know that these decisions were not made lightly and the refund methodology took into account the individual room assignments and meal plans of our resident students as well as the individual financial aid awards of those resident students related to housing and meal plan costs. Adjustments also took into account the date that students fully vacated housing, and ceased using the meal plan.</p>
<p><strong>If you are eligible for a housing and/or board refund</strong>, that amount will be applied to your student account by May 23, 2020. If you have any unpaid charges on your student account, the refund will be applied first to those charges and any remaining credit will carry forward to your next term of enrollment.&nbsp; Graduating seniors and others who do not return in the fall will receive a refund of any remaining credit by September 20, 2020. Checks will be mailed to the permanent address on file. Please direct any questions to Student Accounts to our office email account at <a href="mailto:studentbilling@culver.edu">studentbilling@culver.edu</a>.</p></p>

        <p><p>My Dear Wildcats,</p>
<p>I hope you and your loved ones are staying safe and healthy. My hearty congratulations to each of you&nbsp;for completing the 12-week semester. You’re on your way to finishing another academic year at C-SC, albeit not in the way anyone had planned.</p>
<p>I’m so very proud of the way in which you’ve responded during this very difficult time. It’s been wonderful that so many of you are participating in our virtual events.

      <div class="tab-content">
        <p><p>Dear Class of 2020,</p>
<p>As your president I am heartbroken that a number of the events and traditions that we hold dear at C-SC will not be occurring. I especially wanted to be a part of those time honored traditions with my last class. A class that I have grown so very fond of. Each day we receive new information about the mandates we must follow for our health and safety and of course that is my main concern and my duty.</p>
<p>So as information is changing frequently, myself and the senior leaders at C-SC will make the best decisions we can based on the information at hand. We are a creative and innovative group. And I trust we will be able to celebrate the Class of 2020 in some way, sometime in the future. Be safe my 2020 Wildcats.</p>
<p>Sincerely and with love,</p>
<p>President Thompson</p></p>

      <div class="tab-content">
        <p><p dir="ltr">Dear Culver-Stockton Campus Community,</p>
<p dir="ltr">As the situation with the COVID-19 virus continues to rapidly change, we have made certain decisions at Culver-Stockton to ensure the continued safety of all students, faculty and staff.&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>As of this announcement, there are no reported cases of the virus on the campus or in the immediate community.</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">All classes will be completed online throughout the rest of the Spring semester, which will now end on May 15, 2020.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The residential facilities are being closed to maintain social distancing guidelines and ensure the health and safety of our students and staff.&nbsp;<strong>C-SC is asking the small group of students who are currently on campus to vacate the residence halls by Friday, March 20.</strong>&nbsp;Residence Life will be providing instructions for students to use to check out of their rooms.</p>
<p dir="ltr">For those students who are not currently on campus, communication will soon be sent regarding when they can return to get their belongings.&nbsp;Please watch for communication from Dr. Chris Gill, Dean of Students, who will be providing information and guidance on this process.</p>
<p>Culver-Stockton is waiting on guidance from the federal financial aid department in order to make accurate decisions regarding any financial credits to be given for room and board.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Regarding commencement, the decision has been made that there will not be a traditional commencement ceremony on May 16. Nonetheless, graduating seniors who complete their required coursework will receive their degrees as scheduled. Plans for some type of celebration at a later date continue to be discussed.</p>
<p dir="ltr">All my best for continued good health,</p>

        <p><p>Culver-Stockton College has made the decision to continue all classes in an online format through the 12-week semester which ends April 17. We will have a decision made regarding 3-week classes by the end of this week.</p>
<p>Although&nbsp;<strong>there are still no confirmed cases of COVID-19 on C-SC’s campus or in the surrounding area</strong>, our Task Force has discussed all possibilities and have determined this is the best course of action to limit the possibility of exposure.</p>
<p>The NAIA has cancelled spring sports, and under the recommendation of our team doctor, all practices have been cancelled as well.</p>
<p>Students and parents who have questions should contact Dr. Chris Gill, Dean of Students, at&nbsp;<a href="mailto:cgill@culver.edu">cgill@culver.edu</a>&nbsp;or 573-288-6334.</p></p>

      <div class="tab-content">
        <p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Effective March 14, the Heart of America Athletic Conference temporarily suspended all conference competitions for the athletic programs of its 13 member institutions. The league's Council of Presidents (COP) reached the decision on Friday afternoon.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The decision comes based on the continuing developments across the landscape of athletics from the effects of COVID-19.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">"We have chosen to exercise an abundance of caution as we move through the uncharted waters of the COVID-19 situation," stated Commissioner Lori Thomas. "We will use this time to monitor the ever-changing health crisis and determine the best steps for the health and welfare of our student-athletes, coaches, administration, and fans moving forward."</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Heart sports impacted by this decision include men's volleyball, baseball, softball, outdoor track &amp; field, men's golf, and women's golf. On Thursday, the NAIA National Office announced the immediate cancellation of all remaining winter national championships: men's basketball, women's basketball, competitive cheer, competitive dance, and women's wrestling.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">With the health, safety and well-being of student-athletes as a top priority, Heart officials and the COP view this as the right and necessary step to take relative to COVID-19. Conference officials will continue to monitor the situation and continue working closely with the national office on this extremely fluid situation.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Conference officials will continue to meet regularly over the next two weeks with the next public comment on conference competitions to be released in April. If the suspension is lifted, additional updates regarding conference spring championships will be communicated once information is obtained from the national office on their plan for conducting national postseason events this spring.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Decisions on all non-conference sporting events – both in and out of championship season – along with sports not sponsored by the Heart will be determined at the institutional level.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In addition, as an associate member of the Kansas Collegiate Atletic Conference, the women's lacrosse program as had its season suspended indefinitely due to the KCAC suspending all athletic competitions.</span></p></p>

      <div class="tab-content">
        <p><p>The health and safety of everyone on the Culver-Stockton campus is our main priority. Maintaining that standard is even more important at this time with the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. C-SC has been, and will continue to work closely with the Lewis County Health Department.</p>
<p>Culver-Stockton College will extend spring break for one week, March 16-20, in an effort to limit the possibility of exposure to the coronavirus to the campus and Canton community. At this time, there are no reported cases of coronavirus on the C-SC campus or in the surrounding region. This additional week will give College leadership and academic departments the opportunity to thoughtfully consider all options for finishing the semester through alternative methods. All classes will begin Monday, March 23 via online learning. Residential students have the option of returning to campus or staying home.</p>
<p>Culver-Stockton offices will remain open and faculty will be instructed by their departments on how to proceed during the week.</p>
<p>At this time, there is no reason for concern among students, parents, faculty, staff and visitors. A coronavirus task force is monitoring the situation and communicating frequently. C-SC is ready to implement a plan if the need arises.</p>
<p>Please check back on our website’s COVID-19 resource page, culver.edu/covid-19 for further updates. All students will be receiving additional information via your campus email address.</p>

<h4><strong>We have set up a covid-19 hotline email:&nbsp;<a href="mailto:covidinfo@culver.edu">covidinfo@culver.edu</a>.</strong></h4>
<h2>FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS</h2>
<p class="p1"><strong>What is novel coronavirus (COVID-19)?</strong></p>
<p class="p1">COVID-19 is a newly identified coronavirus that is causing an outbreak of respiratory illness. It was first identified in December 2019 in the city of Wuhan, Hubei Province, China. Since then, the virus has been identified in multiple other countries, including cases in the U.S.</p>
<p class="p1">According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), human coronaviruses are common throughout the world and usually cause mild to moderate illness in people. This new virus is a public health concern because:</p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li2">It is newly identified, so much is still unknown about it.</li>
<li class="li2">Two other human coronaviruses, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, have caused severe illness.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p3"><strong>What is the risk?</strong></p>
<p class="p4">The CDC considers this new virus a public health concern based on current information. However, the immediate health risk to the general US public is considered low at this time. The CDC and the World Health Organization are closely monitoring the situation and providing ongoing guidance.</p>
<p class="p3">It is important to remember that Influenza A and B are more widespread and more of a concern at this time so even if the COVID-19 has not affected our area, the safety precautions for personal hygiene should be followed for Influenza.</p>
<p class="p3"><strong>Symptoms and transmission</strong></p>
<p class="p4">Symptoms may be flu-like, ranging from mild to serious, and include:</p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li2">Fever</li>
<li class="li2">Cough</li>
<li class="li2">Difficulty breathing in severe cases.</li>
<li class="li2">Symptoms <strong>do not</strong> include gastrointestinal problems</li>
</ul>
<p class="p3">Person-to-person spread is occurring, although it’s unclear exactly how it is transmitted and how easily the virus spreads between people.</p>
<p class="p3"><strong>What should I do if I think I have COVID-19 or have been exposed?</strong></p>
<p class="p4">People infected with 2019-nCoV should receive supportive care to help relieve symptoms. Currently, there is no specific antiviral treatment recommended for 2019-nCoV infection. (source: CDC). If you are showing symptoms please contact your doctor, they will offer you the best guidance. You will probably not be asked to go to the Emergency Room, except in cases of respiratory distress, in case you expose other people to this virus.</p>
<p class="p3">Students - you can call Student Life at 573-288-6334 or Campus Safety at 217-440-6394 to assist you if you are unsure what to do. We are here to help, no matter what.</p>
<p class="p3"><strong>Prevention</strong></p>
<p class="p4">There is no vaccine to prevent this virus, and the CDC advises that the best way to prevent infection is to avoid being exposed to this virus.</p>
<p class="p3">Here are everyday actions to help prevent the spread of respiratory viruses:</p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li2">Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. If soap and water are not available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer.</li>
<li class="li2">Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands.</li>
<li class="li2">Avoid close contact with people who are sick. Stay at least six feet away.</li>
<li class="li2">Stay home when you are sick.</li>
<li class="li2">Cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue, then throw the tissue in the trash.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p2">Clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces.</p>

<p><strong>Helpful information regarding COVID-19 and how to stay healthy this semester</strong></p>
<p>There is no higher priority than the health and safety of our students at Culver-Stockton College. In these unprecedented times, we hope the below information is helpful to you to stay informed about how to keep yourself healthy.</p>
<p>As always please remember these four important tips:</p>
<ol>
<li>Wash your hands like you just sliced a jalapeno pepper and you have an uncontrolled urge to touch your eyes. Twenty seconds with soap and warm water is the standard rule.</li>
<li>If you are sick with a fever and cough, please stay home. Going to work, school, or out and about when you are sick will definitely increase the risk that others will get sick. Notify your professors if you are going to miss class.</li>
<li>If you do have a fever, please contact Student Life (573-288-6334) so we can help you with the assistance that you might need.</li>
<li>Be a student of promise. Show everyone that we don’t panic and that we remain understanding of those that are sick. The large majority of people who have this virus have mild symptoms, easily treatable at home. This is especially true of younger adults, like yourselves, without other health issues.</li>
</ol>
