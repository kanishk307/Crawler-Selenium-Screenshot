                     <p>As we near the end of the 2020 spring semester, I wanted to reach out with gratitude
                        and appreciation for all that students, faculty and staff have accomplished in the
                        last few weeks. With new recommendations emerging almost daily, our ability to adapt
                        and continue our educational mission in the light of a rapidly changing world speaks
                        to our resilience and the strength of our entire campus community.
                     </p>

                     <p>I also write to share with you that as we ready ourselves to conclude this semester,
                        we are looking forward to fall 2020 with hope and anticipation. We plan to follow
                        our usual practice, which is to<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>welcome our first year students to Bluffton University during Welcome Week (beginning
                           August 28) and look forward to having all of our returning students back on campus
                           by no later than the start of the regular academic year on Monday, August 31</strong>. As we all are learning to live with the new realities that are quickly becoming
                        a part of everyday life, we also have increased knowledge of how to keep our campus
                        community functioning and safe as we move forward. We are paying close attention to
                        federal and state guidelines regarding best practices for health and safety as well
                        as partnering with our local Allen County health officials.<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Bluffton University is committed to continuing to provide our students with our stellar
                           community-based residence life experience</strong>, while they also are participating in our highly-ranked academic and athletic programs.
                     </p>
                     
                     <p>In order to be fully ready for a return to campus life that is as normal as possible,
                        Bluffton University has been busy planning for resuming campus life.<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Because we have very few classes of more than twenty students, we are confident that
                           we can provide face to face learning even if we are still required to practice social
                           distancing</strong>. We also know that if we need to “learn in place,” the past semester has shown us
                        how we can best move back and forth between remote learning and in-person learning
                        if that need arises. We are grateful to have Bluffton Hospital, which is part of the
                        Blanchard Valley Health System, as well as a walk-in clinic operated by Mercy Health
                        within walking distance of our campus. We are working with local and state officials
                        as together we determine the types of pre-testing and ongoing testing that might be
                        needed in<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>ensure the safety of all of our students</strong>.
                     </p>
                     
                     <p>We are anticipating a<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>vibrant bunch of new Beavers</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>this fall and can’t wait to see them racing their canoes during Freshman Olympics
                        at the Nature Preserve pond.&nbsp; We also can’t wait to see all of our returning students
                        back on campus and in the residence halls as we continue to prepare students for “life
                        as well as vocation.” A liberal arts education is designed to shine light into all
                        aspects of life. Bluffton University, as a faith-based University,<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>looks forward with certainty and trust in all that we know and that which we will
                           discover</strong>. We are<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>BEAVERS All</strong>!
                     </p>

                     <h4><strong>UPDATES FOR THE END OF THE ACADEMIC YEAR:</strong></h4>
                     
                     <p><strong>MOVE OUT</strong>&nbsp;<br><strong>We will hold Move Out on May 6-9</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>for students to return to campus and move out of their residence halls, return their
                        keys, rented text books, instruments, pick up mail, etc. The Student Life Office will
                        send an e-mail to all students with specific details of how and when the move out
                        process will work.
                     </p>
                     
                     <p><strong>GRADUATION</strong>&nbsp;<br>It is still our plan and our intent to hold an in-person graduation for the 2020 class.<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>We have a scenario planned for holding Commencement on Saturday, July 18, for those
                           able to attend</strong>. Once we get confirmation from the Governor on large gatherings, we will communicate
                        final details with seniors. Caps and gowns are on campus and all seniors will get
                        them in time for graduation. Please know that based on regulations, there could be
                        a ticket limit for guests per graduate. The event will be live streamed for all family
                        and friends. If we are not able to hold Commencement on Saturday, July 18, our back-up
                        date will be after Homecoming, on<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Sunday, October 11</strong>. We are looking forward to an extra-special celebration of our seniors and their
                        families.

                     <p><strong>CREDITS AND REFUNDS<br></strong>The Business Office is working to confirm the calculations from the last six weeks
                        of pro-rated room and board that will be refunded (to seniors) and credited to returning
                        students, assuming there is no outstanding balance owed.<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>All room and board credits will be posted to student accounts between May 1 and May
                           15</strong>. If you have questions or want to confirm your contact information, including direct
                        deposit is correct, please e-mail<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="mailto:cashier@bluffton.edu">cashier@bluffton.edu</a>&nbsp;

                     <p><strong><a id="cares-act"></a>STIMULUS MONEY FOR HIGHER EDUCATION<br></strong>As part of the CARES Act, Bluffton University will receive funds from the Federal
                        Government that are intended to be passed along to enrolled students who suffered
                        disruption during the COVID-19 pandemic. Each institution is given the authority to
                        determine how best to allocate these funds to its students based upon the impact to
                        its campus. As we understand that for undergraduate residential students there would
                        have been additional travel costs in coming to and from the residence halls multiple
                        times, as well as costs for setting up learning environments at home, and for traditional,
                        undergraduate face to face commuter students there also could have been additional
                        costs for setting up learning environments at home, Bluffton University is issuing
                        the following amounts directly to students:<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>All undergraduate residential students enrolled full-time as of March 18, 2020, will
                           receive $500 per student and traditional undergraduate commuters will receive $200
                           per student.<span>&nbsp;</span></strong>According to Federal guidelines, international students and DACA students are not
                        eligible for the direct stimulus money. When the university receives this money, funds
                        will be distributed as directed by the Department of Education.
                     </p>
                     
                     <p>Additionally, for students returning to campus next academic year, there will be some
                        additional emergency relief aid available for students who have increased financial
                        need because of the impact that COVID-19 has had on their personal or family’s financial
                        situation. We are working to confirm a process for how to apply for this aid; please
                        be watching for more details.&nbsp;

                     <p>Dear Bluffton Campus Community,</p>
                     
                     <p>As I write this from my desk looking out over the College Hall lawn, my heart goes
                        out to each and every one of you with deep gratitude for continuing to live out the
                        mission of Bluffton University during these turbulent times.
                     </p>
                     
                     <p><strong>Bluffton University remains open and operational, while observing the guidelines for
                           virtual working and learning environments as we begin a new order from Governor DeWine
                           to “stay at home”.</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>Gandhi tells us that “[a] small body of determined spirits fired by an unquenchable
                        faith in their mission can alter the course of history” and this campus community
                        is continuing our mission even as we stay at home and save lives.
                     </p>
                     
                     <p>From students and faculty who are together navigating remote learning, including our
                        IT and library staff members who have worked diligently to make sure that everyone
                        can access platforms and resources, and others like the LRC who continues to tutor
                        students regularly, and so many more, we are demonstrating an unquenchable faith in
                        Bluffton University.<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Thank you all for your patience, your grace and your caring for and about one another.</strong></p>
                     
                     <p>As much as all of us would like to come back physically to campus yet this spring,
                        in light of the Governor’s new order to “stay at home” and the increasing number of
                        coronavirus cases nationally and the climbing number in Ohio, and our desire to keep
                        the Bluffton Village community safe as well as abiding by guidelines to protect our
                        most vulnerable citizens, it does not seem possible at this time. As we work together
                        to “flatten the curve” of the coronavirus:

                        <li><strong>Bluffton University will remain open and operational</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>to support our students who are learning remotely as well as the few students who
                           remain on campus. Almost all of our faculty and staff are working from home, but there
                           are a few essential employees who will be on campus practicing social distancing and
                           the other guidelines recommended by the CDC and Governor DeWine’s office and in accordance
                           with the “stay at home” order.

                     <p>Bluffton University will take the following actions to reflect the shortened period
                        most students will use University housing and meal plans during the spring 2020 semester:
                     </p>
                     
                     <ul>
                        
                        <li>Prorated housing credits will be placed on student accounts for the period of time
                           students are unable to return to their campus housing. These credits will roll over
                           to the next academic year for returning students. If the student will not be living
                           in University housing during fall 2020, the credit will be applied to tuition charges
                           for the next academic year.
                        </li>

                        <li>Balances of both General Meal Plans and Beaver Bucks will roll over to the next academic
                           year. The University is waiving all current limitations on the amount that may be
                           rolled over.
                        </li>
                        
                        <li>Those students who were granted approval to remain on campus during this time and
                           continue to live in University housing will not be eligible for the credit and/or
                           roll over.

                        <li>Seniors graduating in May will receive a prorated housing and meal plan credit on
                           their student account. The credits will first apply to any outstanding balance owed
                           to the University. If the account balance is paid in full at graduation, the University
                           will issue a refund to the student in the weeks following.
                        </li>
                        
                        <li>There will be no financial credit provided for tuition since faculty instruction continues
                           on a remote basis.
                        </li>
                        
                        <li>The housing credit and meal plan rollover is null and void if the student does not
                           return in fall 2020; this excludes graduating seniors.
                        </li>
                        
                     </ul>
                     
                     <ul>
                        
                        <li>As explained above, all financial credits will be applied in the June 2020 billing
                           cycle.
                        </li>

                     <p>Should the State or Federal Government make any new decisions regarding reimbursement

                        together; it is the first time in the history of the University that we have attempted
                        this type of financial adjusting on such a large scale.

                     <p>Last Thursday evening, Dr. Paul Neufeld Weaver, director of global education, met
                        with students registered to participate in May cross-cultural experiences to update
                        them on our evolving plans.&nbsp; At this point, we are planning that the experiences in
                        Germany, Arizona and Kentucky will be moved to later in the summer. The Greece experience
                        is being cancelled. The August Guatemala experience is still scheduled as planned.&nbsp;
                        Students will be working with Paul and Elaine Suderman to determine how the adjusted
                        dates work for them or to make alternative plans. Any questions should be directed
                        to Paul Neufeld Weaver.

                        and Saturday, May 2. The alumni office plans to explore possibilities for some Virtual

                     <p>Based on the increasing recommendations by Governor DeWine and today’s recommendation
                        by The President of the United States to reduce group gatherings to 10 people or less,
                        Bluffton University is taking the following actions:
                     </p>
                     
                     <ul>
                        
                        <li><strong>All classes will continue to be held via online/remote learning methods through April
                              12. We are suspending all other athletic-related activities, including practice and
                              intra-squad games of traditional and non-traditional teams, until further notice.</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>We will continue to evaluate whether it will be possible for everyone to return to
                           campus following Easter break to finish out the semester, including a modified plan
                           for Commencement.

                        <li><strong>The university requests that all students return to their primary residence.</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>We are closing our traditional residence halls, with move-out to be complete by no
                           later than 5 p.m. Wednesday, March 18. You do not have to take everything home at
                           this time, but you can if you choose to do so. Once you leave campus, you may not
                           return until residence halls reopen. &nbsp;
                        </li>

                     <p>We understand that for some students the university is their primary home. We will
                        work with students who have extenuating circumstances to provide continuity of housing
                        and services. If you believe you must stay on campus, please contact Tyson Goings,
                        director of residence life.

                        <li>While the university will continue its business operations,<strong><span>&nbsp;</span>more university faculty and staff will begin to work remotely from home as roles and
                              timing permit.</strong>&nbsp;More information will come from your vice president this evening. Understanding this
                           affects student workers as well, student employment will end today as of 5 p.m., unless
                           you are contacted by your supervisor at a later date. Some students may be able to
                           work remotely.

                        <li>As of Wednesday at 5 p.m., the majority of buildings on campus will limit public access
                           and visitors.

                     <p>While I know that this is disappointing news for all of us, we want to comply with
                        the State and Federal recommendations to keep students, faculty, staff, and community
                        safe.

                     <p>As I mentioned in my note to you yesterday afternoon, Governor DeWine held a press
                        conference where he strongly recommended that all higher education institutions in
                        Ohio move to remote learning for classes as soon as possible for a period of time.
                        The full list of recommendations can be found at <a href="https://coronavirus.ohio.gov/wps/portal/gov/covid-19/" target="_blank">Coronavirus.ohio.gov</a>. In addition, he asked that all large events, such as indoor sports and other performance
                        events, be canceled.
                     </p>
                     
                     <p>Bluffton University, in alignment with Governor DeWine’s recommendations, has established
                        the following plan to protect its students, employees, visitors and the Bluffton community.
                     </p>
                     
                     <p><strong>As a residential campus, Bluffton University recognizes that some students do not
                           have the ability to return home and therefore the university will remain open, including
                           student support services, the Learning Resource Center, academic resources, residence
                           and dining facilities, athletic and recreation facilities. Beginning today, the university
                           is implementing a plan for remote learning options.</strong></p>
                     
                     <p>The following measures will be implemented immediately and will extend through Easter
                        Break (Monday, April 13). We will continue to evaluate new information as it develops
                        and share updates as they become available.

                           to remote learning. <strong>However, we urge students to make choices that are best for their own personal health
                              situations. Students are responsible for notifying professors if a student decides
                              it is not in their best interest to be in class on Thursday.</strong> Students are responsible for making up the work that they miss.&nbsp;

                     <p><strong>Zoom on-line learning platform:</strong> Professors may decide to host live-streamed video class meetings using our Zoom platform.
                        While there are many ways to connect to a Zoom meeting, the most reliable way is via
                        Zoom’s software, available for all major computer and mobile platforms, as well as&nbsp;browser
                        plug-ins for Chrome and Firefox. We’d recommend that you install the software while
                        you are still on campus using <span><a title="Zoom" href="https://zoom.us/download" target="_blank">this link</a></span>. While we expect the installation to be smooth and simple, installing while on campus
                        means we can help you should you run into challenges. If you have any questions, feel
                        free to stop by the Tech Center or e-mail Chris Gott at <span><a href="mailto:gottc@bluffton.edu?subject=Zoom">gottc@bluffton.edu</a></span></p>
                     
                     <p><strong>Class schedule:</strong> During this transitional time of remote learning, the intent is to preserve the current
                        structure of class times. For example, if your class usually met from 9-9:50 a.m.
                        MWF, you need to plan to attend class on-line at that time unless told differently
                        by your professor. You should not schedule work or other activities during the times
                        when you normally have class. If you have questions contact Dr. Lamar Nisly, vice
                        president and dean and academic affairs.

                     <p>As we continue to serve our students, we do need all employees to be present to continue
                        campus services. However, this afternoon Governor Mike DeWine announced that all K-12
                        schools will be closed for three weeks starting no later than end of the day on Monday;
                        some districts will close earlier. We understand that some employees will have a demonstrated
                        need for flexibility. Those employees should talk with their vice president to create
                        a work flow plan as indicated in President Wood’s message on March 11. During this
                        mandated three week period with K-12, the university is flexing current policies to
                        allow for alternative work hours and the use of sick, vacation or personal hours.
                        All impacted employees will need to develop a written work plan with their vice president.
                     </p>

                        <li>The university is open during this time period. Staff are expected to report to campus
                           for work. Sick time should continue to be used per the Employee Handbook.&nbsp;
                        </li>
                        
                        <li>Bluffton will provide work-at-home flexibility to employees who are at high-risk (i.e.
                           chronically ill or immuno-compromised prior to this outbreak, or have a need to work
                           remotely due to personal matters related to the COVID-19). Employees should talk with
                           their vice president to establish a work plan.
                        </li>
                        
                        <li>Vice presidents will communicate with each division for additional work-flow plans
                           by Friday, March 13.

                           gatherings (any group of 20 or more) and public events until April 13; this includes
                           student organization events and use of university facilities by off-campus groups
                           (for example, conference rentals).&nbsp;

                           20 or more participants, or these groups should meet in a virtual capacity when possible,
                           including student organizations.

                           Indoor team practice will not be permitted, including non-traditional (off-season)
                           practices that happen indoors. Small group/individual practices may continue indoors
                           under the supervision and guidance of coaches and in direct consultation with the
                           athletic director. We remain in communication with the Commissioner of the Heartland
                           Conference who is continuing to monitor the situation across the NCAA and we will
