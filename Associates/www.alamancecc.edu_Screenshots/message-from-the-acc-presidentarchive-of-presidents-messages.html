<p>Dear College Community,</p>
<p>We are about six weeks away from our Aug. 17 start to the fall semester – a mix of online and classroom instruction. I want to assure you that College leadership is doing everything possible to put in place protocols and precautions to safeguard everyone’s health and safety on campus.</p>
<p>Our return-to-campus committee is examining several new initiatives, one of which includes temperature checks on campus. This is still being explored as to how and where we might conduct these to ensure privacy.</p>
<p>Sanitation stations stocked with hand sanitizer, masks, and gloves are available at multiple locations throughout the Main Campus and at the Dillingham Center.</p>
<p>The College has extended its CARES ACT grant application deadline for one more week. This is for students whose academic progress has been impacted by the COVID-19 virus. You can find eligibility guidelines on the College web site at&nbsp;<a href="https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.alamancecc.edu%2Fhealth-alert%2Fheerf%2F%3Ffbclid%3DIwAR2SRmDtJ48fGeUixCuYhKoi_FPjFyfAzbr_zL51YhX5b8EN_YPH2VmzJjI&amp;h=AT0ie-uC6sg1-wzBanSfUQu0hVBNVZAXHnTmWvqAB0uTYVOHEuyMhBYoGbzdh0iJxiHxU7FlYiwsodLipXF6YO3s7VEbu2fvHze5RGNvKX_QRDW8i1ysm5MwCR8ziZwbhe15j7nxFqfBwSjFsMQGUNKZKU9t3EMCZStW82XRrrvBAVV5zpAh_UfCUEpfTLmADHJgjyCmNhpSy2jb9a0mqrTfitY6vSwBh3d_zD2FpGgkd6WdIPOMRFwHL_VYFzvj-rn3zMpKgCHLb_6lb73WH_NkkAR-tB0L9LQDe0DbS3WE4UyUa-g6yvo83d3WQK8WMslI-YObjQc9K48xCM0plWa4el1xfaAQa9NAlQ7JDKkAFaN-B8G-mJzt7rIPGBIguCCEIyCwGzjEZoUD9paPLkCnJlGCWmxuvjmFnEO8OX0MV1UBWirvlJDun1emeze-3yZ35Nge8ITqD0_r6Sx85mFhAGUBI5tXkl_WNG8apzxOg6_HMpEzgHMht-RFCRwUzx76xRzZhkj6cI6xOUrXIhQWy6gdMfj9ZbPoRIMTekmh9JQ-7eBnh1EGZrAxyupFAr_ryL53qr330-w5uMDGOwccO1ErxELCLscJXzfbVsqtMlreCxLlmMPok83C9pxHbv5wFAY" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" data-ft="{&quot;tn&quot;:&quot;-U&quot;}" data-lynx-mode="async">https://www.alamancecc.edu/health-alert/heerf/</a></p>
<p>The return-to-campus committee is also in the process of crafting a short questionnaire that students and employees can ask and answer for themselves about recent travel, possible exposures, and any symptoms they may be showing. Based on their answers, if necessary, additional guidance from the College would be forthcoming.</p>
<p>We are also exploring an on-campus testing site administered by the county health department during the first week of fall semester. This would allow the opportunity for students, staff, and faculty to be tested if they choose. Again, this is in the review process.</p>
<p>That same committee is reviewing feedback from a recent faculty survey that will help to guide our decisions and actions in the weeks and months ahead. Another survey is under review, one that might explore mental health issues that may be impacting some families within our college community.</p>
<p>In the meantime, I remind everyone that the services of the Employee Assistance Counseling Program with Cone Health at Alamance Regional Medical Center can be scheduled through our Human Resources Office. The EAC Program helps individuals deal with a myriad of stressful situations in life, and is strictly confidential.</p>
<p>I’m delighted to announce that the College has hired a Health Educator who starts next week and who can provide our campus community with additional guidance in the months ahead.</p>
<p>Public Safety has posted signage on campus, reminding everyone that masks – pursuant to the Governor’s recent order – will be required when on campus. The College will continue to employ strategies to educate employees, students, vendors, and other guests on the importance of this safety precaution. In cases of non-compliance, the College will take appropriate measures to ensure the safety of the campus community.</p>
<p>As a reminder, the Governor extended his Phase 2 restrictions until at least July 20. That order reminds citizens to maintain social distancing and to wash hands frequently, and it also recommends continuing working remotely when feasible.</p>
<p>The College’s plan to gradually bring more employees back to campus beginning on July 6 is being done with consideration to the Governor’s extension of Phase 2. In functional areas where an on-campus presence is essential to the operation of the College and/or to supporting students, vice presidents have the authority to gradually return additional staff to work beginning Monday, July 6, provided at a minimum social distancing can be observed and/or face coverings worn. In functional areas where some combination of teleworking is being employed successfully, vice presidents have the autonomy to delay the July 6 date (and to adjust their individual phased approaches) as they deem appropriate.</p>
<p>As always, we continue to receive and follow guidance from the Alamance County Health Department, the Centers for Disease Control, the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services, the Governor’s Office, and the North Carolina Community College System.</p>
<p>I remind all students and employees to remain at home if they are feeling ill and/or experiencing any COVID-19 symptoms (e.g. fever, cough, shortness of breath).</p>
<p>Let me return to something I think is vitally important. The idea of wearing a mask I know is foreign to many, uncomfortable for some. The health experts remind us repeatedly that wearing a mask is about protecting others around you. Yes, it offers you some personal protection, but it offers even more protection for others in the event you have been exposed to the virus but are not showing any symptoms.</p>
<p>An ACC employee mentioned to me just the other day that she has two elderly parents she cares for at home and how the elderly population is most at risk for infection. She asked me what the College can do to mitigate the infection’s spread by spreading the word about wearing masks.</p>
<p>So let me make this personal: I wear a mask. I wear a mask to protect myself, sure, but I wear it more to protect others. It shows respect for others. I think it’s a very loud reminder of the Golden Rule.</p>
<p>Bottom line: a mask says I got your back, please have mine.</p>
<p>As of noon today, North Carolina was reporting 68,142 cases of COVID-19. Alamance County was reporting 1,179 cases.</p>
<p>Those numbers are a sobering reminder this July 4 weekend: Exercise common sense, exercise precautions, exercise your care for yourself, for your family, for your friends, and for everyone around you.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>

<p><em>June 18, 2020</em></p>
<p>Dear College Community:</p>
<p>As we approach Week 6 with a gradual re-introduction of classes to our campuses, I want to put emphasis on the word <em>gradual.</em></p>
<p>In all that we do going forward in this new environment, our goal is to ensure the health and safety of our students, our faculty, and our staff. So we will continue to be deliberate, intentional, and circumspect. Gradual will define our approach.</p>
<p>The College has set a tentative return-to-campus for more of our staff beginning July 6. That return will be gradual and it will be staggered. Our goal in the first few weeks is to only have roughly 50 percent of our staff working on campus at a given time. We will look at job function and we will rely on managers to recommend staggered on-campus work shifts that make sense and keep the College operating to serve our students.</p>
<p>Our draft plan continues to develop. That plan is informed by guidelines and recommendations from the CDC, the North Carolina Community College System office, the Alamance County Health Department, and other emergency response agencies. We hope to introduce more specifics of that plan soon, but please know that things are changing day to day, week to week. Any plan is something of a moving target.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a lead-up to our August 17 start of fall semester, we will continue to monitor our campus to help ensure that social distancing is maintained.</p>
<p>The College will consider legal guidance as to mask-wearing by staff and faculty. To what extent can that be made possible? Under what circumstances may that be relaxed? Will this be recommended or required?</p>
<p>Let me return to social distancing: We know what our room capacities are. We will post signage outside each classroom so everyone is on the same page and there is no confusion.</p>
<p>We continue aggressive cleaning of frequently-touched surfaces. More of our employees are participating in cleaning training seminars and are learning about the efficacy of using hospital-grade cleaning items.</p>
<p>We are issuing gloves and masks, and we are expanding hand sanitizing stations across our campuses.</p>
<p>As of noon today, there were 48,188 confirmed COVID-19 cases in North Carolina, 838 in Alamance County.</p>
<p>In today’s COVID-19 briefing – Day 101 of the state’s response to the virus – Governor Roy Cooper said his office was looking into the possibility of requiring masks statewide. He stressed that this was a “low cost, low tech way” to protect ourselves and the lives of others.</p>
<p>In short, a mask – along with social distancing and frequent hand-washing – is how we effectively beat back this pandemic. I encourage everyone – our students, staff, and faculty – to heed these protocols.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Dr. Algie C. Gatewood<br />
Alamance Community College President</p>

<p>&nbsp;<em>June 12, 2020</em></p>
<p>Dear College Community,</p>
<p>Our fourth week of summer instruction has gone well and we are excited to introduce in weeks five and six some additional programming including Medical Laboratory Technology, Nurse Aide, and General Education Hybrid in Curriculum and small engine repair, notary public, defensive driving, conversational Spanish, and EMT/Paramedic in Continuing Education.</p>
<p>Faculty who are teaching this summer have provided us very positive feedback regarding our health and safety protocols and their experience when on campus.</p>
<p>I remind our staff, faculty, and students that we continue an aggressive cleaning regimen for frequently-touched surfaces. We are using hospital-grade cleaning supplies on such surfaces. We are training our employees how to use these cleaning supplies in their personal spaces. Fifteen employees have taken this training so far, and the training remains available to any one interested.</p>
<p>We are providing employees masks and gloves. In specific areas, we are also providing lab coats and gowns. We are limiting seating capacity in our classrooms for the summer term.</p>
<p>We are strongly encouraging our staff and faculty now on campus to model health and safety protocols by wearing a mask when in close proximity (6 feet) to others. Remember, wearing a mask says you care about the safety of others. This protocol will be a basic expectation for fall semester.</p>
<p>On the topic of health and safety, I have several additional items to share:</p>
<p>&#8211; This summer session, we are still limiting access throughout the campus and utilizing a common entrance where security staff can answer questions, issue PPE, and provide guidance.</p>
<p>&#8211; The College finalized a “Covid Cap” plan to reduce student capacity in all classrooms for the fall semester. That information will go out to faculty this week.</p>
<p>&#8211; The College is reviewing and re-imagining what fall semester offerings will look like – online, hybrid, face-to-face – across all sections and programs. Again, we will offer instruction online where it makes the most sense.</p>
<p>&#8211; The College is reviewing and responding to feedback from faculty and staff on campus this summer.</p>
<p>&#8211; The College will, for the second time, survey faculty. That feedback will be useful in guiding our decisions as we approach the beginning of fall semester on August 17.</p>
<p>&#8211; The College, in its attempt to return to a more normal operation, is reviewing a staggered and phased in approach for bringing more staff back to campus. We are evaluating models that include alternating work days during the week or alternating mornings and afternoons. No final decisions have been made yet as to how the College will stage this, but the health and safety of people will remain at the core of our considerations.</p>
<p>The Governor’s Safer at Home Phase 2 protocols are in place until June 26. In the coming days we should know more about what the next phase will look like and what restrictions will be loosened or left in place. In the meantime, I encourage you to follow Phase 2 protocols.</p>
<p>As of noon on Thursday, June 11, there were 39,481 Covid-19 cases in North Carolina, 581 of them in Alamance County. Those numbers will continue to rise, but they will rise more slowly if everyone does their part to keep themselves and others safe by observing basic health protocols.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Sincerely,</p>
<p>Dr. Algie C. Gatewood<br />
Alamance Community College President</p>

<p><em>June 4, 2020</em></p>
<p>Dear College Community,</p>
<p>Our continued phased re-introduction of students to campus this third week has gone well. Next week, we will add a host of licensure, certification, and testing services in our classrooms.</p>
<p>Our Deans and Department Heads are reconfiguring the fall schedule based on limited classroom capacities meant to ensure social distancing and everyone’s health and safety. Fall semester, which begins on August 17, will look a little different to our students and faculty. By next week, we hope to provide more detail about our online, hybrid, and face-to-face offerings, program by program, section by section.</p>
<p>The College continues to monitor and follow safety guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and the North Carolina Community College System, as well as our local health department. The College is providing masks, gloves, and disinfectant to those on campus. The College is continuing an aggressive cleaning/sanitizing regimen of frequently-touched surfaces. The College has installed clear plastic barriers in high interaction service areas.</p>
<p>The College is advertising a new part-time position this week: Health Educator. This individual will be responsible for researching, developing, and maintaining health promotion materials; planning, conducting, and evaluating health-related programs, events, workshops, and trainings; and advising individual students, faculty, and staff on COVID-19 related matters. This position will work with the Student Success Center, Disability Services, and the Public Safety department.</p>
<p>In all that we do, the safety of our employees, students, and visitors is paramount.</p>
<p>This Friday, June 5, we are excited to welcome back to campus our graduates who are picking up caps &amp; gowns, collecting yard signs, and getting their picture taken in their graduation regalia. I remind our students that a professional photographer/videographer will be on hand to mark this milestone. The photographs and video gathered on this day will go a long way in delivering a virtual commencement, which is tentatively scheduled for June 26. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can learn more about Friday’s activities on our web site at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.alamancecc.edu/commencement/curriculum-commencement-faq/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">alamancecc.edu/commencement</a>.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, a <a href="https://spectrumlocalnews.com/nc/triangle-sandhills/news/2020/06/02/north-carolina-community-colleges-see-massive-increase-in-enrollment#" target="_blank" rel="noopener">television news crew was on campus</a> to report that the College’s enrollment for 2019-20 was up about 7 percent. We were among a minority of community colleges in North Carolina to experience that level of growth. That’s great news.</p>
<p>Even better news is this: Our summer enrollment is up about 13.8 percent. Students are excited about furthering their academic journey and we are excited about making that happen.</p>
<p>Our ad-hoc return-to-campus committee has tentatively proposed July 6 as the date when larger numbers of staff can return to work on campus. I want to emphasize that this date is tentative and that this return will likely be a gradual, phased-in process. No final decisions have been made. Planning continues on this front. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 continue to rise in North Carolina, but the number of tests is increasing as well. Today, the number of cases topped 31,000 in our state, with more than 400 of them in Alamance County.</p>
<p>I hope these numbers convince you to heed the Governor’s latest “safer at home” guidelines, which continue to include social distancing, wearing a face mask when around others, and practicing frequent hand washing. These protocols will be a basic expectation of our students, staff, and faculty on our campuses.</p>
<p>While many of us are apart, we are all in this together. Stay safe.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Dr. Algie C. Gatewood<br />
Alamance Community College President</p>

<p><em>May 29, 2020</em></p>
<p>Dear College Community,</p>
<p>Our gradual introduction of students to campus this second week has gone well, setting the stage for additional programming in the coming weeks.</p>
<p>Next week, we will add curriculum programs, such as Biotechnology, Cosmetology, and Machining. Continuing Education instruction will include carpentry, plumbing, HVAC, pharmacy technician, paramedic, and notary public to name a few. Student support services will open tutoring (by appointment) and placement testing.</p>
<p>The following week, we plan to introduce some General Education curriculum hybrid courses. In addition, Continuing Education will offer a series of automotive classes, along with EMT refresher and GED testing. All of this is driven by the need for hands-on, face-to-face instruction in these areas this summer – all in accordance with CDC guidelines and safety protocols. We will continue to evaluate our progress, and to offer new courses in the coming weeks as appropriate.</p>
<p>Many of you have asked about the College’s plans for the fall semester. At this time, we do not anticipate changing our fall calendar. The fall schedule will begin on August 17 for Curriculum.</p>
<p>You may have read about earlier starts and stops at four-year universities by eliminating fall break and wrapping up instruction by Thanksgiving.</p>
<p>Our approach is informed by this simple fact: Community colleges substantially differ from four-year institutions that draw students from across the nation and the world. Our College community is local and largely self-contained, minimizing health risks from students traveling long distances and risking a viral spread.</p>
<p>You will, however, notice some changes this fall. We will employ social distancing protocols that will necessitate strategic class sizes. We will look at staggering class times. We will add more sections of our classes. We will offer those classes later in the day and on Fridays and Saturdays – traditionally when our student population has been lightest.</p>
<p>And in all of this, we will focus on online or hybrid classroom-online instruction to the greatest extent possible, with our goal being to reduce the number of students in classrooms and labs at any one time, but yet meet demand.</p>
<p>In all that we do, we are keeping the health and safety of our students, faculty, and staff at the forefront.</p>
<p>I have several other items of interest to students, staff, and faculty.</p>
<p>&#8211; Thus far, the College has dispersed $200,000 to 193 students who qualified for emergency relief under the federal CARES Act. These funds are for students who have been impacted by COVID-19’s disruption of college operations. Students can still apply for this emergency relief through June 30. We believe many more students qualify for this assistance but have not yet applied. <a href="https://www.alamancecc.edu/health-alert/heerf/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Learn more about eligibility guidelines and application procedures on our web site.</a></p>
<p>&#8211; We are discussing both how and when to bring more of our staff back to campus. No date has been set yet. We will make decisions in accordance with CDC guidelines and N.C. Community College System guidelines. Additionally, we are looking at where it makes the most sense to telework and to what extent.</p>
<p>&#8211; Discussions are ongoing about bringing more faculty back to campus. Obviously, much of that is driven by the mode of instruction most appropriate to each class and program.</p>
<p>&#8211; Next month, we will ask our Board of Trustees to consider an update to our Emergency Leave Policy. More details will be provided in a few weeks.</p>
<p>&#8211; This week, we were excited to hold our Basic Law Enforcement Training graduation ceremony outdoors. Celebrating their success was important.</p>
<p>&#8211; Many of you have asked about the College’s plans for graduation and Commencement. Unfortunately, despite our best efforts, we have been unable to secure a large enough venue to hold a traditional ceremony this summer. So instead, we are planning a virtual Commencement ceremony. I assure you that each student’s success will be recognized. You can help us gather photos and video footage when you come pick up your caps and gowns on June 5. We will have a professional photographer/videographer there to capture your special moments. Our preliminary plan is to hold this virtual ceremony in late June. More information on this will be coming soon.</p>
<p>As of Thursday morning, there were 25,412 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in North Carolina, more than 300 of them in Alamance County. These numbers inform the need to maintain social distancing, to wear a face mask when around others, and to practice frequent hand washing. Practicing these protocols will be a basic expectation of our students, staff and faculty on our campuses.</p>
<p>Stay steadfast to the safety of you and others.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Dr. Algie C. Gatewood<br />
Alamance Community College President</p>

<p><em>May 21, 2020</em></p>
<p>Dear College Community,</p>
<p>I am pleased to report that our first week of face-to-face instruction in select public health programs – nursing, nurse aid, EMS to name a few – was successful and that our faculty and students observed proper protocols to ensure everyone’s safety in the Powell Building and B-Building.</p>
<p>Based on that success, we will bring our Dental Assisting students back on campus next week – the first return of students to the Main Building. In addition, we will offer classroom instruction for licensure and certification programs in the Advance Applied Technology Center.</p>
<p>Next week, the ad hoc return-to-campus planning committee is expected to provide recommendations as to what weeks three and four will look like at our College. Our focus during those weeks will very likely involve more Continuing Education/Workforce Development instruction.</p>
<p>That same planning committee has begun discussions about fall semester instructional delivery and timelines. We are studying a variety of models that other 2-year and 4-year higher education institutions are rolling out for reference. These discussions are focused on how much online delivery is feasible and the logistics of physical distancing in our classrooms.</p>
<p>I expect our plans for fall will begin crystallizing soon, after which I will share those plans.</p>
<p>I know many of you have asked about Commencement. We are still trying to get a commitment to a venue and calendar date, but we are also considering a number of other possibilities. Please be patient and know that the College will find a way to celebrate the success of our graduates.</p>
<p>In all that we are doing, you should know that our decisions and actions align with the recently released CDC guidelines for higher education. Additionally, our intentional and incremental return to campus tracks Governor Cooper’s measured phase-in plan. Further, we are continuing to work very closely regarding our plans with the Alamance County Health Department.</p>
<p>Everyone’s health and safety is a priority in guiding our decisions and actions.</p>
<p>Let me touch on a few reminders and housekeeping matters:</p>
<p>&#8211; Campus access is still limited.<br />
&#8211; The College continues its stepped up cleaning protocols.<br />
&#8211; The College has secured face masks, gloves, and disinfectants for staff, faculty, and students.<br />
&#8211; The College is modifying seating in classrooms to ensure social distancing.<br />
&#8211; The College is securing additional plexi-glass shields for high-interaction and close-transactional services.<br />
&#8211; Higher education relief funds for eligible students under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security (CARES) Act are still available. You can learn more about the brief application and qualifying process on the College’s website.<br />
&#8211; We have expanded Wi-Fi in our parking lots.</p>
<p>As of today, May 21, the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services is reporting 20,860 cases of COVID-19 in the state. The Alamance County Health Department reports 260 cases in Alamance County.</p>
<p>Governor Cooper announced yesterday that the state is moving into Phase 2 of eased restrictions, effective 5 pm on Friday, May 22. He continues to take a cautious approach. If the data and trends are favorable, the state may move into Phase 3 by late June.</p>
<p>In the meantime, the College will stay the course. We will continue to encourage telework where appropriate and feasible.</p>
<p>For those at home and inclined to venture forth, exercise care. I emphasize what the governor has emphasized: Wearing a mask in public is a sign of compassion for others around you. Wearing a mask says you care for friends, family, and strangers. Wearing a mask says you want to protect them in the event you are unknowingly infected and asymptomatic.</p>
<p>As a child, I remember in the movies that the cowboys wearing the masks were never the good guys. But times have changed. The new normal says your mask makes you one of the good guys.</p>
<p>Look out for yourself and for each other.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Dr. Algie C. Gatewood<br />

<p><em>May 14, 2020</em></p>
<p>Dear College Community,</p>
<p>Summer semester 2020 begins Monday, May 18, and more students will be returning to campus after a two-month hiatus for face-to-face instruction.&nbsp; These will be various health care- and science-related program students occupying the Powell Building and EMT students occupying first floor B-Building.</p>
<p>We have put safety protocols in place for these students and instructors and we will closely monitor the first week before any additional program re-openings get underway.</p>
<p>Our proposed plan is to next introduce face-to-face instruction on May 26 for Dental Assisting students in the Main Building and Continuing Education safety inspections classes in the Advanced Applied Technology Center.</p>
<p>I want to assure everyone that the health and safety of our students and employees is paramount. An ad hoc planning committee has been working diligently with our county health department and our Public Safety Department to address precautions and procedures that safeguard our College community.</p>
<p>Re-introducing classroom instruction is being done in a gradual and measured manner. If issues arise &#8211; or if state or national guidance changes &#8211; during any part of this phasing-in process, we will step back and reassess.&nbsp; Everyone&#8217;s health and safety is at the forefront of our strategy to keep academic progress moving forward.</p>
<p>The planning committee has issued a detailed guidance document to faculty, which is being regularly reviewed and revised as needed.&nbsp; Student Services has issued a detailed guidance document for students needing to access various services on campus.&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="https://www.alamancecc.edu/health-alert/2020-summer-campus-safety-guidance/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">You can find that information here.</a></p>
<p>I have instructed College leadership that safety is the watchword for every action and decision.&nbsp; I want to thank them profusely for their continuing hard work.</p>
<p>We completed spring semester earlier this month.&nbsp; We did so under difficult circumstances.&nbsp; We did so during a historic period in our state, our nation, and our world.</p>
<p>To our faculty, staff, and students who took online instruction and learning to unprecedented levels, I express my deepest gratitude for your hard work &#8211; and for your continuing hard work as we educate and train this summer semester and the upcoming fall semester in August.</p>
<p>I want to commend our May graduates for their perseverance.&nbsp; Discussion continues as to how and when our College can mark this important milestone and celebrate their success.</p>
<p>To our entire College community, I remind you that many of our newly-minted graduates have begun taking their place on the front lines to battle this pandemic &#8211; graduates in Nursing, Medical Assisting, Medical Laboratory Technicians, EMS, and Basic Law Enforcement Training just to name a few.&nbsp; We all owe them a debt of gratitude.&nbsp; Please keep them in your thoughts and prayers.</p>
<p>As of 11 a.m. on Thursday, May 14, North Carolina was reporting 16,507 cases of the viral infection.&nbsp; Alamance County is approaching 200 confirmed cases.</p>
<p>As our community continues to observe the stay-at-home executive order, I ask each of you to observe social distancing protocols, to wear masks when in public, to limit travel, to practice heightened hygiene at home, and to look out for one another.</p>
<p>Stay strong as we navigate these times together.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Dr. Algie C. Gatewood<br />

<div>
<p><em>May 8, 2020</em></p>
<p>Dear College Community,</p>
</div>
<div>I want to share with students, faculty, and staff some important updates and reminders this week, beginning with a plan to gradually re-introduce limited face-to-face instruction on campus.&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Starting May 18, we will have approximately 200 Nursing and EMT students in classrooms on the Main campus. This instruction will be staggered and there will be a limited number of students in each class.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>We are evaluating how those students will move through their respective spaces, how we may provide personal protective equipment (PPE) and sanitizing protocols, how we will train our employees AND students in PPE use, and how we can leverage continued online instruction where appropriate.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>We will be monitoring that first week carefully for safety and health issues.&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>The following week, we will be joined by Dental Assisting students and those requiring licensure or certification training under Continuing Education.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Again, this will be a gradual process, phased-in and monitored closely. Before we implement the first phase of our plan, the Alamance County Health Department will be asked to review it and provide feedback.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Let me remind everyone that in these early weeks, the library and tutoring labs will remain closed. <a href="https://www.alamancecc.edu/student-success-center-site/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Student success services</a> will continue online and over the phone. In rare instances, a limited number of students can avail themselves of those services by appointment only.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>To our students, I remind you that beginning next Monday, ACC is taking applications for you to apply for an emergency grant through the <a href="https://www.alamancecc.edu/health-alert/heerf/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Higher Education Emergency Relief Fund (HEERF)</a>, which comes under the CARES Act grant program. This grant program is meant to assist students with expenses related to disruptions of campus operations due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Students can find information about this program on our <a href="https://www.alamancecc.edu/health-alert/heerf/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">website</a>. Then next week, you can fill out an application through the <a href="https://selfservice.alamancecc.edu:8173/Student" target="_blank" rel="noopener">self-service</a> E-forms.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I strongly encourage our students to review that grant application process and assess eligibility for funding.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>To current and prospective students, we are <a href="https://www.alamancecc.edu/admissions/summer-school/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">registering for summer</a> and fall semesters now. Please don’t wait because summer classes begin May 18. <a href="https://www.alamancecc.edu/admissions-site/home/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Visit us online</a> or call our student services office now.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>To our employees, I remind you that information is available on our website regarding <a href="https://www.alamancecc.edu/health-alert/fmla-leave-policies-what-you-should-know/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">temporary leave</a> and <a href="https://www.alamancecc.edu/health-alert/temporary-emergency-leave-policy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">emergency leave</a> policies.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>To everyone, I remind you that Governor Roy Cooper is transitioning North Carolina into Phase 1 of eased restrictions effective 5 p.m. today, May 8.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Nonetheless, his stay-at-home order remains in effect.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Essential businesses – and that includes community colleges – remain open. Furthermore, essential educational programs are allowed face-to-face instruction. These include Nursing, Nurse Aid, Medical Assistant, EMS and Basic Law Enforcement.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>As of today, North Carolina has 13,868 cases of the virus, 149 of them in Alamance County.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>The governor’s office this week introduced a new mantra: Wear. Wait. Wash.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>In this new normal, that means wearing a face mask when out in public, remaining 6 feet away from others, and washing hands regularly.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Stay resolute. Stay the course. And stay safe.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Sincerely,</div>
<div>
Dr. Algie C. Gatewood<br />
Alamance Community College President</div>

<p><em>May 1, 2020</em></p>
<p>Dear College Community,</p>
<p>As we near the start of the summer semester later this month, I want to share some important news and updates.</p>
<p>College leadership is in ongoing discussions about how and when we may begin easing access restrictions on our campuses. As you know, we chose to continue online instruction through the end of spring semester, May 8.</p>
<p>We hope to announce next week the first phase of returning to more face-to-face instruction for some programs deemed critical and that are exempt from stay-at-home orders. Programs such as Nurse Aid and Medical Assisting will join Nursing, EMS, and BLET in offering some classes in the face-to-face format. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Of course there are still logistical issues to address, including classroom set-ups that maintain social distancing, providing deep cleaning, and ensuring that protective gear is worn as appropriate. The health and safety of our students, faculty, and staff remains paramount in the weeks and months ahead.</p>
<p>We are also assessing how and when face-to-face interactions between students and our student services can begin. We are examining admissions testing delivery and college orientation. And of course we hope to have an announcement soon about Commencement, which has been delayed.</p>
<p>A reminder: We will have a process in place in which students can safely visit campus and pick up their caps and gowns on June 5.</p>
<p>Even as summer term is set to begin, I remind you that the window for fall registration is open. This can be done online or over the telephone. Keeping students on track academically and ensuring their academic success is also foremost in our minds.</p>
<p>Next week, we expect additional guidance from the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) that is aimed specifically at higher education institutions. We hope that will provide a better road map to gradually reopening our campuses.</p>
<p>At his press conference yesterday, Governor Roy Cooper reminded North Carolinians that his stay-at-home order remains in effect until May 8. His office is closely monitoring trends and metrics that he hopes will support easing some restrictions later this month.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Next week, we will release more specific information about the Higher Education Emergency Relief Fund (HEERF), which comes under the CARES Act grant program and is meant to assist students with expenses related to disruptions of campus operations due to the COVID-19 pandemic. We will provide information about the application process and the criteria that governs distribution of those funds in an email to students. Our website and other communication channels will also provide those details.</p>
<p>As of Friday morning, the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services reports 10,509 cases of the COVID-19 virus in North Carolina, with 99 in Alamance County. We can expect this number to rise as more citizens are tested more frequently.</p>
<p>Remember, you can help mitigate the spread of this virus by proper hygiene (frequent hand-washing), sanitizing common-touch surfaces, wearing protective masks when in public, limiting travel, and observing social distancing protocols.</p>
<p>We have been under stay-at-home orders since March 27. Because most of North Carolina has been diligent, the curve has been flattened for viral spread and our medical resources have not been overwhelmed.</p>
<p>But as Governor Cooper warned yesterday, complacency is not our friend.</p>
<p>We cannot let down our guard in the days and weeks ahead. Equally important, we must embrace hope. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Dr. Algie C. Gatewood<br />
Alamance Community College President</p>

<p><em>April 24, 2020</em></p>
<p>Dear College Community:</p>
<p>It’s been four weeks since the College transitioned from away face-to-face to online delivery of curriculum instruction. This will continue for the duration of the Spring Semester, through May 8.</p>
<p>I want to emphasize we remain open for business. We’re just doing business in a different way.</p>
<p>The registration window for Summer Semester is open. To register for classes, I encourage you to visit with us by telephone or on our <a href="https://alamancecc.edu">website’s home page</a>. Our plan is to deliver Summer instruction online as well.</p>
<p>This week, as reflected on our website, we shared important information about the College’s <a href="https://www.alamancecc.edu/health-alert/what-you-should-know-your-grades-and-transfer-plans/">Alternate Grading System</a> for Spring. We have provided a <a href="https://www.alamancecc.edu/health-alert/what-you-should-know-your-grades-and-transfer-plans/alternate-grading-system-faq/">detailed FAQ</a> about grading options, which addresses transcript and university transfer issues as well. These options aim to provide more flexibility and optimize student success.</p>
<p>Also this week, the Student Bookstore placed a drop box just inside the front entrance of the main campus for students to return rentals. Please remember the due date for returns is May 11. With the drop box is a spreadsheet listing students and the books they rented. Please check-off or highlight your name at the time of return.</p>
<p>While our skills labs remain temporarily unavailable, I remind everyone: Our <a href="https://www.alamancecc.edu/health-alert/wi-fi-on-campus/">parking lots have free wi-fi</a>, and thus Internet access is available there. Please continue to take advantage of that.</p>
<p>I know many of you have graduation on your minds. Unfortunately, we have made the difficult decision to postpone Commencement in order to protect the health and safety of our students, their families, and our faculty, staff, and guests. The College is still in discussions about the possibility of holding a ceremony in July. No decision has been made, but we hope to share an announcement soon.</p>
<p>Please also be aware that we have postponed cap &amp; gown pick-up on campus until June 5. On that day, in accordance with social distancing guidelines, we will allow students on campus to pick up their caps &amp; gowns. We hope to have a photographer on campus on June 5 as well to take pictures of our proud graduates. More details will be made available.</p>
<p>The College leadership team has formed a sub-group to ask and answer: What does “more normal” look like on campus in the months and years ahead. We will formulate a plan, which will include the use of CDC guidelines for higher education. I’ve asked the sub-group to begin this critical conversation now.</p>
<p>As of today, there are 8,052 COVID-19 cases in North Carolina according to the NC Department of Health and Human Services, 73 of them in Alamance County.</p>
<p>Following social distancing protocols and limiting travel remains our best defense against this pandemic. Some people may be experiencing mild symptoms of the virus – or may be asymptomatic altogether – but they can unknowingly spread this virus.</p>
<p>By staying at home, you are doing your part “to flatten the curve,” decrease the viral spread, and assist the health care system’s response to this pandemic.</p>
<p>As you may know, Governor Roy Cooper announced yesterday that he is extending his shelter-in-place order until May 8. He said he is doing so out of an abundance of caution.</p>
<p>Which is a shared reminder: Stay vigilant. Stay the course. Stay safe. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Dr. Algie C. Gatewood<br />
Alamance Community College President</p>

<p>&nbsp;<em>April 16, 2020</em></p>
<p>Dear College Community,</p>
<p>In the three weeks since our spring break ended and the College transitioned away from face-to-face instruction to all-online delivery, our faculty, staff and students have done an admirable job of meeting the challenges of a socially-distanced world.</p>
<p>More challenges are ahead but I’m confident in the tenacity and perseverance of our College community.</p>
<p>One challenge, as you might expect, are the financial pressures COVID-19 exerts on any institution. We are incurring expenses never before imagined.</p>
<p>On that front, we received some very good news: The College is estimated to receive $2.37 million in federal stimulus funding. The financial relief comes from the Coronavirus Relief Act (CARES Act) approved last month.</p>
<p>Half of that funding can be earmarked for student emergency aid. The U.S. Department of Education has guidelines for using those funds. The other half of that funding is to off-set college costs incurred as a direct result of the pandemic.</p>
<p>Effective April 13, we began limiting inside access to our Main and Dillingham Center campuses to essential employee personnel only. However, both campuses are providing drop-boxes to allow exchanges between students and employees. And of course, faculty and staff continue to be available via phone and email to students and guests.</p>
<p>While our skills labs are temporarily unavailable, I remind everyone: our <a href="https://www.alamancecc.edu/health-alert/wi-fi-on-campus/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">parking lots have wi-fi</a> and we are providing Internet access there.</p>
<p>In the more-good-news department, the Alamance Community College Foundation used funds from an anonymous donor to purchase 100 laptops to assist students with technology challenges.</p>
<p>This week, we opened the <a href="https://www.alamancecc.edu/admissions/summer-school/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">registration window for Summer Semester</a> students. You can learn more about that on our website.</p>
<p>The Summer Semester term, beginning May 18 and concluding July 31, is an excellent opportunity to complete your General Education requirements. It is also an excellent option for many of our area university students who remain sheltered in place and away from such campuses as UNC-Chapel Hill, NCSU, ECU, Elon, and App State. Our online delivery makes this a convenient and affordable option.</p>
<p>I want to emphasize we remain open for business. We’re simply doing business in a different way to meet the challenges.</p>
<p>Let me provide this context: According to the NC Department of Health and Human Services (NCDHHS), as of today (April 16), N.C. reported 5,465 cases of the Coronavirus, 45 in Alamance County.</p>
<p>I want to remind you too of this: Thousands of Alamance Community College graduates – nurses, nurse aids, medical assistants, diagnosticians, paramedics, law enforcement personnel and first responders – are on the front lines right now taking care of the sick. They have placed themselves in harm’s way to help their community.</p>
<p>Help those caregivers by staying at home and practicing social distancing.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Algie&#8230;</p>
<hr>
<p><em>April 9, 2020</em></p>
<p>Dear College Community,</p>
<p>It has been two weeks since our spring break ended and the College transitioned away from face-to-face instruction to all-online delivery, an unprecedented move in light of the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p>I commend our students, faculty, and staff for their commitment to this endeavor and encourage everyone to continue to observe social distancing protocols.</p>
<p>In so maintaining our distance, I think you would agree that the “new normal” is far from normal. We have been sheltered in place for more than two weeks. The governor is likely to announce soon that we may be sheltered in place for two months.</p>
<p>Some students have had questions about graduation. If you are on track academically, if you are progressing with your studies to your instructors’ satisfaction, you will graduate. You will receive your earned credential. College leadership is discussing how we might confer those credentials, and a plan will be shared soon. In fact, I met with a committee on this matter just this morning. The main thing is that students stay on course, so that we can celebrate your success.</p>
<p>I know recent weeks have been difficult. The weeks ahead may prove equally challenging. This will require self-discipline and a commitment to doing your part through social distancing.</p>
<p>In that spirit, let me add this perspective: The College is considered an essential operation because of its educational mission and because our workforce training is critical to battling this virus. Thousands of Alamance Community College graduates – nurses, nurse aids, medical assistants, diagnosticians, paramedics, law enforcement personnel and first responders – are on the front lines right now taking care of the sick, maybe even taking care of your friends or family.</p>
<p>As such, those ACC graduates have put themselves in harm’s way.</p>
<p>As ACC students, faculty, and staff, you can best help their cause by helping stop the virus from spreading. Observing stay-at-home protocols is how we can all contribute. I note that a recent health department assessment of stay-at-home participation in Alamance County was graded a C-minus.</p>
<p>We must do better.</p>
<p>This week, we are making masks and gloves available to the few employees who remain on campus to ensure business continuity. As you might know, most College employees are working remotely.</p>
<p>Next week, effective April 13, we are limiting inside access to our Main and Dillingham Center campuses to essential employee personnel only.</p>
<p>We are operating as a business but doing so slightly differently. That means while our skills labs will be temporarily unavailable, I remind everyone: our parking lots have wi-fi and we are providing Internet access there. Please avail yourself of that access. We must avoid face-to-face interactions wherever possible.</p>
<p>I also remind you that both campuses will provide drop-boxes to allow appropriate exchanges between students and employees.</p>
<p>Here’s a recap of how we got to this stage:</p>
<ul>
<li>In mid-February, we activated our Emergency Operations Plan, providing a structure and process to monitor and mitigate this unique situation. We are continuing to coordinate with the Alamance County Health Department, the Alamance County Emergency Management and appropriate state agencies in monitoring the situation locally and across North Carolina.</li>
<li>We created and posted across campus signage urging proper hygiene practices. We increased daily cleanings of commonly-used surfaces on campus.</li>
<li>The College began official communications about this virus on Feb. 27, building a web site presence to inform students, faculty and staff of ongoing developments.</li>
<li>In early March, we announced that we were extending Student Spring Break an extra week in order to prepare for online, virtual delivery of instruction.</li>
<li>Online delivery began March 23.</li>
<li>In light of the governor’s order to extend shelter in place through April, we announced that online instruction would continue until semester’s end, May 8.</li>
<li>As of today, there are 3,500-plus coronavirus cases in N.C., resulting in 64 deaths. There are now 30 confirmed cases in Alamance County alone.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the coming days, we hope to announce the opening of the registration cycle for summer semester – which we anticipate will also be delivered in an online format. We have been working hard to greatly expand those summer General Education options for students.</p>
<p>Let me close by saying hang in there and hang on to hope. If you recall the old saying, this too shall pass.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Algie&#8230;</p>

<p><em>March 30, 2020</em></p>
<p>Dear College Community,</p>
<p>As you may know, Governor Roy Cooper&#8217;s &#8220;stay at home&#8221; order takes effect today, March 30 and extends through April 29. The governor emphasized that we are fighting now to better defeat the coronavirus in the future.</p>
<p>At this time, educational institutions are exempt from these orders because we represent an essential service.</p>
<p>Our mission is to train the workforce of today and tomorrow, some of whom are training right now to step into careers on the front lines of this pandemic: Nurses, law enforcement, EMT, firefighters, medical assistants, lab technicians. Because community colleges play a vital role, they are deemed an essential service.</p>
<p>However, given the governor&#8217;s month-long shelter in place order, the College will continue our online instruction until May 8, the end of the spring semester. This holds for both curriculum and Continuing Education students.</p>
<p>Under discussion now is when we will open the registration windows for summer and fall semesters. Please be patient; we expect to make an announcement soon.</p>
<p>We are now providing Wi-Fi access in portions of our parking lot (<a href="https://www.alamancecc.edu/health-alert/wi-fi-on-campus/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">map available here</a>). Additionally, while the bookstore is closed, <a href="https://www.bkstr.com/alamanceccstore/home" target="_blank" rel="noopener">orders can be fulfilled online</a> and shipping is now free.</p>
<p>Today, we are posting on our coronavirus-dedicated website page federal guidance regarding the Families First Act and options our employees have regarding the Family Medical Leave Act (FMLA).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Questions have arisen from ACC employees and students regarding working from home and working on campus. Most staff are now working from home. Some are working on campus on staggered schedules.</p>
<p>Until otherwise directed by a government entity, Alamance Community College will continue to maintain essential campus operations to the fullest extent possible while of course respecting safety guidelines from the CDC.</p>
<p>Following are some points of clarification for students, staff, and faculty:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Students &#8211; </strong>Students, regardless of the county in which they reside, will continue to have (restricted) access to campus facilities pursuant to the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.alamancecc.edu/health-alert/">Campus Health Alert posted to the College website</a>&nbsp;on March 26, 2020.&nbsp;Note this does not include students who are under self-quarantine&nbsp;as a result of having traveled to a hot spot such as Washington, California, New York and Massachusetts; any foreign country; or who were recently on a cruise.</li>
<li><strong>Staff &#8211; </strong>Staff deemed by their supervisor as needing to work completely (or partially) on campus to fulfill their duties will be issued Work Authorization Letters signed by the President. In the event that you are stopped by law enforcement, this letter will serve as documentation that you are an essential employee. When traveling to and from the College,&nbsp;please have your college ID and this letter&nbsp;in your possession.</li>
<li><strong>Faculty &#8211; </strong>Faculty will receive Work Authorization Letters upon request only, as the majority of faculty are now teleworking. Requests should go through your Dean.</li>
</ul>
<p>As of this morning, there were 1,206 reported cases of coronavirus in North Carolina, six in Alamance.</p>
<p>Last week, the governor said something that I would like to echo. Social distancing, frequent disinfecting of common surfaces, and frequent hand-washing are our best weapons in the face of a virus in which there is no immunity and no vaccine.</p>
<p><strong>I know our students are working diligently on their academics in an online environment. I know some may be struggling. We’ve urged our instructors to be flexible. If you are struggling, stay in touch with your instructors. They are there to help. Completing your academic journey is our shared goal.</strong></p>
<p>Our being apart brings us together in another shared goal: Beating this virus and protecting loved ones everywhere.</p>

<p>As you may know, Gov. Roy Cooper today issued a statewide “stay at home” order, emphasizing that we are fighting now to better defeat the coronavirus in the future.</p>

<p>Dear College Community,</p>
<p>Next Monday, March 23, our students, staff, faculty, and administration will enter a brave new world of virtual instruction that is college-wide and unprecedented.</p>
<p>This transition has been a tremendous undertaking, one that has consumed the past week for College employees. I am greatly appreciative for everyone’s efforts.</p>
<p>I am also reminded of the old saying “May you live in interesting times” – a rueful saying that carries with it much irony. Yes, we really are living in an interesting time, a time that will challenge us, test us, and strengthen us.</p>
<p>The College is not closed. Our business operations continue. For most of us, our work continues remotely or on a staggered basis. This is to optimize social distancing.</p>
<p>Our plan is to utilize online instruction for two weeks and then reassess virtual delivery before that two-week period expires April 4.</p>
<p>We have added a <a href="https://www.alamancecc.edu/health-alert/hr-message-to-employees/">Frequently-Asked-Questions</a> document from HR to the website, addressing queries from faculty and staff. Feel free to share with your supervisor additional questions that we should consider. I remind everyone that our Board of Trustees is scheduled to meet next week and will consider policy changes that will guide our response to the coronavirus outbreak.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>As of today, March 20, there are 139 reported cases of the coronavirus in North Carolina, including the first case in Alamance County. I am told that individual is isolated from others and doing well.</p>
<p>We have been further advised that testing has increased across our county and our state, and we can expect the number of reported cases to rise.</p>
<p>We activated our Emergency Operations Plan last week and we are continuing to coordinate with the Alamance County Health Department, the Alamance County Emergency Management, and appropriate state agencies in monitoring the situation locally and across North Carolina.</p>
<p>To our students, I ask that they regularly check their <a href="https://www.alamancecc.edu/health-alert/student-email-an-important-message/">ACCess email accounts</a> and monitor our web site for updates. I would further ask that they practice routine hand-washing and practice good social distancing in their respective environments.</p>
<p>I ask faculty and staff to be nimble next week as we navigate these interesting times. I am confident our students and College employees will rise to this challenge and learn something about themselves that only interesting times can impart.</p>
<p>You will find on the College website updated information and advice regarding the coronavirus at <a href="https://www.alamancecc.edu/health-alert/">alamancecc.edu/health-alert/</a>&nbsp; And because what is reported in the media is often conflicting, we suggest the CDC as a reliable source of information.&nbsp; <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-nCoV/summary.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Visit the CDC website here</a>.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Algie&#8230;</p>
