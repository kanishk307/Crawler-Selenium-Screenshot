<p>Dear Augusta Technical College Students, Employees, Family, Friends, and Partners:</p>
&nbsp;

<p>There is no higher priority than the safety and health of our community. As you know, the number of Coronavirus (COVID-19) cases is rising in Georgia. I want to provide you with an update and steps we are taking to reduce risk of infection.</p>

<p>Currently, there have not been any cases of coronavirus exposure to anyone on our campuses. We continue to provide our college community with communications that detail preventative measures people should take to reduce risk of infection. This includes CDC-recommended strategies such like:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Washing hands regularly</li>
	<li>Avoiding the touching of eyes, nose, and mouth</li>
	<li>Covering coughs and sneezes with tissues</li>
	<li>Avoiding close contact with those who may be sick</li>
	<li>Staying home when sick</li>
</ul>

<p>We are&nbsp;following guidance from The Governor&#39;s office, the Center for Disease Control, and the Department of Public Health. We are also taking extra measures to regularly clean and disinfect areas that have high amounts of human contact. This includes lavatories, doorknobs, elevators, and stair railings, among&nbsp;other items. We are monitoring this developing situation closely and we are committed to providing you with accurate information in a timely manner.</p>

<p>Augusta Technical College has a robust emergency response plan and contingency plans that can be called into action if needed. We will update this page regularly to ensure that you remain abreast of information that is received. We thank you for your trust as we continue to provide a safe and healthy environment for you.</p>
